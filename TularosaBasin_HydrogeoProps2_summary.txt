Summary:

• Hydrogeologic Properties: Transmissivity (T) and storage coefficient (S) were determined from an aquifer test (pumping WS-018, observing water-level responses in WS-018 and WS-017). Hydraulic conductivity was also calculated by assuming a 50-foot aquifer thickness.  
• Analysis Method and Tools: The Papadopulos-Cooper model (accounting for wellbore storage in fully penetrating wells) and the AQTESOLV software were used to fit and analyze drawdown and recovery data.  
• Total Dissolved Solids (TDS): Derived from water quality data reflecting saline and fresh water distribution in the basin.  
• Recharge Estimates:  
  – Darcy Flow Approximation from basin-fill aquifer tests.  
  – Basin-Climatic Characteristic Method using drainage basin area and precipitation statistics.  
  – Surplus Precipitation Method identifying the elevation where precipitation exceeds losses.  
• Geologic Mapping and Cross Sections: Completed with field traverses, aerial photography, and 3D visualization tools such as the PG-2 plotter and Stereo Analyst for ArcGIS.  
• Water-Level Measurements: Taken in multiple wells via steel tape and electronic methods, repeated until readings stabilized to within 0.02 feet of accuracy.
