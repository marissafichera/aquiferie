This text repeatedly references whether or not a study defined subsurface structural controls on groundwater flow and what data were used to do so. Some passages state that the study did indeed identify these controls using various methods, such as manual contouring of hydrostratigraphic units and fault planes in ArcMap (drawing on lithologic units from GIS data and structural contour maps), gravity inversion modeling, or seismic and well data. Other passages note that important details from the aquifer report are missing (due to incomplete text extraction), making it impossible to confirm exactly what was done. Still others suggest the provided text does not explicitly describe how structural controls were determined but does acknowledge the role of major faults and potential hydraulic discontinuities in shaping groundwater flow. Overall, the text is inconsistent about whether and how the study established these controls; however, it consistently indicates that faults and subsurface structures influence groundwater flow and that full confirmation of the studyâ€™s methods and findings would require direct access to the complete aquifer report.
