The rate of both wastewater injection and earthquakes in the basin increased dramatically starting in 1999 and 2001, respectively. We compare seismicity (ML 0.0\u20134.3) in the Raton Basin from 2008 to 2010 with the location of modeled pore pressure increases, estimated from cumulative wastewater injection volume beginning at the onset of well injection to present for all 28 injection wells in the basin. We \ufb01nd that modeled pore pressures in the New Mexico portion of the basin (above 0.08 MPa) reached that necessary to induce seismicity (0.01\u20130.1 MPa). We simulate a fault plane, 20 km long, inferred from seismicity in Vermejo Park (1355 of 1881 total earthquakes), in our model. We \ufb01nd that the relatively permeable fault allows pressures to migrate deeper into the basin at the onset of our study in 2008, providing an explanation for the observed seismicity in the basement. The Tercio lineament of earthquakes is similar to Vermejo Park fault in strike, but has fewer earthquakes (129) and is shorter in length (9 km). Seismicity in Vermejo Park occurs continuously, but earthquakes occur episodically in the remainder of the basin. The number of earthquakes we observe in seven seismic clusters increases as the cumulative injected volume from wells within 5 km increases. The modeled pore pressures, earthquake locations, and relationship between cumulative volume and number of earthquakes indicate that seismicity in the Raton Basin is likely induced. 1. Introduction The Raton Basin along the Colorado-New Mexico border hosts coal-bed methane deposits, extraction of which has taken place in the basin since 1999 (Hoffman & Brister, 2003). Underground Injection Control (UIC) class II wells (also referred to as wastewater disposal wells) were permitted beginning in 1988 to dispose of formation wastewater (Colorado Oil and Gas Conservation Commission, 2017; New Mexico Oil and Gas Commission (NMOCD), 2016), although the injection start date of the wells varies from 1994 to 2006, depend- ing on the well. There are currently 28 wastewater disposal wells in the Raton Basin (Figure 1). Historical reports of earthquakes indicate that the Raton Basin region has been seismically active since at least 1966. The earthquake activity increased dramatically starting in the year 2001 making this region an area of interest for possible induced seismicity. Because of geographic boundaries and limited seismic coverage, answering questions about the likelihood of inducedseismicityhasbeendif\ufb01cult.ThebasinisnearlyequallysplitbetweenColoradoandNewMexico,which have different state geological surveys and different historical injection reporting requirements. Reporting of wastewater volumes was not recorded for New Mexico UIC wells from the beginning of injection (late-1990s) to 2006. Previous seismicity studies have focused on the Colorado portion of the Raton Basin because it is the location of a 2001 earthquake swarm and the 2011 MW 5.3 earthquake, both leading to limited augmenta- tion of seismic monitoring in that area. With the availability of the EarthScope Transportable Array (TA) stations to provide additional seismic station coverage throughout the basin, improved earthquake catalogs are now available (Nakai, Sheehan, & Bilek, 2017), allowing a more comprehensive view of seismicity in the entire Raton Basin in order to understand the impact of over a decade of wastewater injection in the basin. The Raton Basin is positioned to the east of the Rio Grande Rift, at the boundary of the Sangre de Cristo Mountains in the Great Plains physiographic province (Figure 1). In the basin, the Pierre shale lies atop the Dakota, Morrison, Entrada, and Glorieta Mesozoic sediments (Pillmore, 1969). These formations overlie NAKAI ET AL.

See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License The Raton Basin \ufb01rst formed in the Pennsylvanian was deepened later in the Cretaceous during Laramide compression and is characterized by volcanic intrusions and Laramide faulting (Baltz, 1965). Coal-bed methane, extracted from the Vermejo and Raton formations (Figure 2), is produced with hydraulic fractur- ing techniques (horizontal perforations in discontinuous coal seams) (Carlton, 2006; Hoffman & Brister, 2003; Environmental Protection Agency, 2015; Papadopulos et al., 2008). Intruding dikes, sills, Laramide faulting, and close proximity to the active Rio Grande Rift characterize the Raton Basin, whose geologic history is a unique combination of volcanism and Tertiary faulting not seen in Paradox Basin (Laramide faulting) and Greeley, CO (basement, but no surface, faulting), or basins in Oklahoma (basement faulting), three previously documented regions of induced seismicity (Keranen et al., 2014; King et al., 2014; Yeck et al., 2016). The western portion of the Raton Basin is marked by thrust faults dipping westward beneath the sedimentary cover, exposing the overturned Dakota formation (Bachman & Dane, 1962; Baltz & Bachman, 1956; Bolyard, 1959; Johnson, 1958; Northrop et al., 1946). The Dakota formation, the primary wastewater injection interval for disposal of wastewater associated with coal-bed methane production (Colorado Oil and Gas Conservation Commission, 2017), is 9\u201318 m (30\u201360 feet) to 30\u201346 m (100\u2013150 feet) in thickness from the southern to the northern Raton Basin and is up to 2.2 km below surface elevation (Figure 2). At several wells, the injection interval extends into the Entrada and Glorieta sandstones, inter- vals just below the Dakota. There is an interval of Pennsylvanian and Early Permian Sangre de Cristo sedi- ments beneath the Glorieta (Baltz, 1965), separating the wastewater disposal interval from Precambrian basement. Volcanic intrusive activity in the Raton Basin occurred from ~30 to 22 Ma. The Spanish Peaks intrusive complex dominates the far northern basin, but dikes and sills abound across the basin. The radial dikes around the Spanish Peaks are generally oriented with the local state of stress created by the intrusions, while the east-west 25 Ma dikes and the northwest-southeast 22 Ma dikes re\ufb02ect the regional stress orientation at the time of emplacement (Miggins, 2002). Currently, the state of stress is approximate east-west extension as evidenced by 25 earthquake moment tensors (Herrmann, 2016). Laramide faulting is profuse on the eastern edge of the Sangre de Cristo Mountains, and features such as the Tres Valles fault in Colorado along the western basin and the Tercio anticline are evidence of thrust faulting at depth (Baltz, 1965; Stevens et al., 1992) (Figure 2).

The Sangre de Cristo formation, suspected to have high permeability, is a target for geothermal circulation given the elevated geotherm in the formation (Bohlen, 2012, 2013). The Yellowstone Caldera (Wyoming) and the Valles Caldera (New Mexico) both have high heat \ufb02ow (Blackwell et al., 2011). Yellowstone is seismically active while the Valles Caldera is nearly aseismic (Nakai et al., 2017; U.S. Geological Survey, 2017). The Raton Basin has been seismically active historically. Shaking from an mb 3.8\u20134.1 earthquake was felt near Cimarron, NM (south edge of the Raton Basin), and Weston, CO (within the Raton Basin) (Stover, Reagor, & Algermissen, 1983; von Hake & Cloud, 1968) on 24 September 1966. Felt reports are documen- ted near Aguilar, Segundo, and Trinidad, CO (within the Raton Basin), from a ML 4.6 earthquake on 3 October 1966 (Stover, Reagor, & Algermissen, 1984). The earliest event in the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Comprehensive Earthquake Catalog (ComCat) is an ML 4.2 on 23 September 1973 near Valdez, CO (within the Raton Basin) (U.S. Geological Survey, 2017), and four other earthquakes were reported but not located instrumentally from 19 to 23 September 1973 (Coffmann et al., 1975; U.S. Geological Survey, 2017).

The New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology\u2019s seismic catalog from 1962 to 1998 contains four events >Md 1.3 in our study area (Figure 1) (Sanford et al., 2002). Catalogs developed by Sanford et al. (2006) and Pursley, Bilek, and Ruhl (2013) for 1999 to 2008 (prior to the start of this catalog) contain 78 earthquakes in the study area. The closest station used in the New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology locations is SDCO, ~80 km northeast of the earthquakes, and there was a large azimuthal gap in station coverage to the north, east, and south. The location uncertainties in the Raton Basin are high for these catalogs (~10 km) (Sanford et al., 2006). There are 129 earthquakes >ML 3 in the USGS ComCat catalog from 1999 to 2016, and 15 earthquakes >ML 4, with eight in Colorado and seven in New Mexico (U.S. Geological Survey, 2017). A swarm of 12 earthquakes in August and September 2001, ranging in magnitude from 2.8 to 4.6, prompted the USGS to deploy a temporary seismometer array west of Trinidad, CO (Meremonte et al., 2002). That deployment recorded 39 earthquakes from 3 to 6 km depth in a 6 km long, northeast striking, steeply dipping (70\u201380\u00b0) fault plane. There were several \ufb02uid disposal wells within 5 km of the earthquake sequence. The 2001 earthquake sequence satis\ufb01ed some but not all of the criteria popular at the time for distinguishing induced earthquake sequences (Davis & Frohlich, 1993). The sequence was not uniformly identi\ufb01ed as induced. This was based on the prior history of earthquakes in the area, the 1 year time lag between the start of nearby well injection and the earthquakes, and the underpressured nature of the Dakota formation, which Meremonte et al. (2002) (incorrectly) suggested would preclude high pore pressure increases in the Dakota. On 23 August 2011, an MW 5.3 earthquake in the Raton Basin caused shaking and damage in nearby Trinidad, CO. The USGS deployed a temporary seismometer array from August to December 2011 to study the after- shocks of this earthquake. Rubinstein et al. (2014) recognized two fault strands, one striking north-south and one striking northeast-southwest, and concluded that the earthquakes occurred along a fault ~8 km deep, and were the result of wastewater injection in the VPRC 14/39 wells and the Wild Boar and PCW wells farther north. The existence of an 8 to 10 km long fault plane was corroborated by Barnhart et al. (2014) using interferometric synthetic aperture radar observations (Figure 1). The majority of analysis has focused on the Colorado portion of the Raton Basin because it is the location of the 2001 earthquake swarm and the 2011 MW 5.3 earthquake, though the number of moderate mag- nitude (>magnitude 3) earthquakes have increased as well in the New Mexico portion of the basin since 2001 (Figure S1 in the supporting information). In this work, we compare the seismicity patterns observed during the USArray and CREST seismometer deployments (from 2008 to 2010) with hydrogeologic mod- eling to show that the pressure generated from the cumulative injection in New Mexico could far exceed the pressure necessary to induce earthquakes in the southern basin, and a permeable fault we simulated in the model allows pressures to migrate deeper into the basement. We explore the relationship between cumulative injection volume and the number of earthquakes for the observed time period, and note dif- ferences in seismicity in Vermejo Park in comparison to the earthquake clusters in Tercio and the remain- der of the basin.

We used only arrivals with an epicentral distance of less than 170 km in the inversion to avoid \ufb01tting scatter in the travel time data due to Pg to Pn crossovers. We constructed Wadati diagrams (Wadati, 1933) to determine the Vp/Vs ratio for the starting S wave velocity models, but VELEST independently inverts for the S wave velocity model. Two of our \ufb01nal velocity models were very similar, the \u201cslow\u201d and \u201cmedium\u201d models. The slow model had a slower upper crust and a faster lower crust in both P and S wave velocity in comparison to the medium model. The medium model was the model used for the \ufb01nal locations. The \u201cfast\u201d model was fast throughout the lower and upper crust for P and S wave velocities (all models given in Table S1 in the supporting informa- tion). The VELEST average RMS residual and the data variance for these models were similar (~0.14 s RMS resi- dual), and the \ufb01nal model was chosen based on visual \ufb01t of the data to the reduced predicted travel time curves. We \ufb01xed the upper mantle P wave speed to 8.00 km/s as observed on the reduced travel time curves and S wave upper mantle speeds to 4.3 km/s for S wave velocities (Shen, Ritzwoller, & Schulte-Pelkum, 2013). Earthquakes were relocated with Bayesloc (Myers, Johannesson, & Hanley, 2007, 2009), and only arrivals within 1.7\u00b0 were used in the relocations to avoid the Pn phase. The epicentral errors for the catalog are \u00b12 km for the Colorado and New Mexico catalog based on mine blast relocations (Nakai et al., 2017). The shal- low structure (upper 5 km) is not well resolved due to distant station spacing, and we do not have enough arrivals at the close distance range needed to resolve shallow layers. These shallow structures are important for resolving the depths of near-surface earthquakes, and we adopt the Bayesloc depth errors with the under- standing that there is an inherent bias error in earthquake depths. Bayesloc depths are with respect to the average elevation in the Raton Basin. Relocated epicenters were nearly identical for the three models deter- mined from the 1-D inversion, although the depths varied. Regardless of which of the three models we used, the majority of earthquake depths were between 4 and 6 km, at basement depths. This agrees with the depths Rubinstein et al. (2014) determined in the Colorado part of the Raton Basin. Depths for four larger earthquakes were within 2 to 5 km of the regional moment tensors determined by Herrmann (2016). The depth of the regional moment tensors is chosen as the maximum value of best \ufb01t as a function of depth. The uncertainty varies with the depth sensitivity for waveform mechanisms. 2.2. Injection Well Data Monthly injection volumes by injection well were obtained online from the Colorado Oil and Gas Conservation Commission (2017) and NMOCD (2016). Data from October 1999 to May 2006 are not available for New Mexico wells, which led Rubinstein et al. (2014) to use produced water data from coal-bed methane wells in New Mexico as a proxy for injection volumes. The produced water is a reasonable proxy for injection data because nearly 100% of water produced is injected in the area, and post-2006, when production and injection data are both available, the two volumes correlate well, with the exception of 580,000 barrel in 1 month of 2009 (Rubinstein et al., 2014). We use the produced water data to estimate October 1999 to May 2006 injection volumes from six wells in New Mexico. The June 2006 to May 2008 average monthly volumes were used as a baseline of well injection.

Qi is the \ufb02uid source or sink (T\u00021). Hydraulic conductivity is relatable to permeability by accounting for the speci\ufb01c weight and dynamic viscosity of water (Figure 3). The model inputs are based on the reported hydrostratigraphy of the sedimentary layering from Geldon (1989) and use the reported ranges in bulk permeability from \ufb01eld studies and calibrated numerical models of similar strata in other basins (Table S4; Belitz & Bredehoeft, 1988; Garavito, Kooi, & Neuzil, 2006; Miller & Rahn, 1974). Permeability of the intact crystalline basement relies on the permeability-depth relationship derived by Shmonov et al. (2003): log k \u00bc \u000212:56 \u0002 3:225z0:223 (2) where k is the permeability (m2) and z is the depth (km). This relationship generally gives permeabilities that are about an order of magnitude lower for crystalline basement at similar depths than values from other notable k-z relationships such as Manning and Ingebritsen (1999). The layered heterogeneity of the sedimentary system is re\ufb02ected in the modeled permeabilities with depth. A description of the formations above and below the injection horizon as well as heterogeneous layering included in the model is detailed in Figure S2 and Tables S4 and S5 (Bredehoeft, Neuzil, & Milly, 1983; Harbaugh & Davie, 1964; Jensen et al., 1954; Topper, Scott, & Watterson, 2011; Watts, 2006). The pressures cal- culated in the model runs are well below the reported underpressures in the basin, meaning that wastewater disposal can occur without the need for wellhead pressure (Rubinstein & Mahani, 2015). In this study, we adapt the numerical model developed by Weingarten et al. (2015) to simulate \ufb02uid pressure changes in the Raton Basin that includes the Vermejo Park fault zone. The adapted model speci\ufb01cally considers vertical \ufb02ow in a complex of fault damage zones (Vermejo Park fault zone) nested inside an otherwise lower permeability sediment and crystalline basement (Figure 3 and Figures S2 and S3). Figure 3 shows the permeability structure and boundary conditions of the hydrostatigraphic units for the base case model (Table S4). While damage zones are highly anisotropic, several case studies of \ufb02ow along fault damage zones have quanti\ufb01ed the typical range of bulk diffusivities, the ratio between hydraulic conductivity and speci\ufb01c storage, to be 0.01 to 0.5 m2/s (Goebel et al., 2017; Xue et al., 2013). We simulate a range of permeabilities that correspond to bulk diffusivities in this range for the Vermejo Park fault zone and Figure 3. Parameterization, boundary conditions, and vertical discretization of the base hydrogeologic model. Parameterization of the fault zone sensitivity analysis and plan view discretization are shown in Table S4 and Figure S6.

Results Magnitudes for earthquakes in the basin in our catalog range from ML 0.0 to 4.3, and we \ufb01nd a b value of 0.90 using the maximum curvature method (Wiemer & Wyss, 2000). The magnitude completeness is ML 1.3 in the Raton Basin, as in the Nakai et al. (2017) catalog. Estimated b values for induced earthquakes span a wide range, from 0.6 to 2.1 (van der Elst et al., 2016). Earthquakes in the Raton Basin account for 29.4% of the cumulative seismic moment in the USGS ComCat catalog from 1973 to 2016 in Colorado and New Mexico. In the context of the regional earth- quake catalog in Colorado and New Mexico from February 2008 to February 2010, the Raton Basin was by far the most seismically active area (Figure S4). Nearly 62% (1881/2764) of the earthquakes in the Rio Grande Rift catalog (Nakai et al., 2017) locate within the Raton Basin. Within the Raton Basin itself, seismicity varies both spatially and temporally. The extent of concentrated earthquake activity in the basin is in an area of ~80 km \u00d7 40 km with wells interspersed ~10 km apart. The catalog in the Raton Basin consists of 1881 earth- quakes from February 2008 to February 2010 (Figure 1). The majority of these events are located inside the Raton Basin, although there are isolated earthquakes outside the geological basin that are included in the maps for local context of seismicity. The emphasis on earthquake activity thus far in the Raton Basin has been on the Colorado section of the Raton Basin (Barnhart et al., 2014; Rubinstein et al., 2014).

The emphasis on earthquake activity thus far in the Raton Basin has been on the Colorado section of the Raton Basin (Barnhart et al., 2014; Rubinstein et al., 2014). Figure S1 shows that the New Mexico part of the Raton Basin has a similar number of MW 3.0 and greater earthquakes. The 2001 earthquake swarm (up to magnitude 4.6) and the 2011 MW 5.3 both occurred in the Colorado part of the Raton Basin. Moment release within the Raton Basin in New Mexico from 1973 to 2016 is 28% of the total compared to 72% in Colorado. When comparing estimated cumulative volume versus number of earthquakes (Figure 4; data in Figure S5 and Table S2), we found that cumulative injected volume is correlated with the number of earthquakes in nearby clus- ters. Well volumes are the sum since the time the wells began injection, which varies for individual wells, to February 2010. The cumulative volume is a sum of the well volumes from wells within 5 km (from the closest point, not the centroid) of each de\ufb01ned cluster, although we also considered distances of 10 km and 15 km. The clusters are chosen as continuous groups of earthquakes which have a well within 5 km. Figure 4 shows cumulative volume injected versus number of earthquakes on a log-log plot. For wells within 5 km of our identi\ufb01ed earth- quake clusters, the cumulative volume correlates with earthquake frequency (Pearson\u2019s correlation coef\ufb01cient of 0.77) (Figure 4). Considering wells within 10 km and 15 km of clusters, the correlation coef\ufb01cients decrease to 0.68 and 0.72, respectively. As the cumulative volume from nearby wells increases, the number of earthquakes observed increases. We show the number of earthquakes and cumulative injection volume in Figures S6a and S6b. The Vermejo Park fault is continuously seismically active throughout the 2008 to 2010 observation period, and the Tercio fault and the remaining clusters have periods of quiescence in time (Figure 5). In the 2008\u20132010 time period, we observe only one small earthquake within 5 km of the epicenter of the 2011 MW 5.3 earth- quake (Figure 1). One ML 1.33 earthquake was located 3 km southwest of Well 9 on the NNE-SSW fault identi- \ufb01ed by Rubinstein et al. (2014) and Barnhart et al. (2014), and 9 km north of the fault we \ufb01nd that a cluster of earthquakes occurs near Boncarbo in 2008\u20132010 (Figure 1). Our catalog (Nakai et al., 2017) is not a result of a network deployed speci\ufb01cally to study aftershocks of a large earthquake (e.g., 2001 and 2011). It seems unli- kely that the earthquakes in this study are a long-lived aftershock sequence, given that the number of mag- nitude 3 and above earthquakes returned to background levels the year following the 2011 MW 5.3 earthquake in Colorado, and the next most recent earthquake >MW 5.0 was a MWc 5.0 in 2005. The Vermejo Park seismicity may very well be a continuation of a swarm that began before 2008; in fact, several Figure 4.

The pore pressure has potentially been high enough (Figure S8) such that these events may have been induced. There are \ufb01ve additional clusters of earthquakes that we observed in the 2008 to 2010 time period: from the north, Gulnare (91 earthquakes), Spanish Peaks Foothills (18), Boncarbo (60), Weston (37), and Valle Vidal (57) (Figure 1). There are numerous east west striking dikes near Gulnare, Boncarbo, Weston, and Spanish Peaks Foothills, and they are bounded to the north by the west and east Spanish Peak intrusive mountains. An 11 km long southeast striking ma\ufb01c sill strikes divide well 26 from the Vermejo Park fault. On the southwest side of this sill, at a northwest-southeast strike, are the Valle Vidal earthquakes. All of these clusters had wells within 5 km (Table S2). We took the derivative of the cumulative number of earthquakes and plotted a 10 day average derivative for three earthquake groups (Figure 5b). In 668 days, the average derivative for Vermejo Park is 2.0 (median of 1.5); for the grouped clusters of earthquakes the average derivative is 0.4 (median of 0) and 0.2 for Tercio (median of 0). A derivative of 0.5 or less means that 0 to 1 earthquakes occurred the day of or after a given day. The derivative is clearly much higher for Vermejo Park seismicity than Tercio and the rest of the earth- quake clusters combined together (Figure 5b). We examine seismicity patterns in the two areas with the highest number of earthquakes in the studied per- iod (2008\u20132010): Vermejo Park and Tercio (Figure 6). The majority of the 2008\u20132010 events (1355) are located in a distinct lineament (that we infer is a fault) surrounded by six wells in New Mexico. These events relocate into a 20 km long lineation that strikes north-south which we de\ufb01ne as the Vermejo Park fault (Figures 6a and 6c). Except for an absence of earthquakes several days prior to a MW 4.0 on 29 July 2009, earthquakes in Vermejo Park occur continuously.

Some earthquakes located in 2011 were in the vicinity of Vermejo Park (Rubinstein et al., 2014), but the Vermejo Park seismic lineament has not been previously recognized as a highly active area of small-magnitude seismicity with a coherent linear pattern. We do not observe a spatial migration of these earthquakes through time or depth for the short time period from 2008 to 2010. The depths range from 1 to 15 km, measured from a surface elevation of ~2 km with the majority of earthquakes in the 4\u20135 km depth range, with uncertainty of 2\u20135 km (see section 2). The depth range is corroborated by seismic moment tensors (Herrmann, 2016), which place basin-wide earthquakes from 1 to 9 km (majority at 3\u20134 km depth) and New Mexico earthquakes from 3 to 9 km (majority at 4 km depth). There is a seismic gap along strike of the fault 6 km from the north end (Figure 6a). Allowing for error in the location of the 2005 MWc 5.0 earthquake, it is possible that the seismic gap is due to this event. The fault appears to be stee- ply dipping (Figure 6) but given hypocenter uncertainty should be interpreted with caution. The feature that we refer to as the Tercio fault (Figures 6b and 6d), inferred from seismicity, also strikes north- south, similar to the Vermejo Park fault, but is only 9 km in length with 129 earthquakes in the 2008 to 2010 per- iod.Thefaultdipasestimatedfromthe seismicityisnearverticalandtheearthquakes areshallower thanforthe Figure 5.

The southern half of seismicity is aligned with the Tercio anticline (Stevens et al., 1992), which is along the western edge of the Raton Basin, adjacent to the exposed Dakota formation and mapped surface thrust faults (Figures 1 and 6). We modeled pore pressures across the Raton Basin, incorporating the derived 1999\u20132006 injection volumes in New Mexico into the cumulative volume history. As described in section 2, we used the produced water data to estimate 1999\u20132006 injection volumes from six wells in New Mexico. All wells operating in the basin contribute to the pore pressure changes in the basin. By February 2010, the pressure perturbation from injec- tion has spread throughout most of the dominant injection reservoir, the Dakota formation (Figure 7). We focus on the pore pressure changes in the New Mexico portion of the basin, speci\ufb01cally along the Vermejo Park fault zone above 0.08 MPa pressure (green contour in Figure 7), which is 8 times the threshold at which earthquakes may be triggered from injection (Hornbach et al., 2015; Keranen et al., 2014), includes most of the Vermejo Park earthquake cluster at the onset of this study"

The southern half of seismicity is aligned with the Tercio anticline (Stevens et al., 1992), which is along the western edge of the Raton Basin, adjacent to the exposed Dakota formation and mapped surface thrust faults (Figures 1 and 6). We modeled pore pressures across the Raton Basin, incorporating the derived 1999\u20132006 injection volumes in New Mexico into the cumulative volume history. As described in section 2, we used the produced water data to estimate 1999\u20132006 injection volumes from six wells in New Mexico. All wells operating in the basin contribute to the pore pressure changes in the basin. By February 2010, the pressure perturbation from injec- tion has spread throughout most of the dominant injection reservoir, the Dakota formation (Figure 7). We focus on the pore pressure changes in the New Mexico portion of the basin, speci\ufb01cally along the Vermejo Park fault zone above 0.08 MPa pressure (green contour in Figure 7), which is 8 times the threshold at which earthquakes may be triggered from injection (Hornbach et al., 2015; Keranen et al., 2014), includes most of the Vermejo Park earthquake cluster at the onset of this study in 2008 (Figure S8). When the Vermejo Park seismic lineament is modeled as a permeable fault, the model predicts pressure perturbations reaching Figure 7.

See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License depths of 12\u201313 km by February 2010 (Figure 7b). Pressure changes above 0.2 MPa can be observed at base- ment depths below ~2.5 km. The highest-volume wells in the basin were operating in the region of the high- est modeled pressures (red in Figure 7). We identify high cumulative volume wells over the time period 1994 to 2008 (the onset of this study) as those with greater than 15 million barrels of water injected. Those wells are 8 and 19 in Colorado and 22, 23, 27, and 28 in New Mexico (Figure 1). The wells 22 and 23 are collocated and as a point source, have injected more than double the water of any other well in the basin. Sensitivity analysis of the modeled pressure perturbation in the Vermejo Park fault zone shows that pressure changes through time are sensitive to fault zone permeability (Figure 7c). Varying the fault zone permeability from that of intact crystalline basement (i.e., no fault) to as high as 3 \u00d7 10\u00025 m2 yields pressure changes at 4.5 km depth from 0.004 to 0.1 MPa. All models show pressure changes increasing with time, including throughout the time period of interest of this study from 2008 to 2010. The pressure history from the lower bound of the modeled permeable fault zones (10\u000216 m2) shows that pressure changes at depth are signi\ufb01- cant and likely large enough to trigger seismicity at seismogenic depths. 4. Discussion The Pierre shale above the Dakota serves as a \ufb02uid \ufb02ow barrier, which effectively prevents \ufb02uids from migrat- ing upward; thus, modeled \ufb02uid pressure in the Raton Basin propagates primarily laterally in the Dakota, Entrada, and Sangre de Cristo formations and diffuses downward into basement rock (Figure 7b). We did not observe any seismicity in 2008\u20132010 near the MW 5.3 earthquake in 2011. The active seismicity in New Mexico has not been documented to the extent that the Colorado seismicity has, but the number of small- magnitude earthquakes during the 2008 to 2010 time period is much higher in the New Mexico basin than in Colorado (Figure 1), and slightly higher in New Mexico for earthquakes >MW 3 (Figure S1). In terms of moment release during 2008 to 2010, 26% of the moment release occurred in Colorado while 74% occurred in New Mexico, while 72% of long-term moment release (1973 to 2016) is in Colorado and 28% is in New Mexico (magnitude 2.5 and above). We note that hydraulic fracturing, associated with earthquakes in other areas (e.g., Holland, 2013; Schultz et al., 2017; Skoumal, Brudzinski, & Currie, 2015), does occur in the Raton Basin in the Raton and Vermejo formations (Figure 2) (Carlton, 2006). We have not assessed the impact hydraulic fracturing may have on the potential for earthquakes in the Raton Basin. Although there is strong evidence that earthquakes in the Raton Basin are induced (Rubinstein et al., 2014), no quanti\ufb01ed causative mechanism has previously been shown to drive these earthquakes. Our pore pres- sure modeling shows that pore pressure in the basement rock can exceed the threshold at which earth- quakes are induced (>0.01\u20130.1 MPa). The pore pressure for the majority of the basin populated by wells exceeds triggering thresholds observed in Oklahoma (0.07 MPa) (Keranen et al., 2014), the Ellenburger forma- tion in north Texas (0.09 MPa) (Hornbach et al., 2016), and in Azle, TX (0.01 to 0.2 MPa) (Hornbach et al., 2015). The highest pore pressure in the basin is in the region where we observe the highest number of earthquakes in 2008\u20132010, and the high-volume wells (22 and 23) are within 10 km of six earthquakes >MW 3. We simu- lated a permeable (relative to the surrounding crystalline basement) fault that allows pore pressures to migrate below the sedimentary disposal interval into the basement. The pattern of seismicity in Vermejo Park is consistent with high pore pressures"

We simu- lated a permeable (relative to the surrounding crystalline basement) fault that allows pore pressures to migrate below the sedimentary disposal interval into the basement. The pattern of seismicity in Vermejo Park is consistent with high pore pressures near high-volume wells and a basement fault. Figure 7b demon- strates the effect of adding a permeable fault to the model, which is the increase in pore pressure at seismo- genic depths. This is one explanation for the spatial pattern of seismicity in Vermejo Park we observe: the modeled fault has allowed pressures to migrate far along the fault to the south of the high-volume wells. Poroelastic stress effects may play a role in earthquake triggering in the Raton Basin, and a geomechanical model (Fan, Eichhubl, & Gale, 2016; Goebel et al., 2017) of the basin would be potentially bene\ufb01cial. The regional horizontal least compressive stress orientation is east-west in and around the Rio Grande Rift (Berglund et al., 2012), although the orientation of stress changes in eastern Colorado, according to recent earthquake moment tensors (Herrmann, 2016) and historical stress data (Zoback & Zoback, 1980). Lund Snee and Zoback (2016) inverted moment tensors in the Raton Basin and determined a maximum horizontal stress direction of 167.1\u00b0. Three moment tensors in the Vermejo Park seismic lineament are consistent in strike with our interpretation of a north-south striking normal fault (Figure 6c). If the Vermejo Park fault is one continuous fault, the length is greater than the Pawnee fault in Oklahoma on which a MW 5.8 earthquake occurred (Yeck et al., 2017) and similar in length to the Fairview fault, also in Oklahoma, on which a MW 5.1 Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth 10.1002/2017JB014415 NAKAI ET AL.

See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License earthquake occurred (Yeck et al., 2016). In 2005, a MWc 5.0 earthquake occurred near the north of the Vermejo Park fault, the largest earthquake in New Mexico Raton Basin in the USGS ComCat (U.S. Geological Survey, 2017). The strike and dip of the 2005 earthquake was 160\u00b0 and 40\u00b0 (or 5\u00b0 and 53\u00b0) with a depth of 4 km. The moment tensor (Herrmann, 2016) for this earthquake located 2.5 km to the west of the USGS location, hinting at the epicentral uncertainty of the location, although the uncertainty in regional network locations is ~15 km (Rubinstein et al., 2014). The moment tensor location is coincident with the Vermejo Park lineament and it is possible that the 2005 earthquake took place on the fault. The dip of the earthquakes is dif\ufb01cult to reconcile with the seismicity we observe, which is may be taking place on en echelon splays off the larger fault and appears as a vertical cloud in section. The Tercio fault is similar, although shorter in length (9 km), less seismically active (129 earthquakes), and the seismicity is shallower (1\u201311 km). The lineation of seismicity and the presence of mapped surface faults 10\u201315 km west of Tercio are strong evidence that this is also a fault striking north-south that has been acti- vated by high pore pressures. Displacement of basin sediments along the Tres Valles fault ends north of the Tercio anticline, but likely displaces the Precambrian granite in the anticline (Stevens et al., 1992). A MW 3.5 earthquake occurred 4 km east of the Tercio fault (4 December 2012) with a moment tensor indicating east-west normal faulting, while a moment tensor for an MW 3.53 earthquake on 29 September 2009 at the northeast terminus of the fault indicates slight southwest-northeast directed normal faulting (Figure 6b). We note that our earthquake depths extend from shallow (1\u20132 km depending on the velocity model used) to 15\u201320 km. The shallow depths are not well determined, but the majority of earthquakes occur at 4\u20136 km in all three models. Although we do not have good constraints on depth due to station spacing, we are con\ufb01dent that many of the earthquakes lie in the basement. In the Paradox Basin of western Colorado, where continuous injection of salt water at a single well began in 1996, the vast majority of earthquakes lie in the sedimentary layers above the basement near the depth of injection (4.88 km), although earthquakes occur up to 6.5 km in depth (Block, 2010). In Fairview, OK, earthquakes occur up to 6.5 km below the sedimentary-basement inter- face, and the majority of earthquakes occur from 6 to 9 km depth (Yeck et al., 2016). In Greeley, CO, the majority of the earthquakes occur in the basement, at less than 6 km depth (Yeck et al., 2016). McNamara et al. (2015) found aftershocks of the MW 5.6 Prague, OK, earthquake at depths of 1\u201310 km. Induced earthquakes in north Texas are <8 km deep, ranging from the top of the Ellenburger disposal formation (1 km to 2.8 km) into the basement (Hornbach et al., 2016). The depth extent of the Raton earthquakes is unusually deep, and although wefocusonthe observationthatthe majorityoccur at4\u20136kmdepth,this isaninterestingtopicforfuturestudy. These Vermejo Park and Tercio faults are likely suitably oriented normal faults in the east-west stress regime if two of these seismic lineaments are observed. These high-density linear patterns of seismicity with a scarcity of earthquakes surrounding the lineament are similar between Vermejo Park, Tercio, and the Fairview, OK, faults, on which a MW 5.1 occurred at 8\u201310 km depth (Yeck et al., 2016). This is similar to lineaments in Arkansas and Kansas (Choy et al., 2016;"

This is similar to lineaments in Arkansas and Kansas (Choy et al., 2016; Horton, 2012). If we take a subsurface rupture length of 10\u201320 km, the Vermejo Park and Tercio faults could potentially produce a magnitude 6 to 6.5 earthquake (Wells & Coppersmith, 1994). As cumulative volume injected increases, the number of earthquakes tends to increase (Frohlich et al., 2011). For wells within 5 km of our identi\ufb01ed earthquake clusters, the cumulative volume correlates with earthquake frequency (Pearson\u2019s correlation coef\ufb01cient of 0.77) (Figure 4). Considering wells within 10 km and 15 km of clusters, the correlation coef\ufb01cients decrease to 0.68 and 0.72. A similar relationship between cumulative volume and earthquake frequency has been reported in the Carthage Cotton Valley Gas Field, TX (Rutledge, Phillips, & Mayerhofer, 2004). The Raton Basin has a cumulative injected volume of 45 million bar- rels of water since 1994, compared to 1.7 billion barrels of water in the Ellenburger formation, TX, since 2006. We see two types of seismicity in the basin, continuous and episodic (Figure 5). We de\ufb01ne continuous earthquakes as those with an average derivative (earthquakes/day) of 1.0 or higher (Figure 5b), although this may vary based on the magnitude completeness of a catalog and detection threshold of the seismic network. Continuous seismi- city refers to relatively steady increase in number of earthquakes over the catalog period, whereas discrete pulses of seismic activity with gaps of time between earthquakes characterize the episodic seismicity (Figure 5). Vermejo Park seismicity is continuous and is near the locus of the highest changes in pore pressure in the basin (when a fault is simulated), whereas the episodic seismicity is in regions of lower changes in pore pressure (~0.08 MPa in Figure 7). Episodic seismicity has been observed in areas of induced seismicity, for example, in the 2008\u20132009 Dallas-Fort Worth sequence and the 2009\u20132010 Cleburne, TX, sequence (Frohlich et al., 2011; Justinic et al., Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth 10.1002/2017JB014415 NAKAI ET AL.

See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License 2013). In northern Texas, induced seismicity does not follow a main shock-aftershock pattern but is characterized by swarms of small earthquakes (Hornbach et al., 2016). Episodic seismicity from 1975 to 1977 with a magnitude detection threshold of 2.0 is also observed in the Permian Basin near the Texas-New Mexico border and is spatially clustered (Rogers & Malkiel, 1979). Given the fact that a MWc 5.0 has occurred in New Mexico, a MW 5.3 has occurred in Colorado, and the wells continue to dispose of wastewater, continually raising the basin pore pressure, we expect that the earthquake hazard is substantial in the Raton Basin. 5. Conclusions We show that elevated pore pressures can exist in the Raton Basin, especially in New Mexico, at suf\ufb01cient levels (>0.03 MPa) to induce earthquakes as early as May 2005, provided that the Vermejo Park fault is simulated. The two most seismically active faults during this time period are the Vermejo Park and Tercio lineaments. We model the Vermejo Park fault as a fault plane in the hydrogeologic model, which results in pressures of ~0.08 MPa at 9 km depth (well below basement). In Vermejo Park, this is indicated by three north-south striking normal faulting moment tensors within the cluster and north-south seismicity alignment. Tercio is 10 to 15 km east of the faulted and exposed Sangre de Cristo formation and Precambrian granite of the Sangre de Cristo Mountains, is a 9 km north-south alignment of seismicity at basement depths, with two normal faulting moment tensors within 5 km of the lineament. Although the depths are not well constrained due to station spa- cing, the majority are likely at basement depths, which is common in other cases of induced seismicity. The number of earthquakes of the observed clusters is directly correlated to the cumulative injection volume from wells within 5 km of the seismicity. As the cumulative volume of wastewater injection increases, the pore pressure nearby increases, increasing the likelihood that earthquakes will be triggered on existing faults. If this relationship holds, we would expect to see an overall increase of small-magnitude seismicity as the pore pressure continually increases in the basin. We observe two types of seismicity in the Raton Basin, con- tinuous and episodic. Vermejo Park is continuously active, and the remainder of the clusters and the Tercio fault are episodically active.Four main lines of evidence support the contention that seismicity in the Raton Basin is induced from long-term wastewater injection: 1. The spatial patterns of seismicity we observe are re\ufb02ected in distribution of wastewater injection and modeled pore pressure change when a fault is simulated. 2. Modeled pore pressures at seismogenic depths are well above the earthquake-triggering threshold under a variety of possible fault permeability scenarios. 3. There is a power law relationship between cumulative wastewater disposal volume and number earthquakes. 4. There is a similarity between of patterns of seismicity (basement earthquakes, seismic lineaments, and spatial clustering) in the Raton Basin and other regions with induced seismicity.
