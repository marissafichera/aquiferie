The study’s dataset is a blend of newly collected information and existing datasets compiled from multiple sources. These sources include geologic mapping by Connell (2008b) and others, previous contouring efforts, the USGS National Water Information System, well infrastructure data from various contributors, and measurements from the USGS-ABCWUA monitoring network. Additionally, wireline logs for multiple wells and data from a field campaign—such as observations of fault zones—were collected by the USGS specifically for this analysis. References to prior studies (for example, Spiegel and Baldwin, Chapin and Cather, Lozinsky, Tedford et al.) also indicate that substantial portions of previously published and unpublished data were integrated. Overall, the study relied on both new data collection and the incorporation of a broad range of existing hydrogeologic and geophysical information.
