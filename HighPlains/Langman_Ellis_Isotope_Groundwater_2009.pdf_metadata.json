McMahon a b s t r a c t Declining water levels in arid and semi-arid regions increase an aquifer\u2019s vulnerability to natural and anthropogenic in\ufb02uences. A multi-isotope (dD, d18O, 87Sr/86Sr, and d11B) approach was used to resolve the geochemical evolution of groundwater in a declining aquifer in a semi-arid region of the southwest- ern USA as groundwater composition reacts to source-water mixing, cross-formational \ufb02ow including saltwater intrusion, water\u2013rock interaction, and likely agricultural recharge. Sub-aquifers or local \ufb02ow systems are present in the Southern High Plains aquifer along the Western Caprock Escarpment in New Mexico, and the study site\u2019s local \ufb02ow system contains a Na\u2013Cl, high dissolved-solids groundwater that \ufb02ows from the escarpment until it mixes with a high quality regional aquifer or regional \ufb02ow system. The local \ufb02ow system contains water that is similar in composition to the underlying, upper Dockum Group aquifer. Saltwater found in the upper Dockum Group aquifer likely originates in the adjacent Pecos River Basin and crosses beneath or possibly through the hydrologic divide of the Western Caprock Escarp- ment. Strontium concentrations of 0.9\u201331 mg/L and a 87Sr/86Sr range of 0.70845\u20130.70906 were suf\ufb01cient to estimate source-water fractions, mixing patterns, and contributions from chemical weathering through mass balance inverse calculations. Boron concentrations (59\u20131740 mg/L) and d11B values (+6.0\u2013+46.0\u2030) were used to con\ufb01rm source-water mixing, further evaluate water\u2013rock interaction, and examine the in\ufb02uence of possible agricultural recharge. Alteration of B concentrations and d11B val- ues in an area of likely agricultural recharge indicated the loss of B and decrease in d11B values likely from plant uptake, adsorption, and weathering contributions in the soil/vadose zone prior to recharge. The effectiveness of 87Sr/86Sr and d11B for resolving the geochemical in\ufb02uences in groundwater in the South- ern High Plains along the Western Caprock Escarpment allowed for the reinterpretation of the isotopic composition of water that has been shown to be highly variable in the Southern High Plains. This study shows the utility of a multi-isotope approach for resolving the geochemical evolution of groundwater in an aquifer that has a complex relationship with underlying aquifers and the applicability of these iso- topes as indicators of the alteration of source waters from natural or anthropogenic in\ufb02uences. \u0002 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Introduction Freshwater resources in arid and semi-arid areas are highly vul- nerable to drought and climate change (Kundzewicz et al., 2007), and aquifers in these regions, such as the southwestern USA, can be stressed because of high groundwater withdrawals (Alcamo et al., 2003a,b). In the southwestern USA, the Southern High Plains aquifer is part of the larger High Plains aquifer system (Fig. 1), which is the principal source for agricultural and drinking water in one of the world\u2019s major agricultural areas. Saltwater intrusion is a growing concern in the southwestern USA aquifers as depletion of freshwater aquifers alters the potentiometric-surface relation- ship with deeper aquifers, which can further induce saltwater intrusion because of increased hydraulic gradients. Various researchers have suggested that regional changes in water compo- sition in the Southern High Plains aquifer are from cross-forma- tional \ufb02ow from underlying aquifers of poorer quality, including saline aquifers (e.g., Nativ, 1992; Dutton, 1987, 1995; McMahon et al., 2007). Variable hydrochemical facies in the Southern High Plains appear to correlate with changes in geology and potentio- metric surfaces (e.g., Nativ, 1992; Dutton, 1987, 1995; McMahon et al., 2007). The effect of cross-formational \ufb02ow between aquifers has not been clearly identi\ufb01ed because of the variability of the tra- ditional geochemical tracers such as major ions and the isotopic composition of water (Nativ, 1992; Dutton, 1995), although Mehta et al. (2000) did use major ions and the isotopic composition of water to discriminate a likely salt in\ufb02uence from an evaporite unit 0883-2927/$ - see front matter \u0002 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The large concentration and isotopic ranges of traditional geochemical tracers make it dif\ufb01cult to explain the source of water in the deeper aquifers, resolve the interaction between the South- ern High Plains aquifer and underlying aquifers, and to identify the alteration of source waters from natural or anthropogenic in\ufb02u- ences. It is necessary to understand the relationships between aquifers in arid and semi-arid regions such as the High Plains to identify or predict possible water-quality changes from natural in\ufb02uences such as drought and saltwater intrusion or anthropo- genic in\ufb02uences such as increased groundwater withdrawals and agricultural recharge. A multi-isotope (dD, d18O, 87Sr/86Sr, and d11B) approach is used to resolve the geochemical evolution of groundwater in a semi-arid region aquifer of the southwestern USA (Southern High Plains aquifer along the Western Caprock Escarpment, Fig. 1) as ground- water reacts to source-water mixing including possible saltwater intrusion, water\u2013rock interaction, and likely agricultural recharge. This multi-isotope approach is necessary to resolve outstanding source-water and mixing issues, particularly in an area where pos- sible \ufb02owpaths from deeper aquifers are more likely because of landform subsidence from salt dissolution. Major ion concentra- tions are examined along with the isotopic composition of water (dD and d18O) to identify possible source waters and hydrochemi- cal-facies changes related to these sources. Strontium concentra- tions and the isotope ratio of radiogenic 87Sr and stable 86Sr (87Sr/86Sr) were used to identify chemical-weathering inputs from water\u2013rock interaction and further constrain likely source waters. Boron concentrations and its stable isotope ratio (11B/10B as d11B) were coupled with Sr to re\ufb01ne the in\ufb02uence of water\u2013rock interac- tion. Additionally, 87Sr/86Sr and d11B were used to evaluate the likely in\ufb02uence of agricultural recharge and how dD and d18O val- ues can be reinterpreted, which may explain part of the wide range of dD and d18O values that have been presented by Nativ (1992) and Dutton (1995) for the Southern High Plains. The study site (Fig. 2) was chosen because of the limited groundwater use in the area and previously identi\ufb01ed spatial dif- ferences in hydrochemical facies that indicate possible saltwater intrusion and variable source-water contributions across the study site (Langman et al., 2004). A small part of the site has been ac- tively used by the US Air Force (Fig. 3) for non-live-\ufb01re training since the 1960s. Groundwater use at the site is limited to reduce human activity and has helped to preserve natural \ufb02ow patterns that can be highly altered in the Southern High Plains aquifer be- cause of large anthropogenic withdrawals (Langman et al., 2006; McMahon and B\u00f6hlke, 2007).

Geologic and hydrologic setting The study site is located along the boundary of two related Pre- cambrian basement-rock basins\u2014Tucumcari and Palo Duro (Gus- tavson, 1996). Marine carbonates were deposited in these basins during the Mississippian followed by clastic sediments during the Pennsylvanian and early Permian (Gustavson and Finley, 1985). A shallow seaway extended into west Texas and eastern New Mexico during the late Permian that produced halite, anhy- drite, dolomite, limestone and clay-dominated sediments that be- come the Permian-bedded salts (Dutton et al., 1979; Gustavson et al., 1980; Johns, 1989; Baker and Leonard, 1995). The shale- dominated Dockum Group was deposited upon the Permian salts during the Triassic when \ufb02uvial, deltaic, and lacustrine environ- ments were present (Dubiel, 1989). The Laramide Orogeny resulted in the uplift of the southern Rocky Mountains, eastward tilting of strata, receding of the Cretaceous seas, and development of south- easterly-\ufb02owing drainage systems that heavily eroded exposed strata including the Dockum Group shales (Brand, 1952; Walker, 1978). Erosion of Jurassic, Cretaceous, and Paleogene deposits from river systems allowed the deposition of the Neogene Ogallala For- mation (alluvial sediments derived from the tectonically-active Southern Rocky Mountains) atop the eroded Dockum Group in the region (Gustavson et al., 1980; Knowles et al., 1984). Such paleodrainage systems were cutoff when subsidence from Perm- ian-salt dissolution (Fig. 2) formed the table-like structure of the Southern High Plains and the surrounding basins of the Pecos and Canadian rivers (Gustavson et al., 1980; Seni, 1980; Simpkins et al., 1981; Gustavson and Finley, 1985; Gustavson, 1986; Dutton, 1987; Senger and Fogg, 1987; Senger et al., 1987). The Blackwater Draw Formation is the primary surface deposit of most of the Southern High Plains and is composed of aggradational sequences of eolian sand, silt and clay derived from reworked Ogallala Forma- tion and Dockum Group deposits (Holliday, 1990). Caliche is typi- cally present in the unsaturated zone of the Blackwater Draw or Ogallala formations in eastern New Mexico (Hart and McAda, 1985), and caliche was found to be laterally discontinuous, of var- iable thickness, and typically found within 15 m of the surface at the study site. A 1-m thick outcrop of caliche is present near the surface of the Mesa and is exposed along the Mesa rim. The Ogallala Formation is the primary matrix of the Southern High Plains aquifer and the underlying Dockum Group shales form the base of the aquifer in the region. Aquifers underlying the Southern High Plains aquifer, including aquifers in the Dockum Fig. 1. High Plains aquifer system and study site location (modi\ufb01ed from McGuire et al. (2003)).

Ellis / Applied Geochemistry 25 (2010) 159\u2013174 Group (upper and lower units) and Permian-bedded salts, have not been as thoroughly investigated and are not currently used as prin- cipal source waters in the Southern High Plains (Bradley and Kala- swad, 2003). The Dockum Group is primarily composed of sandstone and shale (upward \ufb01ning), and its main aquifer is lo- cated in the lower unit that is overlain by the upper Dockum Group shales, although the upper unit does contain smaller, discontinu- ous aquifers (Dutton and Simpkins, 1989; Langman et al., 2004). Upper Dockum Group aquifers are contained within thin sand deposits embedded in shale layers, and the surrounding Dockum Group shale layers are considered impermeable unless fractured (Bradley and Kalaswad, 2003). Groundwater upwelling and \ufb02ow- paths in and from the Permian salts through large thicknesses of Dockum Group shales is poorly understood and likely complex (Dutton, 1989), but high Cl\u0002 concentrations in the Pecos and Cana- dian river basins and continued sinkhole formation in the Southern High Plains indicate that salt dissolution and subsidence is likely still active (Simpkins et al., 1981; Gustavson and Finley, 1985). The current view of recharge in the Southern High Plains is that most surface recharge occurs through playa areas and drainage channels and that interplaya areas contribute little recharge (Gus- tavson et al., 1995; Scanlon and Goldsmith, 1997; Scanlon et al., 2003). Distinct hydrochemical facies in the Southern High Plains aquifer have been attributed to recharge by cross-formational \ufb02ow from underlying aquifers (Nativ and Smith, 1987; Nativ, 1992; Mehta et al., 2000; McMahon and B\u00f6hlke, 2007). The source of Doc- kum Group water is likely site speci\ufb01c and has been attributed to recharge at basin-margin outcrops and contributions from overly- ing and underlying formations in addition to water recharged dur- ing previous climates or emplaced during deposition (Dutton, 1995; Bradley and Kalaswad, 2003). Dutton and Simpkins (1989) and Senger et al. (1987) indicated that the location of groundwater divides in the Dockum Group along the Western Caprock Escarp- ment would inhibit any substantial recharge from a Dockum Group aquifer into the Southern High Plains aquifer in this area. Dutton and Simpkins (1989) suggested that the depleted isotopic compo- sition of water in the Dockum Group aquifer re\ufb02ects the in\ufb02uence of Pleistocene climatic variations and the altitude effect of the pre- vious recharge zones of the aquifer in eastern New Mexico. Within the Southern High Plains aquifer at the study site, a sub- aquifer (local \ufb02ow system, wells 8, 14\u201316, Fig. 3) originates along the Western Caprock Escarpment (Langman et al., 2004).

The local \ufb02ow system is the limit of the Southern High Plains aquifer along the Caprock Escarpment, and the local \ufb02ow system can only re- ceive recharge from in\ufb01ltrating precipitation along the escarpment or upwelling of water from deeper aquifers. Groundwater in the lo- cal \ufb02ow system moves northeastward until water in this system merges with the regional aquifer (regional \ufb02ow system, wells 4\u2013 7) that is de\ufb01ned by the paleochannel of the Portales Valley (Fig. 3). The area where the two \ufb02ow systems merge and mix con- tains wells 3, 18, 21, and L6 and is termed the \u2018\u2018mixing zone\u201d for this study and contains land used for agriculture and a stock tank system fed by wells and a distribution system. Study site wells in the upper Dockum Group aquifer exhibit a potentiometric surface greater than the potentiometric surface in all study site wells in the Southern High Plains aquifer, suggesting that upward cross-forma- tional \ufb02ow is possible in the local and regional \ufb02ow systems. Ver- tical hydraulic gradients (from well screen midpoint) at the paired study wells (well nests with one well in the Ogallala Formation and one in the Dockum Group) were \u00020.15 (wells 1/2), \u00020.11 (wells 18/ 20), and \u00020.03 (wells 21/22) indicating a lessening of the vertical gradient moving away from the Mesa. 3. Methods All groundwater data were collected in June 2006 as part of a long-term monitoring project by the US Geological Survey, and the data are available through their National Water Information System website (http://waterdata.usgs.gov/nwis).

The three Dockum Group wells were part of three well nests that paired a shallow Ogallala Formation well with a Dockum Group well at each location (wells 1/2, 18/20, and 21/22). Ground- water samples were collected as 0.45 lm-\ufb01ltered water for analy- sis of all constituents (Table 1). During purging, \ufb01eld values of speci\ufb01c conductance, water temperature, dissolved-O2, and pH were monitored in a \ufb02owthrough chamber and allowed to stabilize prior to sample collection. Sequential replicate samples were col- lected at randomly selected wells to evaluate laboratory precision. Environmental samples were collected for laboratory matrix spike analysis to ascertain matrix interference through standard addi- tions of the analytes. One \ufb01eld-equipment blank was collected to determine the adequacy of cleaning procedures of the portable submersible pump. For comparison of formation geochemical properties with groundwater solute properties, soil/rock samples were collected at six locations at the study site (Fig. 3)\u2014one sample from the uppermost soil layer atop the Mesa (R1) near well 10, one sample of the Mesa caliche (R2), two samples of the upper Ogallala Forma- tion in Sheep Canyon (R3 and R4), one sample of the upper Dockum Group in Sheep Canyon (R5), and one sample of the Blackwater Draw Formation north of the Mesa (R6). Two samples were col- lected from the Ogallala Formation because of variability in the composition of the formation exposure at the Mesa. All soil sam- ples were collected from a horizontal or vertical depth of approxi- mately 0.5\u20131 m into the formation and analyzed by various laboratories for the constituents listed in Table 1. Principal components analysis, PCA (S-PLUS 7.0, Insightful Cor- poration, 2005), was used as a screening tool to quantitatively identify linear combinations of data (mole units) that largely ex- plain groundwater-composition variation amongst the data groups (loading values are presented where appropriate). Ratios of 87Sr/86Sr were measured on a Finnigan Mat 261 thermal ionization mass spectrometer (TIMS). Following puri\ufb01cation through ion exchange, the Sr was mixed with phosphoric acid and loaded on Fig. 3.

Long-term precision is better than 0.00003 (2 sigma, 95% con\ufb01dence level). The 11B/10B ratios were measured by negative TIMS on the same instrument. Suf\ufb01- cient water to supply 2 ng of B was loaded directly onto degassed, zone-re\ufb01ned Re \ufb01laments. The B isotopes were measured as the BO2 species at masses 42 and 43. The long-term 11B/10B ratio for seawater relative to NIST 951 is +39.5\u2030. The typical agreement of replicate analyses of a sample is within 1\u2030. Various rock types develop different 87Sr/86Sr ratios because of the chemical fractionation of Sr and Rb during mineral formation and the in\ufb02uence of mineral age where radiogenic 87Sr increases from the b-decay of 87Rb (Nimz, 1998). Water\u2013rock interaction imparts a 87Sr/86Sr signature on through-\ufb02owing water and pro- vides a useful means of identifying source waters (Stewart et al., 1998; Bullen and Kendall, 1998). With a difference between the 87Sr/86Sr ratio of waters entering an aquifer and that of the aquifer matrix, it is possible to quantitatively assess water\u2013rock interaction and examine groundwater evolution (e.g., Banner et al., 1989, 1994; Johnson and DePaolo, 1994, 1997; Bullen et al., 1996, 1997).

Mass fractionation of Sr isotopes is relatively small compared to traditional isotopic tracers such as C, O and S, and fractionation of Sr isotopes from biogeochemical processes and instrument analysis is corrected for by normalizing to a stan- dard 88Sr/86Sr ratio. With this fractionation removed, the mea- sured 87Sr/86Sr ratio re\ufb02ects only variations derived from the source such as dissolution of Sr-bearing minerals or labile Sr that represents the exchangeable Sr adsorbed to mineral or organic matter surfaces (Capo et al., 1998). A mass balance equation for determining source-water fractions through concentration and isotope values (Eby, 2004) was used to calculate an estimated contribution from chemical weathering and fractional contribu- tion of each source water to the mixture using Sr concentrations and 87Sr/86Sr: RMM \u00bc RAfAA \u00fe RBfBB \u00fe RCfCC \u00fe RDfDD \u00f01\u00de R = isotopic ratio, f = compositional fraction of component, M, A\u2013 D = mixture, source water, or chemical-weathering component, subscript indicates source and capital letter indicates concentration of the component. This type of mass balance inverse calculation can be used for any geochemical tracer but is particularly useful with Sr concentra- tions and isotopic values because of Sr behavior in the natural envi- ronment (Capo et al., 1998). Using Eq. (1), the inverse calculation allows the unmixing of the known Sr signature of the groundwater mixture at each well by varying the possible source fractions of the known Sr signatures of the likely source waters (known concentra- tions and isotopic values). The chemical-weathering component is used to re\ufb01ne the model for a more precise \ufb01t to the mixture re- sults. Microsoft Excel Solver (what-if-analysis tool) was used to perform the source-fraction calculation (precision equal to 0.00001, convergence set at 0.0001). Each component fraction was adjusted along with the chemical-weathering variable that represented the Sr mass and isotopic contribution from water\u2013rock interaction. The chemical-weathering variable represents a bulk estimate of changes to the Sr mass at a particular location in the aquifer because of contributions from dissolution or ion exchange during \ufb02ow through the various lithologies. Solver varied the pos- sible chemical-weathering input and the fractional contribution of each likely source water that had a known Sr signal (concentration and isotopic ratio) to minimize the sum of the square of the resid- uals of the calculated Sr for each well site and the known Sr con- centration and 87Sr/86Sr ratio of the groundwater mixture. The inverse calculation is a best-\ufb01t scenario where likely inputs (source waters and chemical weathering) are varied concurrently to mini- mize the residuals of a solution compared to the actual Sr values from groundwater at a particular location that represents a mix- ture of source waters and water\u2013rock interactions. Likely source waters were chosen from evaluation of all geochemical data and the physical boundaries of the study area. The 87Sr/86Sr ratio is useful for identifying water\u2013rock interac- tions, but there must be a ratio difference between the mineral assemblages of the various lithologies where source waters origi- nate. Much of the sedimentary layers composing the Southern High Plains are non-marine siliclastics that may have similar 87Sr/86Sr ratios. For this reason, d11B values were coupled with 87Sr/86Sr ratios to assist in discriminating water\u2013rock interaction. Boron is highly sensitive to water\u2013rock interaction\u2014groundwater concentrations can span over four orders of magnitude, and d11B can range from \u000230\u2030 to +60\u2030 (Leeman and Sisson, 1996; Palmer and Swihart, 1996). Adsorption of B ions onto solid surfaces such as clays preferentially removes 10B (Lemarchand and Gaillardet, 2006; Palmer et al., 1987). The fractionation of B isotopes due to adsorption is apparent in the enrichment of 11B in seawater (aver- age d11B value of +40\u2030), which is typically 40\u201350\u2030 greater than average continental crust values (Barth, 2000).

Results and discussion Existing studies provide an initial conceptual model of the pos- sible \ufb02owpaths at the study site, and physical boundaries of the study site can be inferred from drilling during well installation and site topography (refer to Fig. 12 for site physical characteris- tics). The presence of groundwater atop the Western Caprock Escarpment (Langman et al., 2004) indicates local recharge along this topographic high (the Mesa). Dissolution of Permian salts has occurred beneath the Southern High Plains and is likely the strongest along the escarpment (Gustavson and Finley, 1985; McGookey et al., 1985). Dissolution and subsidence of the Permian salts has likely fractured the Dockum Group shales (Gustavson et al., 1980; Gustavson and Finley, 1985; Goldstein and Collins, 1984), with the greatest potential for cross-formational \ufb02owpaths in areas of greatest subsidence such as along the Caprock Escarp- ment. Recharge to the Permian salts from overlying groundwaters has likely occurred since emplacement of the salts and causes con- tinued dissolution (Gustavson et al., 1980; Gustavson and Finley, 1985; Gustavson, 1986; Dutton and Simpkins, 1989). 4.1. Groundwater composition Results of all groundwater and rock chemical analyses are pre- sented in Tables 2 and 3. Principal components analysis strongly indicated that Na and Cl are the dominant major ions affecting changes in water type (loading values of \u00020.64 and \u00020.76 of the 1st component)\u2014a mixed cation-HCO\u0002 3 water in the regional \ufb02ow system and atop the Mesa (well 10) and a Na\u2013Cl or Na-mixed anion water in the local \ufb02ow system and in the upper Dockum Group aquifer (Table 2 and Fig. 4). A detectable but more limited SO2\u0002 4 variability identi\ufb01ed by PCA (2nd component variable with a load- ing value smaller than Na and Cl) indicates an additional in\ufb02uence speci\ufb01c to the mixing zone. Mixed cation-mixed anion water or mixed cation-SO2\u0002 4 water is present in the mixing zone. In addition to differences in hydrochemical facies, the local and regional \ufb02ow systems of the Southern High Plains aquifer at the study site have different groundwater temperatures, dissolved-O2 concentrations, and dissolved-solid concentrations (Table 2). Similar groundwater composition in the upper Dockum Group aquifer and the local \ufb02ow system (Na\u2013Cl water type and high TDS) indicates halite dissolu- tion and possible cross-formational \ufb02ow from the Permian salts to the upper Dockum Group aquifer and into the local \ufb02ow system of the Southern High Plains aquifer. The upper Dockum Group aquifer appears to strongly in\ufb02uence local \ufb02ow system groundwa- ter composition, and this in\ufb02uence is diluted in the mixing zone following mixing with the regional \ufb02ow system. The highest dis- solved-solid concentration in the local \ufb02ow system (9500 mg/L) is furthest from the Mesa (well 16), which suggests longer water\u2013rock interaction of source waters reaching this location in either the Ogallala Formation or Dockum Group.

Groundwater in the upper Dockum Group aquifer indicates larger dissolved-solids closer to the Mesa and a possible mixing of additional source waters in the upper Dockum Group aquifer underlying the regional \ufb02ow system (well 22 located under the regional \ufb02ow system of the Southern High Plains aquifer, Fig. 3). The upper Dockum Group aquifer underlying the local \ufb02ow system possibly contains water that has crossed from the Permian salts through the lower Dockum Group shales into the upper conductive layer(s) of the formation, where it was previously thought that water would likely not be present because of the hydrologic divide of the Caprock Escarp- ment (Dutton and Simpkins, 1989). There are no upgradient areas at the study site where water could recharge at the surface and mi- grate downward into the upper Dockum Group aquifer then back into the Southern High Plains aquifer as the local \ufb02ow system is lo- cated at the Western Caprock Escarpment (Fig. 12 for reference) where the Ogallala Formation and Dockum Group have been cutoff from receiving groundwater from the west (Pecos River Basin). The ion exchange pool at any location in a \ufb02owpath exempli\ufb01es water\u2013rock interaction and atmospheric inputs, and ions will ex- change at the mineral surfaces that re\ufb02ect clay mineralogy, water pH, and water chemistry (Bullen and Kendall, 1998). Excess Na (>1 M ratio of Na and Cl, ratio presented in Table 2 and shown in Fig. 5) is greatest in the regional \ufb02ow system and is smaller in the mixing zone, local \ufb02ow system, and is only present in well Table 3 Chemical analyses of acid digestion and leachate of soil/rock samples collected at the study site, December 2006.

The excess Na in the regional \ufb02ow system corresponds to the weathering of silicates that comprise the Ogallala Formation. In the local \ufb02ow system, the Na/Cl ratio de- creases with distance from the escarpment (wells 8\u201314/15\u201316), and this ratio is highly variable in the upper Dockum Group aqui- fer. The alteration of the Na/Cl ratio in the local \ufb02ow system and the upper Dockum Group aquifer is likely an effect of the Dockum Group shales acting as a geochemical membrane with certain ions, including Na, preferentially adsorbing or exchanging with other ions on clay surfaces. This is typical of halite-in\ufb02uenced saltwater where Na is lost and K, Mg and Ca are gained from water\u2013rock interaction (Kharaka and Hanor, 2004). 4.2. Water stable isotopes, recharge, and mixing The isotopic composition of groundwater in the Southern High Plains has been shown to be highly variable (Fig. 6), and a number of hypotheses have been suggested concerning this variability, including an altitude effect and recharge prior to initiation of the hydrologic divide of the Caprock Escarpment (Dutton and Simp- kins, 1989) and climate variability and cross-formational \ufb02ow (Na- Fig. 5.

Ellis / Applied Geochemistry 25 (2010) 159\u2013174 tiv, 1988, 1992; Dutton, 1995). Previous investigators have noted this large variability and indicated that additional research was necessary to explain the isotopic composition of paleorecharge (Dutton, 1995). Historically, dD and d18O values in precipitation across the Southern High Plains have ranged from \u0002162\u2030 to +35\u2030 for dD and \u000222.7\u2030 to \u00024.7\u2030 for d18O with mean annual weighted values of \u000248\u2030 for dD and \u00027.5\u2030 for d18O (Nativ and Riggio, 1989). Precipitation dD and d18O values for the Southern High Plains aquifer generally plot along the global meteoric water line, but the overall trend has a reduced slope because of the semi- arid climate (Nativ and Riggio, 1989). Dockum Group water dD and d18O typically are 15\u201325\u2030 and 2\u20133\u2030 lighter than Ogallala Forma- tion water, respectively (Dutton and Simpkins, 1986, 1989; Dutton, 1995). The dD and d18O values for the local \ufb02ow system (\u000271.74\u2030 to \u000247.96\u2030 and \u00029.95\u2030 to \u00026.52\u2030, respectively) and upper Doc- kum Group aquifer (\u000267.20\u2030 to \u000251.70\u2030 and \u00029.11\u2030 to \u00026.93\u2030) were more depleted and more variable compared to the regional \ufb02ow system (\u000245.97\u2030 to \u000243.29\u2030 and \u00026.30\u2030 to \u00026.09\u2030).

The larger range of dD and d18O values for the regional data compared to this study\u2019s data re\ufb02ects the wider variability in re- charge for the entire Southern High Plains aquifer. Mixing-zone values (\u000245.19\u2030 to \u000243.90\u2030 and \u00026.14\u2030 to \u00025.85\u2030) are very similar to regional \ufb02ow system values and indicate the presence of no local \ufb02ow system water. Given that the local \ufb02ow system must mix with the regional \ufb02ow system (potentiometric surface indicates the mixing zone is the mixing area), the mixing-zone water should proportionally represent this mixture. This lack of lo- cal \ufb02ow system signal in the mixing zone suggests an additional water source or modi\ufb01cation to groundwater in the mixing zone. A possible additional source water could be agricultural recharge (irrigation and stock tank use) where additional evaporation would decrease dD and d18O values compared to the original groundwater source and all mixing-zone wells are downgradient or adjacent to active or recently active agricultural areas (Fig. 3). The lighter values for water in the local \ufb02ow system and the upper Dockum Group aquifer suggest recharge during a cooler cli- mate that corresponds to the theory of recharge during the last gla- cial period (Dutton, 1995). Given a general increase in dD and d18O values of 5.6\u2030 and 0.7\u2030, respectively, with a 1 \u0003C increase in tem- perature (Dansgaard, 1964), the expected recharge temperature of the likely Permian-bed saltwater in well 8 (most depleted values) compared to the regional \ufb02ow system groundwater would be about 5 \u0003C cooler, which corresponds to recharge temperatures during the last glacial maximum (Stute et al., 1992). A substantial contribution of young, local recharge was not expected at well 8 gi- ven the lack of concentrated surface runoff in the area (necessary for recharge in this climate), and signi\ufb01cant drawdown in this well during pumping with a very slow recovery (days to weeks) that suggests cross-formational \ufb02ow is the dominant water source. Groundwater from the remaining local \ufb02ow system wells indicates more tortuous and longer pathways (larger dissolved-solid concen- trations) and mixing with local recharge (larger dD and d18O val- ues) that is likely represented by groundwater from well 10 atop the Mesa (recent recharge). The substantial variation in the Dockum Group dD and d18O val- ues suggests mixing with local or regional Ogallala Formation water that was not indicated by the groundwater composition, ex- cept for the regional Dockum Group water in\ufb02uence at well 22. Physically, the possible mixing with Ogallala Formation water in the local, upper Dockum Group aquifer is unlikely because of the formation elevations, gradients, and the potentiometric surfaces that would suggest an opposing \ufb02owpath. Given the physical parameters and groundwater composition and range of dD and d18O values in the upper Dockum Group aquifer, the variation of the isotopic values in the upper Dockum Group aquifer may be a result of various sources that compose the Permian-bed saltwater (likely Pecos River Basin water) or climate instability during the last Pleistocene glaciation that has been inferred from analysis of Antarctica ice sheet cores (Dansgaard et al., 1993; Blunier and Brook, 2001; Brook et al., 2005). Both of these suggestions do not correlate with previous conclusions by Dutton and Simpkins (1989) and Dutton (1995) who suggested that the variability of Dockum Group dD and d18O values was a result of mixing with younger recharge from the Ogallala Formation in the Southern High Plains. Dutton and Simpkins (1989) and Dutton\u2019s (1995) con- clusion likely is valid in locations where potentiometric surfaces would promote downward leakage into the Dockum Group, but re- sults of the present study indicate that upward leakage from the Permian salts must also be considered as an in\ufb02uence on Dockum Group and Ogallala Formation water. Such a situation should be particularly considered in areas of landform subsidence where salt dissolution is strongest, and subsidence may provide pathways through con\ufb01ning Dockum Group shales for deeper aquifers to pro- vide cross-formational \ufb02ow where vertical hydraulic gradients would allow such movement. Overall, the wide variability in dD and d18O values makes it dif\ufb01cult to interpret hydrologic pathways by examining the isotopic composition of water with the major ions. 4.3. 87Sr/86Sr, source waters, and chemical weathering Constraining the possible 87Sr/86Sr ratios in groundwater in the upper Dockum Group aquifer and Southern High Plains aquifer are 87Sr/86Sr ratios from the available Sr pools of each aquifer matrix. The 87Sr/86Sr ratios for soil/rock samples collected from the Ogall- ala Formation and Dockum Group were generally larger than groundwater ratios and ranged from 0.70887 to 0.70930 (Table 3). Strontium in leachate from the soil/rock samples likely represents predominantly adsorbed Sr (labile Sr) and not mineral-lattice Sr because of the short leachate period (24 h shaking). The largest 87Sr/86Sr ratio was from the upper Ogallala Formation sample (0.70930), and the smallest ratio was from the Blackwater Draw Formation sample (0.70867). Available Sr increased (increased concentrations in leachate) with sample depth in the Ogallala For- mation and from the Blackwater Draw Formation to the Ogallala Formation to the Dockum Group (largest leachate concentration besides the caliche) (Table 3). The larger Sr concentration in the Dockum Group compared to the Ogallala Formation suggests more available Sr that is likely adsorbed to the prevalent shales of this formation. The range of 87Sr/86Sr ratios (0.70845\u20130.70906) in groundwater at the study site was relatively small (Table 2 and Fig. 7), but the precision of 87Sr/86Sr"

The range of 87Sr/86Sr ratios (0.70845\u20130.70906) in groundwater at the study site was relatively small (Table 2 and Fig. 7), but the precision of 87Sr/86Sr analysis and large range of Sr concentrations (0.90\u201331 mg/L) were suf\ufb01cient to allow discrimination of the geo- chemical in\ufb02uences. The typical 87Sr/86Sr ratio in precipitation is similar to modern seawater (about 0.709) but can be in\ufb02uenced by local or regional dust derived from exposed soils and sediments (Capo et al., 1998). Recharge atop the Caprock Escarpment (well 10) should be the youngest and shallowest water sampled and should re\ufb02ect mostly precipitation and soil Sr inputs without con- tributions from cross-formational \ufb02ow or interaction with deeper formations (refer to Fig. 12 for physical characteristics of the study site). Groundwater in well 10 contained a 87Sr/86Sr ratio of 0.70883, which is near the likely precipitation value but closer to the Mesa soil ratio (87Sr/86Sr of 0.70882). Weathering Precambrian granites, or general continental crust, and associated alluvial sediments gen- erally have a 87Sr/86Sr ratio equal to or greater than 0.71 (Goldstein J.B. Langman, A.S. Ellis / Applied Geochemistry 25 (2010) 159\u2013174 167 and Jacobsen, 1988), and younger granites or alluviums may have smaller ratios because of less radiogenic 87Sr (Capo et al., 1998). Groundwater in the regional \ufb02ow system in the mixed alluvium of the Ogallala Formation had a fairly uniform 87Sr/86Sr ratio (\u00040.70905) and contained the largest ratios in groundwater at the study site (Fig. 7). Burke et al. (1982), Hess et al. (1986), and Brookins (1988) described 87Sr/86Sr variation during the Phanero- zoic and indicated that Permian or Cretaceous marine carbonates and evaporites and derived sediments should have a 87Sr/86Sr range of 0.7068\u20130.7084. Only groundwater from well 8 (well clos- est to the Mesa) had a 87Sr/86Sr ratio near this range (0.70845), and this water is likely representative of Permian-bed saltwater, which was also indicated by major ion and dD and d18O values (Section 4.2). From the above evaluation of the groundwater geochemical re- sults, source waters in the area were determined to be represented by local precipitation and recent recharge (well 10 atop the Cap- rock Escarpment in the upper local \ufb02ow system), regional ground- water from the NW (wells 4\u20136), and likely Permian-bedded salt formation water that has relatively quickly passed through the Dockum Group shales (well 8) where subsidence and shale fractur- ing is likely the greatest (along the Caprock Escarpment, which provides pathways for upwelling water). Using the Sr concentra- tions, 87Sr/86Sr ratios, and Eq. (1), these source waters were used in combination to determine source-water fractions (chemical con- tributions from those sources) for the local \ufb02ow system (source waters represented by well 10 and well 8) where only local re- charge (well 10 signal) and cross-formational \ufb02ow (well 8 signal) can contribute because of higher elevations along the escarpment. Source-water fractions were also determined for the mixing zone where local recharge (well 10), cross-formational \ufb02ow (well 8), and regional groundwater (wells 4\u20136) can mix. An additional var- iable (chemical weathering) was included to provide a bulk esti- mator of water\u2013rock interactions that indicates Sr inputs to the local \ufb02ow system and mixing-zone groundwater from chemical reactions. Inverse calculations of Sr results to estimate source water and chemical-weathering contributions (Fig. 8) indicate that relatively low 87Sr/86Sr ratio, Permian-bed saltwater is in\ufb02uential in the local, upper Dockum Group aquifer and local \ufb02ow system of the South- ern High Plains aquifer. The 87Sr/86Sr ratios calculated for chemical weathering for the upper Dockum Group aquifer and the local \ufb02ow system are greater than 87Sr/86Sr ratios determined from rock sam- ples collected from the Ogallala Formation and Dockum Group (Ta- bles 2 and 3). The higher calculated values likely re\ufb02ect the contribution of mineral-lattice Sr to the available Sr pool because the rock-sample values mostly represent labile Sr (short leachate period). Given that calculated 87Sr/86Sr ratios are not substantially higher than the rock-sample values and not closer to typical igne- ous values of >0.71 as described by Goldstein and Jacobsen (1988) suggests labile Sr is likely the major contributor to the increasing Sr concentrations in the local \ufb02ow system and upper Dockum Group aquifer with longer water\u2013rock interaction. Higher 87Sr/86Sr ratios were calculated for the chemical-weathering contributions in the mixing zone compared to the upper Dockum Group aquifer and the local \ufb02ow system. These higher values suggest a greater weathering of silicate Sr-bearing minerals. It is possible that some of this Sr is a result of fertilizer application but such a contribution would be dif\ufb01cult to quantify given the variability of Sr concentra- tions and 87Sr/86Sr ratios in fertilizers, although 87Sr/86Sr ratios in fertilizer tend to be more radiogenic (B\u00f6hlke and Horan, 2000; Widory et al., 2004). The larger Sr mass and higher 87Sr/86Sr ratio from chemical weathering in the upper Dockum Group aquifer (Fig. 8) is a result of the weathering of siliclastic Sr-bearing minerals and desorption of labile Sr during the longer interval of water\u2013rock interaction (indicated by larger dissolved-solid concentrations). The local \ufb02ow system receives Permian-bed/Dockum Group saltwater and local recharge near the escarpment where the chemical-weathering contribution is smaller but increases with distance from the Mesa. The tortuous \ufb02owpaths in the upper Dockum Group aquifer cause a variable in\ufb02uence on the local \ufb02ow system depending on the per- centage contribution from the Dockum Group and how long Perm- ian-bed saltwater travels through the Dockum Group shales.

The Dockum Group Sr pool is isotopically similar to the Ogallala Formation Sr pool as 87Sr/86Sr ratios increase with greater in\ufb02uence from the Dockum Group and values approach those seen with the regional \ufb02ow system (Fig. 7).

Boron concentrations in groundwater at the study site ranged from 59 mg/L to 1740 mg/L, and d11B values ranged from +6.0\u2030 to +46.0\u2030. These values gener- ally \ufb01t the range of d11B values and Cl/B ratios found in previous studies (Fig. 9). Similar d11B values for Sheep Canyon caliche and young, local recharge (well 10) suggest a precipitation/soil signal near +15\u2030 (Tables 2 and 3). Regional \ufb02ow system d11B values near +15\u2030 indicate a dominant precipitation/soil signal without substantial alteration from water\u2013rock interaction in the Ogallala Formation. The largest d11B values are in the local \ufb02ow system and upper Dockum Group aquifer where groundwater is in\ufb02uenced by the Permian-bed saltwater and has had long interaction with the Dockum Group shales where mass fractionation from adsorp- tion is likely. Closer examination of B concentrations and d11B values at the study site indicates an adsorption effect in the local \ufb02ow system with distance from the Mesa and dilution of the Permian-bed/ Fig. 8.

Additionally, the possible agricultural re- charge in\ufb02uence in the mixing zone (suggested by dD, d18O, and 87Sr/86Sr values) appears to be indicated in the B results. The d11B values in the mixing zone decrease to the lowest groundwater val- ues determined at the study site and are similar to the d11B values for the leachate from the Ogallala Formation and Dockum Group rock samples (Fig. 10). The decrease in d11B values suggests an in- creased contribution from weathering of silicate rocks, but the lar- ger than expected decrease in concentrations suggest a loss of B in the mixing zone. Such an opposing effect could be explained by loss through plant uptake (concentration loss) and a subsequent weathering contribution (lower d11B), likely in the vadose zone during downward migration of agricultural recharge. Anthropo- genic indicators such as pesticides have not been detected in mix- ing-zone wells except for one possible detection (estimated value) of dichlorvos (pesticide) at well 3 during US Geological Survey groundwater monitoring at the study site from 2002 to 2007. Although, NO\u0002 3 concentrations may support the conclusion of agri- cultural recharge in the mixing zone. Overall, NO\u0002 3 concentrations are smaller in the mixing-zone wells compared to the local and re- gional \ufb02ow system wells that are likely outside the in\ufb02uence of agricultural recharge, but the mixing-zone values should be equivalent to a mixing of the local and regional \ufb02ow systems.

Ellis / Applied Geochemistry 25 (2010) 159\u2013174 The smaller NO\u0002 3 concentrations in the mixing zone could indicate the uptake of NO\u0002 3 for plant use from the groundwater used as irri- gation or consumption in stock tanks (algae was commonly ob- served in all stock tanks) prior to leakage from the tank and subsequent recharge to the aquifer similar to the loss of B. Overall, an additional water source or modi\ufb01cation to the groundwater in the mixing zone is necessary to explain the small increase in B con- centration and relatively large decrease in d11B values. Simple mass balance calculations indicate that the B contribution from mineral dissolution cannot explain the mixing-zone groundwater B signal. 4.5. Possible agricultural in\ufb02uence and groundwater geochemistry Boron is considered an essential plant micro-nutrient (Gupta, 1993) and is necessary for optimal growth and yield of cotton (Zhao and Oosterhuis, 2002) and grain (Shorrocks, 1997), both common crops in the study site region. Plants respond directly to the activity of B in soil solution and only indirectly to B adsorbed on soil constit- uents (Goldberg, 1997), indicating stronger uptake of B from solu- tion than at the porewater\u2013sorption surface interface. Fertilizer B (borate) isotope analysis has indicated d11B values of about \u000215\u2030 to +10\u2030 (Vengosh et al., 1994; Komor, 1997; Leenhouts et al., 1998; Zhang et al., 2006). The current understanding of B as a plant nutrient and its uptake in soil suggests that the presence of B in the mixing-zone groundwater applied as irrigation could result in the preferential uptake of solution B and the later advection of soil or fertilizer B into the soil pro\ufb01le and possible return to the underlying aquifer.

With the removal of the heavier B isotope signature in the irrigation water (mixing-zone groundwater) by plant uptake and the entrainment of lighter B isotopes from possible fertilizer sources and soil and vadose zone weathering, the d11B values of the local recharge to groundwater at and downgradient of agricul- tural areas could be lighter than other groundwater mixtures but also possibly contains a larger B concentration than the regional \ufb02ow system because of fertilizer/soil B or additional weathering in the vadose zone (Fig. 10). This scenario could explain the de- crease in 11B when B concentrations increase in the mixing zone, which cannot be explained solely by increased weathering of the clastic sediments of the Ogallala Formation or the Dockum Group. Groundwater dD and d18O values in the mixing zone were hea- vier than expected and did not indicate the presence of local \ufb02ow system water mixing with the regional \ufb02ow system water. Given the mixing of the local and regional \ufb02ow systems, dD and d18O val- ues in the mixing zone should have plotted between values for these two systems (closer to the regional values because of its dominance in the area), but the values were incrementally heavier than dD and d18O values in the regional \ufb02ow system values and indicated no local recharge coming from the Mesa. Evaporation from application of the mixing-zone water to crops in this area or evaporation from stock tanks and subsequent recharge of this water to the aquifer would increase both dD and d18O values in mixing-zone groundwater and could explain the alteration of the B signal. By using the source-water fractional components from the Sr inverse calculations, it is possible to reinterpret the mixing zone dD and d18O values by estimating the mixing-zone groundwa- ter isotopic signature prior to evaporation from possible agricul- tural use (Fig. 11). The dD and d18O values of the possible source waters (local \ufb02ow, regional \ufb02ow, and Permian-bed saltwater) were mixed according to the Sr fractional results (chemical-weathering component was distributed proportionally). The calculated dD and d18O values provide a logical \ufb01t to the mixing model and sub- stantiate the assertion that mixing-zone water has likely under- gone additional evaporation, which is indicative of possible agricultural recharge. Agricultural recharge could explain some of the large variability of dD and d18O values found in Southern High Plains groundwater, both in the Ogallala Formation and Dockum Group. 5. Conclusions This study\u2019s results describe the geochemical evolution of groundwater in the western Southern High Plains as saltwater from the Permian-bedded salts crossing into the Dockum Group shales and intruding into the siliclastic alluvium of the Ogallala Formation (Fig. 12). Source waters that compose the Permian- bed saltwater likely originate in the Pecos River Basin and cross be- neath or through the hydrologic divide of the Western Caprock Fig. 11.

Cross-formational \ufb02ow from the Permian-bedded salts into the Dockum Group provides a water source where it was suggested that a source likely did not exist because of the hydrologic divide of the escarpment (Dutton and Simpkins, 1989). Longer residence of the Permian-bed saltwater in the Dockum Group prior to entering the Southern High Plains aquifer alters the Permian-salt signal through chemical weathering that contributes solutes and ex- change/adsorption that changes solute ratios. Local water of the Southern High Plains aquifer \ufb02ows away from the Western Cap- rock Escarpment and mixes with the upwelling saltwater and eventually mixes with the regional aquifer, but local water contri- butions are variable by location because of structural highs in the Dockum Group/Ogallala Formation contact that shape local \ufb02owpaths. The effectiveness of 87Sr/86Sr and d11B at resolving the geo- chemical in\ufb02uences in groundwater in the Southern High Plains along the Western Caprock Escarpment allowed for the reinterpre- tation of the isotopic composition of water that has been shown to be highly variable in the Southern High Plains. The 87Sr/86Sr ratio does not appear to be signi\ufb01cantly affected by possible agricultural recharge, but its utility is minimized by the limited difference in 87Sr/86Sr ratios derived from silicates that compose the major for- mations in the Southern High Plains. The d11B values were useful for identifying both natural and anthropogenic effects because of the large d11B range and the adsorption of B with \ufb02ow through the Dockum Group shales and likely uptake of B by \ufb01eld crops. Overall, coupling of multiple tracers, both traditional and nontradi- tional, was necessary to identify natural and anthropogenic pro- cesses that in\ufb02uence the groundwater geochemical evolution in the Southern High Plains aquifer. This study shows the utility of a multi-isotope approach for resolving the geochemical evolution of groundwater in an aquifer system that has a complex relationship with underlying aquifers and also the applicability of these isotopes as indicators of the alteration of source waters from natural or anthropogenic in\ufb02u- ences. Cross-formational \ufb02ow between aquifers can be dif\ufb01cult to ascertain with traditional geochemical tracers, and the coupling of multiple tracer concentrations and isotopes allows the identi\ufb01- cation of more geochemical processes that in\ufb02uence the composi- tion of groundwater in multiple source-water aquifers. Understanding the relationship between aquifers is necessary to determine source-water effects, particularly in arid and semi-arid regions, where the potentiometric\u2013surface relationship is being al- tered because of large groundwater withdrawals.

        "Text": "location because of structural highs in the Dockum Group/Ogallala Formation contact that shape local \ufb02owpaths. The effectiveness of 87Sr/86Sr and d11B at resolving the geo- chemical in\ufb02uences in groundwater in the Southern High Plains along the Western Caprock Escarpment allowed for the reinterpre- tation of the isotopic composition of water that has been shown to be highly variable in the Southern High Plains. The 87Sr/86Sr ratio does not appear to be signi\ufb01cantly affected by possible agricultural recharge, but its utility is minimized by the limited difference in 87Sr/86Sr ratios derived from silicates that compose the major for- mations in the Southern High Plains. The d11B values were useful for identifying both natural and anthropogenic effects because of the large d11B range and the adsorption of B with \ufb02ow through the Dockum Group shales and likely uptake of B by \ufb01eld crops. Overall, coupling of multiple tracers, both traditional and nontradi- tional, was necessary to identify natural and anthropogenic pro- cesses that in\ufb02uence the groundwater geochemical evolution in the Southern High Plains aquifer. This study shows the utility of a multi-isotope approach for resolving the geochemical evolution of groundwater in an aquifer system that has a complex relationship with underlying aquifers and also the applicability of these isotopes as indicators of the alteration of source waters from natural or anthropogenic in\ufb02u- ences. Cross-formational \ufb02ow between aquifers can be dif\ufb01cult to ascertain with traditional geochemical tracers, and the coupling of multiple tracer concentrations and isotopes allows the identi\ufb01- cation of more geochemical processes that in\ufb02uence the composi- tion of groundwater in multiple source-water aquifers. Understanding the relationship between aquifers is necessary to determine source-water effects, particularly in arid and semi-arid regions, where the potentiometric\u2013surface relationship is being al- tered because of large groundwater withdrawals. Information pre- sented in this study represents a base for future hydrogeological work that will assist in the protection of the water resources of the Southern High Plains in areas where cross-formational \ufb02ow is strong because of subsidence from salt dissolution.
