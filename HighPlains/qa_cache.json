  "Did the study define the aquifer extent in 2D?|||Yes. The text and figures (particularly Figure 1) indicate the authors defined a spatial (2D) \u201cmodel domain\u201d for the aquifer that extends into parts of Kansas and Colorado to minimize boundary effects.": "yes",
  "Did the study define the aquifer extent in 2D?|||Yes. The text indicates that the study shows the \"boundaries of the relevant aquifers\" in Figure 2.0.2 and the \u201clocation of the active model area\u201d in Figure 2.0.1, effectively defining the aquifer extents in a two-dimensional framework.": "yes",
  "Did the study define the aquifer extent in 2D?|||Yes. They mapped and bounded the aquifer across its areal extent (the \u201cmodel perimeter\u201d), using natural or hydrologic boundaries and GIS tools (e.g., TIN surfaces), thereby defining a two-dimensional outline of the Ogallala\u2019s footprint for the study.": "yes",

  "Did the study define the aquifer extent in 2D?|||Yes. The study uses previous USGS work to delineate the aquifer\u2019s horizontal boundaries across roughly 29,000 square miles, effectively defining its extent in a two-dimensional sense.": "yes",
  "Did the study define the aquifer extent in 2D?|||Yes. The report includes maps (for example, figure\u202f1) showing where the Southern High Plains aquifer spans the Cannon AFB area in plan view, effectively defining the aquifer\u2019s extent in two dimensions.": "yes",
  "Did the study define the aquifer extent in 2D?|||Yes. The report references Figure 1 (\u201cHigh Plains aquifer system and study site location\u201d), which is a map showing the areal (2D) extent of the aquifer and the study location.": "yes",
  "Did the study define the aquifer extent in 2D?|||Yes. The study includes maps showing the aquifer boundary, bedrock surface contours, and thickness (Figures 4 and 5), thereby depicting the aquifer extent in a two-dimensional sense.": "yes",
  "Did the study define the aquifer extent in 2D?|||From the information provided, the study does not present a single, explicit 2D boundary polygon for the aquifer. Instead, it \u201cdefines\u201d the aquifer in two dimensions by using the remapped base (redbed) and water\u2010level surfaces to calculate saturated thickness over the study area (i.e., wherever the difference between these surfaces indicates saturation). Although areas of known \u201cdiscontinuous saturation\u201d from previous work were once excluded, this study\u2019s remapping effectively encompasses a broader zone, but it does not specify a single outlined 2D boundary.": "no",
  "Did the study define the aquifer extent in 2D?|||Yes. The report specifies that wells located outside the \u201cextent of the High Plains aquifer as defined by Hart and McAda (1985)\u201d were removed, indicating a 2D boundary was used to define the aquifer extent.": "yes",
  "Did the study define the aquifer extent in 2D?|||Yes. The study displays the aquifer boundary as a polygon layer on maps (Figure 3, referencing USGS data), which indicates that the aquifer extent is defined in a two\u2011dimensional sense.": "yes",
  "Did the study define the base of the aquifer? If yes, what data was used to define the base of the aquifer?|||No. The excerpt does not explicitly define the base of the aquifer nor does it describe what data were used to delineate it. The text only mentions changes in saturated thickness and practical depletion thresholds without discussing how the base itself was determined.": "no",
  "Did the study define the base of the aquifer? If yes, what data was used to define the base of the aquifer?|||Yes. The study used geophysical logs as the primary data source to pick the base of the aquifer and then incorporated supplemental datasets (e.g., studies from High Plains Water District, Hemphill County UWCD, and Daniel B. Stephens and Associates) to refine and interpolate the base, ensuring the final surface honored the original log correlations.": "yes",
  "Did the study define the base of the aquifer? If yes, what data was used to define the base of the aquifer?|||Yes. They used numerous well data to map the base at the contact with underlying \u201cred beds\u201d (Permian and Mesozoic rocks) and employed ArcInfo/ArcView (e.g., TIN surfaces) to model regional trends.": "yes",
  "Did the study define the base of the aquifer? If yes, what data was used to define the base of the aquifer?|||Yes. In the numerical model, layer 3 represents the lower Dockum, and its base is treated as the base of the aquifer. The report indicates that this boundary was defined using the geologic surfaces described in Section 4.2.1 and shown in Figure 4.2.4\u2014essentially mapping the top of the lower Dockum and then assigning the model\u2019s lowest layer boundary accordingly.": "yes",
  "Did the study define the base of the aquifer? If yes, what data was used to define the base of the aquifer?|||The report excerpt does not explicitly state how the base of the aquifer was defined. It references prior regional-scale studies (the USGS RASA Program) that defined the High Plains aquifer boundaries, but it does not detail the specific data or methods used to identify the aquifer\u2019s base in this particular study.": "no",
  "Did the study define the base of the aquifer? If yes, what data was used to define the base of the aquifer?|||No. The report notes that the aquifer overlies the Dockum Group (Chinle Formation) but does not explicitly define or map the aquifer\u2019s base, nor does it specify what data might have been used to delineate that contact.": "no",
  "Did the study define the base of the aquifer? If yes, what data was used to define the base of the aquifer?|||Yes. The study defines the Dockum Group shales as the base of the Southern High Plains aquifer, relying on the regional geologic framework (i.e., known stratigraphic relations between the Ogallala Formation and the underlying Dockum Group) to delineate that boundary.": "yes",
  "Did the study define the base of the aquifer? If yes, what data was used to define the base of the aquifer?|||Yes. They show the base of the aquifer as the bedrock surface beneath the Ogallala Formation. In particular, Figure 4 in the report uses elevations of the bedrock surface (from Hart and McAda, 1985) and thickness data for the Ogallala Formation to define where the High Plains Aquifer ends.": "yes",
  "Did the study define the base of the aquifer? If yes, what data was used to define the base of the aquifer?|||Yes. The study remapped the base of the High Plains aquifer using logs of 369 wells from the New Mexico Office of the State Engineer. In particular, it identified \u201credbeds\u201d in the logs as the base of the Ogallala Formation and used 179 wells with reliable data on redbeds to calculate the elevation of the aquifer base.": "yes",
  "Did the study define the base of the aquifer? If yes, what data was used to define the base of the aquifer?|||Yes. The study used the elevation of the base of the High Plains aquifer from Hart and McAda (1985) to define where the aquifer bottom lies, applying a \u00b125 ft margin to account for the 50\u2010ft contour interval in their map.": "yes",
  "Did the study define the base of the aquifer? If yes, what data was used to define the base of the aquifer?|||No. The passages do not indicate that the study explicitly defined the aquifer\u2019s base. They reference overall aquifer boundaries from USGS data (see https://pubs.usgs.gov/ds/543/), but there is no mention in the text of defining or measuring the aquifer\u2019s base.": "no",
  "Did the study define the hydrostratigraphy of the aquifer? If yes, what data was used to define the hydrostratigraphy?|||No. The excerpts provided do not show that the study explicitly defined the hydrostratigraphy (e.g., geologic layering or aquifer units). They discuss saturated thickness, water-level declines, baseflow separation, and groundwater management but do not outline specific data or methods for characterizing hydrostratigraphy.": "no",
  "Did the study define the hydrostratigraphy of the aquifer? If yes, what data was used to define the hydrostratigraphy?|||Yes. They defined four hydrostratigraphic units using geophysical-log correlations, thickness and distribution data, and regional cross sections. This included examining the stratigraphic relationships of the Dockum Group, Cretaceous/Jurassic formations, and Tertiary/Quaternary deposits to establish the model layers.": "yes",
  "Did the study define the hydrostratigraphy of the aquifer? If yes, what data was used to define the hydrostratigraphy?|||Yes. They note that the Ogallala Formation and its adjacent older and younger units comprise the overall \u201cHigh Plains aquifer.\u201d In defining that hydrostratigraphy, the study used mapped aquifer geometry (top, bottom, and lateral boundaries) and incorporated depositional\u2010system information (such as sand/gravel distributions) and previous work (e.g., Gutentag and others, 1984) to characterize the aquifer\u2019s extent and connectivity.": "yes",
  "Did the study define the hydrostratigraphy of the aquifer? If yes, what data was used to define the hydrostratigraphy?|||Yes. They used previous geologic and hydrologic studies along with structure maps, hydraulic properties, water-level data, and spring and stream flow data (plus climatic information) to characterize and define the Dockum Aquifer\u2019s hydrostratigraphy.": "yes",
  "Did the study define the hydrostratigraphy of the aquifer? If yes, what data was used to define the hydrostratigraphy?|||Yes. The study relies on the USGS Regional Aquifer-System Analysis (RASA) work (Weeks and others, 1988) and the hydrogeologic subdivisions defined by Gutentag and others (1984) to delineate the aquifer\u2019s boundaries and subunits. These earlier studies, which involved mapping the Ogallala Formation and associated deposits, provided the primary data used to describe the hydrostratigraphy.": "yes",
  "Did the study define the hydrostratigraphy of the aquifer? If yes, what data was used to define the hydrostratigraphy?|||Yes. The report identifies the unconfined Southern High Plains aquifer as comprising the top of the Triassic Dockum Group (Chinle Formation), the Tertiary Ogallala Formation, and the Quaternary Blackwater Draw Formation. This characterization relies on earlier published geologic work (for example, Langman and others, 2006; McGowen and others, 1977) and the existing understanding of where each formation lies and how they interact (such as the erosional surface and paleochannels in the Dockum).": "yes",
  "Did the study define the hydrostratigraphy of the aquifer? If yes, what data was used to define the hydrostratigraphy?|||Yes. The paper describes the Ogallala Formation overlying Dockum Group shales as the main aquifer system (with smaller, discontinuous aquifers in the upper Dockum) and discusses underlying Permian salt layers. This stratigraphy is defined using geologic mapping (formation lithologies and thicknesses), well data, and water-chemistry/isotopic analyses (e.g., major ions, Sr and B isotopes) to distinguish and correlate the aquifer units.": "yes",
  "Did the study define the hydrostratigraphy of the aquifer? If yes, what data was used to define the hydrostratigraphy?|||Yes. The report identifies the Ogallala Formation (plus overlying Quaternary deposits) as the main water\u2010bearing unit and shows where it is saturated or unsaturated across Curry and Roosevelt counties. The authors used geologic mapping (New Mexico Bureau of Geology and Mineral Resources, 2003), elevation and thickness data (Figures 3\u20135), and earlier work (e.g., Hart and McAda, 1985; Cronin, 1969) to delineate and characterize the aquifer\u2019s stratigraphy.": "yes",
  "Did the study define the hydrostratigraphy of the aquifer? If yes, what data was used to define the hydrostratigraphy?|||Yes. It distinguishes the High Plains aquifer (Ogallala Formation) from the underlying Triassic \u201credbeds\u201d and uses well logs from the New Mexico Office of the State Engineer (OSE) to define and map the aquifer\u2019s base for the study area.": "yes",
  "Did the study define the hydrostratigraphy of the aquifer? If yes, what data was used to define the hydrostratigraphy?|||Yes. They used the mapped base of the High Plains aquifer from Hart and McAda (1985), along with measured well depths, well\u2010head elevations from a 10\u202fm DEM, and comparisons of total\u2010depth elevations to that mapped aquifer base. This information allowed them to identify which wells were completed within the High Plains aquifer and thus to define its hydrostratigraphic extent for the study.": "yes",
  "Did the study define the hydrostratigraphy of the aquifer? If yes, what data was used to define the hydrostratigraphy?|||No. The excerpt does not indicate that the study explicitly defined the aquifer\u2019s hydrostratigraphy. It only cites USGS data for the aquifer boundary and uses remotely sensed land-cover information; there is no mention of collecting or analyzing geologic or subsurface data layers to characterize hydrostratigraphy.": "no",
  "Did the study define subsurface structural controls on groundwater flow? If yes, what data was used to define the structural controls?|||No. The excerpt does not mention or describe any subsurface structural controls (such as faults or geologic features) on groundwater flow. It focuses mainly on saturated thickness, baseflow separation, and head data from TWDB and USGS, without addressing structural data or methods for defining structural controls.": "no",
  "Did the study define subsurface structural controls on groundwater flow? If yes, what data was used to define the structural controls?|||Yes. The study does outline the subsurface geometry (pinchouts, aquifer tops and bases, etc.) that effectively control groundwater flow. They used geophysical logs (gamma-ray and resistivity), driller\u2019s logs, and mapped outcrop boundaries to define and interpolate these structural surfaces.": "yes",
  "Did the study define subsurface structural controls on groundwater flow? If yes, what data was used to define the structural controls?|||Yes. They used well data (e.g., depths to \u201cred beds\u201d in Permian and Mesozoic rocks) and GIS-based mapping (TIN surfaces in ArcInfo/ArcView) to delineate the aquifer base, which serves as the principal subsurface structural control in their flow model. This defined the underlying boundary and guided how groundwater flow was represented.": "yes",
  "Did the study define subsurface structural controls on groundwater flow? If yes, what data was used to define the structural controls?|||No. The sections provided do not indicate that explicit subsurface structural controls (for example, faults or folds) were defined. They focus on boundary delineation using the aquifer\u2019s extent, outcrops, and top/bottom elevations rather than any structural features. Consequently, no specific data were cited for defining structural controls in this portion of the study.": "no",
  "Did the study define subsurface structural controls on groundwater flow? If yes, what data was used to define the structural controls?|||No. The report does not explicitly define or map any subsurface structural controls on groundwater flow. It discusses aquifer boundaries, hydrogeologic units, and the influence of sediment variability but does not present data specifically identifying structural controls such as faults or folds.": "no",
  "Did the study define subsurface structural controls on groundwater flow? If yes, what data was used to define the structural controls?|||Yes. The study recognizes the contact between the Ogallala Formation and the Dockum Group as the main structural (subsurface) control on groundwater flow. It draws on existing well/drilling logs, previous USGS reports, and published geologic mapping (for example, Dutton and others, 2001) to define that contact, including the identification of erosional paleochannels that serve as preferential flow pathways.": "yes",
  "Did the study define subsurface structural controls on groundwater flow? If yes, what data was used to define the structural controls?|||From the passages provided, the report does recognize that salt\u2010related subsidence and the boundary between the underlying basement basins (Tucumcari and Palo Duro) exert structural influences on groundwater flow. However, the study does not present new, detailed structural mapping. Instead, it infers these subsurface controls primarily by combining existing geologic information (such as the basin boundaries and known salt\u2010dissolution features) with hydrochemical and isotopic data\u2014specifically major\u2010ion concentrations, \u03b4D and \u03b418O values, and strontium and boron isotopes\u2014to identify likely deeper flowpaths and assess upwelling from underlying units.": "no",
  "Did the study define subsurface structural controls on groundwater flow? If yes, what data was used to define the structural controls?|||No. The report does not explicitly identify or describe specific structural (e.g., fault\u2010related) controls on groundwater flow. It does present bedrock elevation, geologic mapping, and Ogallala\u2010thickness data (derived from well records and previous mapping) that could be used to infer possible influences on flow, but it does not formally define subsurface structural controls.": "no",
  "Did the study define subsurface structural controls on groundwater flow? If yes, what data was used to define the structural controls?|||The report does not explicitly refer to \u201csubsurface structural controls\u201d by name. However, it does effectively define the aquifer\u2019s subsurface framework\u2014which strongly influences groundwater flow\u2014by remapping the base of the aquifer (the redbed surface) and the paleochannel axis. These were defined using well data (including Cronin\u2019s 1969 paleochannel mapping and new well-based measurements of the redbed surface). This remapped base and axis serve, in practice, as the structural controls on groundwater flow.": "no",
  "Did the study define subsurface structural controls on groundwater flow? If yes, what data was used to define the structural controls?|||No. The report sections do not describe or map specific subsurface structural features that would control groundwater flow. They rely primarily on existing aquifer extents (from Hart and McAda, 1985), well information, and water-level data rather than new structural analyses.": "no",
  "Did the study define subsurface structural controls on groundwater flow? If yes, what data was used to define the structural controls?|||No. The cited sections do not define or describe subsurface structural controls on groundwater flow. They focus on water availability, land\u2010use decisions, and the Ogallala Aquifer\u2019s overall extent rather than any underlying geologic structures. Therefore, there is no mention of specific data used to define structural controls.": "no",
  "Did the study define recharge and discharge zones? If yes, what data was used to define recharge and discharge zones?|||The report does not explicitly define \u201cdischarge zones,\u201d but it does identify key recharge zones\u2014namely upland areas, playas, and ephemeral/intermittent streambeds. These zones were inferred and characterized using measurements and modeling of infiltration rates (including macropore flow in playas), soil moisture balances, and literature values for percolation beneath stream channels. Data on hydraulic conductivities, sediment deposition, and runoff collection in playas also helped delineate where recharge is most likely to occur.": "no",
  "Did the study define recharge and discharge zones? If yes, what data was used to define recharge and discharge zones?|||From the information provided, the report explicitly identifies aquifer outcrops (Ogallala and Dockum) as the primary recharge zones. These zones were delineated using geologic outcrop mapping, water\u2010level data, and estimates of infiltration from precipitation, irrigation return flow, and playa lakes. The text does not explicitly define or map \u201cdischarge zones,\u201d so it is not clear from the quoted sections how or whether the study designates specific discharge areas.": "no",
  "Did the study define recharge and discharge zones? If yes, what data was used to define recharge and discharge zones?|||The report does not explicitly map or define distinct \u201crecharge zones\u201d or \u201cdischarge zones.\u201d It notes that recharge occurs primarily through downward percolation from the High Plains surface, especially beneath playas, and acknowledges that the distribution of recharge is not well characterized. There is no discussion in the excerpt about identifying or delineating specific discharge zones.": "no",
  "Did the study define recharge and discharge zones? If yes, what data was used to define recharge and discharge zones?|||Yes. The study identifies the outcrop areas (particularly along the Colorado and Canadian Rivers) as the principal recharge zones and notes that groundwater flow discharges toward rivers and streams. To define these zones, the authors relied on water\u2010level trends (including rises in outcrop wells), aquifer flow directions, and outcrop configurations (location/elevation), as well as chloride and total dissolved solids data in wells.": "yes",
  "Did the study define recharge and discharge zones? If yes, what data was used to define recharge and discharge zones?|||No. The text does not explicitly define or map out specific recharge or discharge zones. Although it references \u201crecently recharged\u201d water (less than about 50 years old) based on the presence of pesticides, tritium, or elevated nitrate, it does not establish distinct recharge or discharge areas in the study region.": "no",
  "Did the study define recharge and discharge zones? If yes, what data was used to define recharge and discharge zones?|||No. The report does not explicitly delineate or map distinct recharge and discharge zones. It notes that groundwater\u2010flow directions and hydraulic gradients can be used to understand where pumping (discharge) may be depleting the aquifer and where recharge may occur (for example, through playa lakes), but it does not define formal recharge or discharge zones using specific data.": "no",
  "Did the study define recharge and discharge zones? If yes, what data was used to define recharge and discharge zones?|||From the information provided, the study does not explicitly label particular \u201crecharge zones\u201d or \u201cdischarge zones\u201d by name, but it does point out that (1) most recharge occurs through playas and drainage channels, and (2) a local flow system near the Western Caprock Escarpment marks the limit of the aquifer and effectively serves as a discharge boundary. These inferences come from hydrochemical\u2010facies analysis (major ions) and isotopic data (\u03b4D, \u03b4\u00b9\u2078O, \u2078\u2077Sr/\u2078\u2076Sr, and \u03b4\u00b9\u00b9B), which the authors use to distinguish different source waters and identify where groundwater enters (recharge) and leaves (discharge) the Southern High Plains aquifer.": "no",
  "Did the study define recharge and discharge zones? If yes, what data was used to define recharge and discharge zones?|||No. The excerpt does not explicitly identify or map out distinct recharge and discharge zones. It discusses potential recharge mechanisms (e.g., through dunes, sandsheets, and playa basins) and references various methods (chemical and isotopic data, water-level changes) used in estimating recharge, but it does not delineate actual recharge or discharge \u201czones\u201d in the study area.": "no",
  "Did the study define recharge and discharge zones? If yes, what data was used to define recharge and discharge zones?|||No. The report sections provided do not define recharge or discharge zones, nor do they specify data used to delineate any such zones. The focus is on mapping the aquifer base, water-level elevations, saturated thickness, and assessing associated uncertainties; there is no explicit discussion of identifying recharge or discharge areas.": "no",
  "Did the study define recharge and discharge zones? If yes, what data was used to define recharge and discharge zones?|||The text does not explicitly define or map specific recharge and discharge \u201czones.\u201d Rather, it summarizes the general findings of previous research, indicating that sandsheets, dunes, and especially playa basins are likely areas of significantly higher recharge (based on geologic, hydrologic, and geochemical evidence). There is no corresponding designation in the report for discrete discharge areas.": "no",
  "Did the study define recharge and discharge zones? If yes, what data was used to define recharge and discharge zones?|||No. The study does not explicitly define recharge or discharge zones, nor does it describe specific data used to identify them. The text mentions aquifer boundaries but does not provide details about delineating or analyzing recharge and discharge areas.": "no",
  "Did the study quantify recharge and discharge rates or amounts? If yes, what data was used to quantify recharge and discharge rates or amounts?|||Yes. The report cites earlier modeling and mass\u2010balance studies to quantify recharge rates. For example, Keese et al. (2005) modeled annual diffuse recharge of about 0.4\u20130.8 mm/yr (roughly 0.1% of average rainfall), and Wood and Sandford (1995) used chloride mass\u2010balance methods to estimate about 11 \u00b1 2 mm/yr. These studies relied on precipitation data, soil information, and geochemical (chloride) balances to derive their recharge estimates. Discharge estimates (e.g., baseflows) are mentioned but not explicitly quantified in the excerpts.": "yes",
  "Did the study quantify recharge and discharge rates or amounts? If yes, what data was used to quantify recharge and discharge rates or amounts?|||Yes. Section 4.4 and its references describe how the study quantifies recharge, primarily using existing regional groundwater flow models and groundwater tracer data (see Table 4.4.1). They incorporate sources such as precipitation, irrigation return flow, and leakage from streams, reservoirs, and playa lakes to estimate recharge amounts. While the text does not detail specific discharge figures, the modeling and tracer approaches support both recharge and overall water\u2010budget (inflow/outflow) evaluations.": "yes",
  "Did the study quantify recharge and discharge rates or amounts? If yes, what data was used to quantify recharge and discharge rates or amounts?|||They did provide an approximate range for recharge (0.25\u201315 cm/yr) drawn from Mullican and others (1997), but they did not explicitly quantify overall discharge in this section. The recharge estimates rely on prior studies (e.g., Mullican et al.) rather than on new field measurements presented here.": "no",
  "Did the study quantify recharge and discharge rates or amounts? If yes, what data was used to quantify recharge and discharge rates or amounts?|||Yes. Recharge was primarily quantified using (1) groundwater chloride data (for wells with total dissolved solids under 500 mg/L) to estimate predevelopment recharge and (2) water-level rises in wells (from the TWDB database) to estimate postdevelopment recharge. For example, chloride data suggested about 0.2 inches per year of predevelopment recharge in the Colorado River outcrop area, and water-level rise analyses indicated up to about 2.2 inches per year where the water table had risen significantly. Discharge (\u201crejected recharge\u201d) was discussed conceptually\u2014flow leaving the aquifer through springs, evapotranspiration, or streams\u2014but no explicit rate was numerically quantified.": "yes",
  "Did the study quantify recharge and discharge rates or amounts? If yes, what data was used to quantify recharge and discharge rates or amounts?|||No. The sections provided do not discuss or present any calculations of recharge or discharge amounts, nor do they describe data used specifically for quantifying those rates. The focus is on water-quality sampling procedures and well characteristics rather than on hydrologic modeling of recharge or discharge.": "no",
  "Did the study quantify recharge and discharge rates or amounts? If yes, what data was used to quantify recharge and discharge rates or amounts?|||No. This report does not directly measure or calculate new recharge or discharge rates. It references earlier published recharge estimates (for example, Stone and McGurk, 1985; Mantei and others, 1966\u201367; Musharrafieh and Logan, 1999) but does not include new measurements or specific quantifications of recharge or discharge amounts.": "no",
  "Did the study quantify recharge and discharge rates or amounts? If yes, what data was used to quantify recharge and discharge rates or amounts?|||No. The excerpts describe recharge sources and the influence of various aquifers on water movement, but they do not provide any measured or calculated rates or amounts for recharge or discharge. The discussion focuses on identifying and characterizing the sources of groundwater (e.g., through isotopes and hydrochemical facies) rather than quantifying volumetric recharge or discharge.": "no",
  "Did the study quantify recharge and discharge rates or amounts? If yes, what data was used to quantify recharge and discharge rates or amounts?|||From the text provided, the new study itself does not present a fresh numerical calculation of recharge or discharge rates; rather, it reviews and discusses estimates from earlier investigations. Those previous studies used groundwater\u2010level measurements, chemical and isotopic techniques (such as chloride\u2010mass balance), and analyses of anthropogenic compounds (e.g., pesticides, industrial chemicals) to estimate recharge in Curry and Roosevelt Counties. The cited works include Theis (1937), Havens (1966), Wood and Petraitis (1984), Stone and McGurk (1985), Wood and Sanford (1995), and Scanlon et al. (2012), among others. These prior studies form the basis for the discussion of recharge rates in the new report, but the text does not indicate that the new study made its own direct quantification. Discharge estimates are not explicitly quantified in the excerpt.": "no",
  "Did the study quantify recharge and discharge rates or amounts? If yes, what data was used to quantify recharge and discharge rates or amounts?|||The report sections do not describe any direct calculation or explicit quantification of recharge or discharge rates.

  "Did the study quantify recharge and discharge rates or amounts? If yes, what data was used to quantify recharge and discharge rates or amounts?|||The report does not present its own new numeric estimates of recharge or discharge. It cites previous work (for example, Nativ and Riggio, 1990; Wood and Sanford, 1995) indicating that overall recharge is only a few tenths of an inch per year based on geologic, hydrologic, and geochemical data. There is no direct quantification of discharge rates in the sections provided.": "no",
  "Did the study quantify recharge and discharge rates or amounts? If yes, what data was used to quantify recharge and discharge rates or amounts?|||No. The study discusses groundwater decline and highlights the importance of managed aquifer recharge, but it does not provide or use any specific data quantifying recharge or discharge rates or amounts.": "no",
  "Did the study produce water table elevation, depth to water, piezometric surface, or potentiometric surface maps?|||They do not use the exact phrases \u201cwater table elevation,\u201d \u201cdepth to water,\u201d \u201cpiezometric,\u201d or \u201cpotentiometric surface\u201d in the excerpts. However, they do describe interpolating groundwater hydraulic head data (Figure 5) for pre\u2010development and current conditions, which effectively amounts to creating a mapped representation of the aquifer\u2019s head surface. This implies that they did produce what is functionally a potentiometric (or water\u2010table) map.": "no",
  "Did the study produce water table elevation, depth to water, piezometric surface, or potentiometric surface maps?|||They produced and discussed \u201cestimated water\u2010level surfaces\u201d for both pre\u2010development and later periods, which effectively serve as potentiometric (or water\u2010table) maps, though the report does not explicitly call them \u201cpotentiometric surface maps.\u201d There is no mention of separate \u201cdepth to water\u201d maps in the section provided.": "no",
  "Did the study produce water table elevation, depth to water, piezometric surface, or potentiometric surface maps?|||They produced water-table elevation maps (specifically, \u201ccontours of the simulated water table\" that match the estimated 1950 water table).
