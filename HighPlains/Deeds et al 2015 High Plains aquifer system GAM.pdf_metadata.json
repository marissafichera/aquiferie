The High Plains Aquifer System in Texas consists of the southern and northern portions of the major Ogallala Aquifer and the minor Rita Blanca, Edwards-Trinity (High Plains), and Dockum aquifers. The physiography and climate, geology, previous studies, hydrostratigraphy, hydrostratigraphic framework, water levels, recharge, surface water interaction, hydraulic properties, discharge, and water quality for the High Plains Aquifer System are documented in this report. For many of these aspects of the conceptual model, new work was completed to update or add to previous studies. This conceptual model provides the foundation for developing the numerical groundwater availability model for the High Plains Aquifer System, which is documented in a separate report. The Tertiary Ogallala Aquifer forms the upper layer of the High Plains Aquifer System and is composed primarily of unconsolidated sand, gravel, and clay. This uppermost layer is entirely unconfined and overlies various other layers depending on location. The Ogallala Aquifer in Texas is separated into northern and southern parts by the Canadian River valley. In the northwest part of the High Plains Aquifer System, the Jurassic Rita Blanca Aquifer is exposed at the surface locally in northeast New Mexico and underlies the Ogallala Aquifer elsewhere. The Rita Blanca Aquifer is composed of complexly interbedded sandstones and shales and is in hydraulic communication with the overlying Ogallala Aquifer. The Cretaceous Edwards-Trinity (High Plains) Aquifer underlies the Ogallala Aquifer in the central portion of the High Plains Aquifer System and is generally composed of sandstone overlain by limestone overlain by clay/shale. However, there are some portions of the aquifer where either the limestone layer is absent (northwestern portion of the aquifer) or the clay/shale layer is absent (southern and far eastern portion of the aquifer). Where the shale layer is present, it generally serves as a confining unit for the lower layers of the aquifer. The hydrostratigraphy of the Dockum Group is quite complex, and a common approach divides it into upper and lower units. The upper Dockum Aquifer is entirely confined except for small surface exposures along the western margin of the High Plains Aquifer System. The lower Dockum Aquifer is mostly confined except for surface exposures in the Canadian River Valley and in the southeast. Both Dockum Final Conceptual Model Report for the High Plains Aquifer System Groundwater Availability Model ES-2 Group layers are composed of complexly interbedded sandstone and shale, although in general, both are sandier in their lower parts. Target water levels and hydrographs have been identified in each aquifer of the High Plains Aquifer System to be used in the calibration of the numerical model. In the Ogallala Aquifer, post-development irrigation pumping has significantly lowered the Ogallala Aquifer water table and locally affected groundwater flow direction. Pumping is now the largest discharge mechanism in the Ogallala Aquifer. Most of the pumping discharge is offset by a decrease in aquifer storage. The largest amount of pumping and corresponding drawdown occur where the initial saturated thickness was largest. Some of the pumping discharge is offset by capture, with decreased discharge to springs, streams, and other surface discharge features. Many springs have either experienced reduced flow or dried up completely. Streams and draws that were originally fed by springs or aquifer discharge also have reduced or no flow. Similar to the Ogallala Aquifer, the Rita Blanca Aquifer generally shows a decline in water levels due to increased pumping discharge, which is balanced by reduced groundwater storage and less cross- formational flow. The decline in the Edwards-Trinity (High Plains) Aquifer water levels is not as pronounced or as uniformly distributed as in the Ogallala or Rita Blanca aquifers. The increased discharge from pumping is balanced by less cross-formational flow and reduced groundwater storage. The upper Dockum Aquifer does not show a change from pre-development conditions north of the Canadian River. Little development has occurred in the upper Dockum Aquifer due to its generally low productivity. In the southern portion of the aquifer, minor water-level declines are observed across the entire aquifer with higher declines concentrated in northeastern Deaf Smith County and south-central Swisher County. The lower Dockum Aquifer has shown a more consistently distributed decline in water level than in the upper Dockum Aquifer. The highest declines are seen in northwestern Pecos County and along the border of Curry and Roosevelt counties, New Mexico. In a few local areas, particularly in the Colorado River outcrop area, increased recharge due to irrigation return flow appears to offset this increased discharge through pumping. Elsewhere, discharge through pumping is offset by reduced natural discharge to springs and streams in outcrop areas and cross-formational flow.

Final Conceptual Model Report for the High Plains Aquifer System Groundwater Availability Model ES-3 Pre-development recharge to the northern portion of the Ogallala Aquifer was estimated based on chloride mass balance analyses and ranged from 0.2 to 0.6 inches per year. Pre-development recharge to the southern portion of the Ogallala Aquifer was distributed according to playa density and ranged from 0.007 to 0.2 inches per year. Pre-development recharge to the Dockum Aquifer was based on previous studies and averaged 0.15 inches per year. Post-development recharge to the northern portion of the Ogallala Aquifer was assumed to be unchanged from pre-development recharge due to widespread low-permeability soils located under cultivated land. Post-development recharge to the southern portion of the Ogallala Aquifer was adjusted to reflect increased recharge under rainfed and irrigated cropland and ranged from 0.007 to 3 inches per year. Post-development recharge to the Dockum Aquifer was based on previous studies and averaged 0.19 inches per year. This estimate also took into account increased recharge under cultivated cropland. The interactions between the aquifers of the High Plains Aquifer System and surface water bodies, including rivers, streams, reservoirs and saline lakes, have been evaluated. Existing gain/loss studies have been evaluated to describe the gains and losses between rivers, streams and the groundwater system at snap-shots in time. Particular attention was devoted to the decline in springflow and spring-fed streams in the study area over the period of increased groundwater development. Initial distributions of hydraulic properties were developed for all aquifers in the High Plains Aquifer System. Horizontal hydraulic conductivity distributions were created using distributions from previous studies and, in the case of the Ogallala and Dockum aquifers, also incorporated recent aquifer pumping test data. Initial horizontal hydraulic conductivity values ranged from 1 to 527 feet per day in the Ogallala Aquifer, 0.1 to 11 feet per day in the Edwards-Trinity (High Plains) Aquifer, 0.01 to 6 feet per day in the upper Dockum Aquifer, and 0.09 to 22 feet per day in the lower Dockum Aquifer. Groundwater production from the aquifers of the High Plains Aquifer System is used primarily for irrigation purposes, with smaller quantities used for rural domestic, livestock, municipal, mining, manufacturing and power purposes. Pumping estimates were based on the TWDB water use survey data, metered and voluntary production rates reported by groundwater conservation districts, and historical reports. The trends in the minor aquifers of the High Plains Aquifer Final Conceptual Model Report for the High Plains Aquifer System Groundwater Availability Model ES-4 System suggest an increased use as availability in the Ogallala Aquifer declines. One of the goals of the High Plains Aquifer System groundwater availability model is to create a tool that can simulate the interaction between these aquifers as demands change through time. Water quality in the High Plains Aquifer System varies widely between different aquifers. All aquifers were evaluated with respect to total dissolved solids, sulfate, chloride, fluoride, nitrate, arsenic, irrigation salinity hazard, and sodium hazard. North of the Canadian River, the Ogallala Aquifer typically produces fresh water with total dissolved solids concentrations lower than 400 milligrams per liter. However, the Ogallala Aquifer becomes slightly saline in much of the southern portion and can produce water with total dissolved solids concentrations greater than 1,000 milligrams per liter. According to the current analysis, the average total dissolved solids concentration of all Ogallala Aquifer wells was 701 milligrams per liter. The Rita Blanca Aquifer wells produced mostly fresh water with an average total dissolved solids concentration of 307 milligrams per liter. The Edwards-Trinity (High Plains) Aquifer wells were generally slightly saline with an average total dissolved solids concentration of 2,076 milligrams per liter. Groundwater in the Dockum Group is fresh in parts of the outcrop areas but can range from slightly saline to very saline in subcrop areas. The Dockum Aquifer is defined as the portion of the Dockum Group containing groundwater with a total dissolved solids concentration less than 5,000 milligrams per liter. The average total dissolved solids concentration in upper Dockum Aquifer wells was 879 milligrams per liter and was 2,508 milligrams per liter in lower Dockum Aquifer wells. The purpose of this report is to provide a conceptual understanding, based on available data, of the hydrogeologic processes and properties governing groundwater flow in the High Plains Aquifer System. This conceptual model is prerequisite to constructing a numerical groundwater availability model for the aquifer. This report and associated geodatabase provides a documented, publicly-available, resource for use by state planners, regional water planning groups, groundwater conservation districts, groundwater management areas, and other interested stakeholders. Final Conceptual Model Report for the High Plains Aquifer System Groundwater Availability Model 1.0-1 1.0 Introduction The Texas Water Development Board (TWDB) has identified the major and minor aquifers in Texas on the basis of regional extent and amount of water produced. The major and minor aquifers are shown in Figures 1.0.1 and 1.0.2, respectively. A general discussion of the major and minor aquifers is given in George and others (2011).

Final Conceptual Model Report for the High Plains Aquifer System Groundwater Availability Model 1.0-1 1.0 Introduction The Texas Water Development Board (TWDB) has identified the major and minor aquifers in Texas on the basis of regional extent and amount of water produced. The major and minor aquifers are shown in Figures 1.0.1 and 1.0.2, respectively. A general discussion of the major and minor aquifers is given in George and others (2011). Aquifers that supply large quantities of water over large areas of the state are defined as major aquifers and those that supply relatively small quantities of water over large areas of the state or supply large quantities of water over small areas of the state are defined as minor aquifers. The High Plains Aquifer System in Texas consists of the southern and northern portions of the major Ogallala Aquifer and the minor Rita Blanca, Edwards-Trinity (High Plains), and Dockum aquifers. In the south, the Dockum Aquifer is overlain by portions of the major Pecos Valley and Edwards-Trinity (Plateau) aquifers. The Pecos Valley and Edwards Trinity (Plateau) aquifers will not be explicitly modeled as part of the High Plains Aquifer System. This report documents the development of a conceptual model for the High Plains Aquifer System groundwater availability model. The results of this analysis provide the foundation for developing the numerical groundwater availability model for the High Plains Aquifer System. The current report includes eight chapters containing the information used to develop the conceptual model of the High Plains Aquifer System, as well as an appendix addressing reviewer comments on the draft conceptual model report. Discussion of the development and calibration of the numerical model for the High Plains Aquifer System groundwater availability model is not included in this report but, rather, documented in a separate numerical model report (Deeds and Jigmond, 2015). The second numerical model report includes nine chapters and two appendices containing information on the development and calibration of the numerical model, as well as an appendix addressing reviewer comments on the draft numerical model report. The combined Ogallala and Rita Blanca aquifers comprised approximately 48 percent of the available groundwater in the state in 2010 (TWDB, 2012a). The State Water Plan (TWDB, 2012a) projects that annual groundwater availability in the Ogallala and Rita Blanca aquifers will decrease by 46 percent from 2010 to 2060 (from 6,379,999 to 3,459,076 acre-feet per year), while availability in the Dockum Group will decrease 34 percent (from 382,188 to 252,570 acre- feet per year), and availability in the Edward-Trinity (High Plains) Aquifer will decrease Final Conceptual Model Report for the High Plains Aquifer System Groundwater Availability Model 1.0-2 50 percent (from 4,160 to 2,065 acre-feet per year). The trends in the minor aquifers of the High Plains Aquifer System suggest an increased use as availability in the Ogallala Aquifer declines. One of the goals of the High Plains Aquifer System groundwater availability model is to create a tool that can simulate the interaction between these aquifers as demands change through time. In the discussion below, salinity is noted using the United States Geological Survey (2012) terminology, which defines \u201cfresh\u201d as having a total dissolved solids concentration less than 1,000 milligrams per liter, \u201cslightly saline\u201d as 1,000 to 3,000 milligrams per liter, \u201cmoderately saline\u201d as 3,000 to 10,000 milligrams per liter, and \u201cvery saline\u201d as greater than 10,000 milligrams per liter. The Ogallala Aquifer (see Figure 1.0.1) is a highly productive, unconfined aquifer and, in the northern portion located north of the Canadian River, typically produces freshwater with total dissolved solids concentrations lower than 400 milligrams per liter. However, the Ogallala Aquifer becomes slightly saline in much of the southern portion and can produce water with total dissolved solids concentrations greater than 1,000 milligrams per liter (George and others, 2011). Production in the aquifer is greatest in paleovalleys, where transmissivity and predevelopment saturated thickness are greatest, but widespread production exists outside of these areas as well (Ashworth and Hopkins, 1995). The Jurassic-age Rita Blanca Aquifer (see Figure 1.0.2) underlies the Ogallala Aquifer in the northwest corner of the Texas Panhandle, and produces moderate amounts of mostly freshwater (George and others, 2011). According to the well analysis conducted during the current study, wells producing from the Rita Blanca Aquifer are typically also completed in the overlying Ogallala Aquifer (see Section 4.3.1). In the central portion of the study area, the Ogallala Aquifer overlies the Cretaceous-age Edwards-Trinity (High Plains) Aquifer (see Figure 1.0.2), which generally yields slightly saline water with typical total dissolved solids concentrations between 1,000 and 2,000 milligrams per liter (George and others, 2011). Similar to the Rita Blanca Aquifer, wells producing from the Edwards-Trinity (High Plains) Aquifer are also often completed in the overlying Ogallala Aquifer (see Section 4.3.1). Groundwater in the Dockum Group is fresh in parts of the outcrop areas but can range from slightly saline to very saline in subcrop areas. The Dockum Aquifer (see Figure 1.0.2) is defined as the portion of the Dockum Group containing groundwater with a total dissolved solids concentration less than 5,000 milligrams per liter (Ashworth and Hopkins, 1995). Final Conceptual Model Report for the High Plains Aquifer System Groundwater Availability Model 1.0-3 The High Plains Aquifer System numerical groundwater availability model will consist of an upper layer representing the Ogallala Aquifer, a second layer representing the Rita Blanca and Edwards-Trinity (High Plains) aquifers, where present, and third and fourth layers representing the upper and lower Dockum Group. While not explicitly modeled as part of the groundwater availability model, the Pecos Valley Aquifer will be represented by the uppermost layer and the Edwards Trinity (Plateau) Aquifer will be represented by the second layer, where present. The Texas Water Code codified the requirement for generation of a State Water Plan that allows for the development, management, and conservation of water resources and the preparation and response to drought, while maintaining sufficient water available for the citizens of Texas (Texas Water Code \u00a7 16.051). Senate Bill 1 and subsequent legislation directed the TWDB to coordinate regional water planning with a process based upon public participation.

Senate Bill 1 and subsequent legislation directed the TWDB to coordinate regional water planning with a process based upon public participation. Also, as a result of Senate Bill 1, the approach to water planning in the state of Texas has shifted from a water-demand based allocation approach to an availability-based approach. Groundwater models provide a tool to estimate the effects of various water use strategies and help to determine the cumulative effects of increased water use and drought. A groundwater model is a numerical representation of the aquifer system capable of simulating historical conditions and predicting future aquifer conditions. Inherent to the groundwater model are a set of equations that are developed and applied to describe the primary or dominant physical processes considered to be controlling groundwater flow in the aquifer system. Groundwater models are essential for performing complex analyses and making informed predictions and related decisions (Anderson and Woessner, 1992). Development of groundwater availability models for the major and minor Texas aquifers is integral to the state water planning process. The purpose of the groundwater availability model program is to provide a tool that can be used to develop reliable and timely information on groundwater availability for the citizens of Texas and to ensure adequate supplies or recognize inadequate supplies over a 50-year planning period. The groundwater availability models also serve as an integral part of the process of determining modeled available groundwater based on desired future conditions, as required by House Bill 1763. The High Plains Aquifer System groundwater availability model will thus serve as a critical tool for groundwater planning in the state. Final Conceptual Model Report for the High Plains Aquifer System Groundwater Availability Model 1.0-4 The High Plains Aquifer System groundwater availability model will be developed using a modeling protocol that is standard to the groundwater modeling industry (ASTM International, 2010). This protocol includes: (1) the development of a conceptual model for groundwater flow in the aquifer, including defining physical limits and properties, (2) model design, (3) model calibration, (4) sensitivity analysis, and (5) reporting. The conceptual model is a description of the physical processes governing groundwater flow in the aquifer system. Available data and reports for the model area were reviewed in the conceptual model development stage. Model design is the process used to translate the conceptual model into a physical model, which in this case is a numerical model of groundwater flow. This involves organizing and distributing model parameters, developing a model grid and model boundary conditions, and determining the model integration time scale. Model calibration is the process of modifying model parameters so that observed field measurements (for example, water levels in wells) can be reproduced. The model will be calibrated to pre-development conditions representing, as closely as possible, conditions in the aquifer prior to significant development and to transient aquifer conditions from 1930 to 2012. Calibration will focus more on the later decades when more data are available. Sensitivity analyses will be performed on both the pre-development and transient models to offer insight on the uniqueness of the model and the impact of uncertainty in model parameter estimates.

Final Conceptual Model Report for the High Plains Aquifer System Groundwater Availability Model 1.0-6 Figure 1.0.2 Locations of minor aquifers in Texas (TWDB, 2006b). Final Conceptual Model Report for the High Plains Aquifer System Groundwater Availability Model 2.0-1 2.0 Study Area The study area incorporates all of the aquifers that comprise the High Plains Aquifer System including the Ogallala, Edwards-Trinity (High Plains), Rita Blanca, and Dockum aquifers. Also included in the study area are the Pecos Valley Aquifer and a portion of the Edwards-Trinity (Plateau) Aquifer. The location of the active model area is shown in Figure 2.0.1 and the boundaries of the relevant aquifers are given in Figure 2.0.2. The Tertiary-age Ogallala Aquifer is the largest aquifer in the United States and the most important water source in the study area (George and others, 2011). It is also referred to as part of the \u201cHigh Plains Aquifer\u201d in United States Geological Survey reports (for example, McGuire, 2014). Its non-renewable freshwater supply has been depleted by the demands of irrigation and much of the aquifer has experienced significant water-level decline since the 1940s (Ashworth and Hopkins, 1995). In the northwest portion of the study area, the Ogallala Aquifer overlies the Jurassic-age Rita Blanca Aquifer (see Figure 2.0.2). This small, but mostly fresh, minor aquifer serves as an irrigation and drinking water source for a few northwest Texas communities (George and others, 2011). In the central portion of the study area, the Ogallala Aquifer overlies the Cretaceous-age Edwards-Trinity (High Plains) Aquifer (see Figure 2.0.2), a slightly saline minor aquifer that serves mainly as an irrigation water source (George and others, 2011). The majority of the study area is underlain by the Triassic-age Dockum Aquifer (see Figure 2.0.2), which is sometimes locally referred to as the \u201cSanta Rosa Aquifer\u201d (George and others, 2011). This aquifer, while extensive spatially, is considered only a minor aquifer due to its generally poor water quality. The Dockum Group only produces freshwater in outcrop areas (located at the northwestern and southeastern ends of the current study area), with salinity increasing downdip to over 20,000 milligrams per liter. The Dockum Aquifer is, therefore, officially defined by the TWDB as the portion of the Dockum Group containing groundwater with a total dissolved solids concentration less than 5,000 milligrams per liter (Ashworth and Hopkins, 1995). While this threshold excludes most of the central portion of the Dockum Group from the official aquifer boundary due to high total dissolved solids concentrations, this portion of the Dockum Group is included in the current model for hydraulic reasons.

While this threshold excludes most of the central portion of the Dockum Group from the official aquifer boundary due to high total dissolved solids concentrations, this portion of the Dockum Group is included in the current model for hydraulic reasons. However, the numerical model will not simulate transport or variable density flow for this section. It should be noted that the higher salinity section of the Dockum Group is not completely uninteresting for Final Conceptual Model Report for the High Plains Aquifer System Groundwater Availability Model 2.0-2 water planners. Increasing water demand and the dwindling of other water sources (for example, the Ogallala Aquifer) have enhanced interest and research in brackish water development, which focuses on water sources with total dissolved solids concentrations greater than 1,000 milligrams per liter to less than 10,000 milligrams per liter (LBG-Guyton Associates, 2003). In the southern portion of the study area, where the Ogallala Aquifer does not exist (see Figure 2.0.2), other aquifers serve as the major water sources for irrigation, municipal supply, and industrial use. In the southwestern portion, this role is filled by the Quaternary-age Pecos Valley Aquifer and in the southeast, by the outcropping Cretaceous-age Edwards-Trinity (Plateau) Aquifer (George and others, 2011). Groundwater model boundaries are typically defined on the basis of surface or groundwater hydrologic boundaries. Because this model aims to provide a comprehensive view of the High Plains Aquifer System, the active model boundary was constructed by considering all of the boundaries of the aquifers in the High Plains Aquifer System. The northern boundary of the current model area is consistent with the boundaries of the northern Ogallala Aquifer groundwater availability models (Dutton and others, 2000, 2001a, 2001b; Dutton, 2004; INTERA and Dutton, 2010) with the exception of the northwestern area where the boundary was extended to include the extent of the Dockum Aquifer as defined by Ewing and others (2008). The northernmost extent of the model area is the Cimarron River (Figure 2.0.3). In the southern portion of the model area, boundaries were selected consistent with the boundary of the Dockum Aquifer groundwater availability model (Ewing and others, 2008) and the Pecos Valley Aquifer as defined by the TWDB. A slight modification to the boundary from that of the Dockum Aquifer was made in Nolan County where the Edwards-Trinity (Plateau) Aquifer overlaps the Dockum Group as indicated by HDR Engineering, Inc. (2009). The locations of rivers, streams, lakes, and reservoirs in or near the study area are shown in Figure 2.0.3. Figure 2.0.4 shows the roadways, cities, and towns in and near the study area. All or part of 68 Texas counties, 11 New Mexico counties, nine Oklahoma counties, six Kansas counties and one Colorado county are included in the study area. The largest urban areas within the model boundary are the Midland-Odessa area, Lubbock, and Amarillo, all in Texas. Figures 2.0.5 and 2.0.6 show the surface outcrop and subcrop of the major and minor aquifers, respectively, that intersect the study area. As discussed above, the major aquifers incorporated in Final Conceptual Model Report for the High Plains Aquifer System Groundwater Availability Model 2.0-3 the High Plains Aquifer System model are the Ogallala, Pecos Valley, and portions of the Edwards-Trinity (Plateau) aquifers and the minor aquifers are the Dockum, Edwards-Trinity (High Plains), and Rita Blanca aquifers. In addition to these, there are several additional minor aquifers in the study area that are not included in the High Plains Aquifer System model because they are expected to have little to no impact on the groundwater flow of the High Plains Aquifer System . The Lipan Aquifer is a very small alluvial aquifer and the Capitan Reef Complex and Rustler aquifers are much older than the aquifers of the High Plains Aquifer System and fall below the no-flow bottom boundary of the model. Since water resources are largely governed by state, not federal, laws, different portions of the study area fall under different jurisdictions depending on the state in which they are located. Of the five states in the study area, Texas groundwater has the most complex administrative infrastructure for governing water and, therefore, this discussion of the administrative boundaries focuses on Texas distinctions and includes the equivalent entities from the other states, where applicable. In Texas, Regional Water Planning Groups are the divisions used to formulate the TWDB\u2019s State Water Plan, which is updated every 5 years and focuses on both surface and groundwater resources. The study area encompasses most of three Regional Water Planning Groups (Figure 2.0.7). They are the (1) Panhandle Regional Water Planning Group (Region A), (2) Llano Estacado Regional Water Planning Group (Region O), and (3) Region F Regional Water Planning Group (Region F). Small portions of the Region B, Brazos G (Region G), and Far West Texas (Region E) Regional Water Planning Groups located in or near the study area are also included. In New Mexico, the Office of the State Engineer State Water Plan is based on Water Planning Regions, similar to the Texas Regional Water Planning Group concept (New Mexico Office of the State Engineer, 2003). Most of the Northeast New Mexico and Lea County Water Planning Regions are represented in the study area, along with small portions of the Colfax, Mora/San Miguel/Guadalupe, and Lower Pecos Valley regions. The Oklahoma Comprehensive Water Plan by the Oklahoma Water Resources Board is based on divisions called Watershed Planning Regions (Oklahoma Water Resources Board, 2011).

The Oklahoma Comprehensive Water Plan by the Oklahoma Water Resources Board is based on divisions called Watershed Planning Regions (Oklahoma Water Resources Board, 2011). Most of the Panhandle Watershed Planning Region falls within the study area, as well as small portions of the Central, West Central, and Southwest regions. The Statewide Water Supply Initiative of the Colorado Water Conservation Board (2011) and the Kansas Water Plan (Kansas Water Office, Final Conceptual Model Report for the High Plains Aquifer System Groundwater Availability Model 2.0-4 2009) use river basins to define planning regions, which are not included on Figure 2.0.7 but can be seen on the river basin map discussed below. Groundwater Management Areas in Texas are geographic areas roughly corresponding to TWDB defined aquifer flow boundaries. The Groundwater Management Areas generally contain several Groundwater Conservation Districts, political entities that can enforce some limits on groundwater use. The study area intersects portions of Texas Groundwater Management Areas 1, 2, 3 and 7 and small portions of Groundwater Management Areas 4 and 6 (Figure 2.0.8). Within these Groundwater Management Areas, the study area also includes all or part of 25 Groundwater Conservation Districts in Texas as listed in Table 2.0.1 and shown on Figure 2.0.9. In New Mexico, the Office of the State Engineer created Declared Underground Water Basins, similar in concept to the Texas Groundwater Management Areas (New Mexico Office of the State Engineer, 1995). The Canadian River, Capitan, Carlsbad, Causey Lingo, Clayton, Curry County, Fort Sumner, Jal, Lea County, Portales, Roswell, and Tucumcari Declared Underground Water Basins intersect the study area (see Figure 2.0.8). In Colorado, the Ground Water Commission (2004) established Designated Ground Water Basins, similar to Texas Groundwater Management Areas, and created Ground Water Management Districts, entities similar to Groundwater Conservation Districts that can administer groundwater use within the basins. The Colorado Southern High Plains Designated Basin intersects the study area (see Figure 2.0.8) and the Southern High Plains Management District falls within that basin, but is located outside of the study area (see Figure 2.0.9). In Kansas, Groundwater Management Districts are local government entities, similar to Texas Groundwater Conservation Districts, which can administer groundwater use (Kansas Department of Agriculture, 2010). The Southwest Kansas Groundwater Management District #3 is the only Groundwater Management District that falls within the study area (see Figure 2.0.9). In terms of surface water management, the study area intersects four Texas river authorities and one Kansas water office basin, which are given in Table 2.0.2 and shown on Figure 2.0.10. There are six major river basins and 21 sub-basins in and near the study area (Table 2.0.3 and Figure 2.0.11). Climate is the major control on flow in rivers and streams. The primary climatic factors are precipitation and evapotranspiration. In the south, the Pecos River is the only consistently perennial river and flows northwest to southeast across the study area. In general, flow in the southern rivers is episodic with extended periods of low flow, or no flow conditions Final Conceptual Model Report for the High Plains Aquifer System Groundwater Availability Model 2.0-5 and only becomes perennial towards the eastern edge of the study area. Some of these rivers tend to lose water to the underlying formations, as discussed in Section 4.5.1. In contrast, several rivers and streams in the northern portion of the study area are perennial (for example, the Canadian River) and tend to gain flow from the underlying saturated sediments and/or underlying aquifers. Table 2.0.3 provides a listing of the rivers in the study area and their associated river basins and sub-basins.

Final Conceptual Model Report for the High Plains Aquifer System Groundwater Availability Model 2.1-1 2.1 Physiography and Climate The study area for High Plains Aquifer System groundwater availability model falls within the Great Plains province of the Interior Plains physiographic region as defined by Fenneman and Johnson (1946). The majority of the study area is in the High Plains section, the remnant of a smooth alluvial plain that stretched from the Rocky Mountains to the central lowlands of Texas (Figure 2.1.1). The northwestern corner lies within the Raton section, an eroded zone characterized by volcanic features such as lava-capped plateaus and buttes. The northeastern corner is in the Plains Border section, an eroded zone marking the edge of the High Plains. The western and southwestern edges of the study area lie in the Pecos Valley section, a long trough separating the High Plains section from the western Basin and Range section. In the southeast corner, the High Plains transitions to the plain atop the Edwards Plateau section, a plateau formed by the massive south-dipping Edwards limestone. The eastern edge of the High Plains section is marked by the Osage Plains section of the Central Lowlands province and the highly eroded Central Texas section (descriptions from United States Department of Defense, 2001). Figure 2.1.2 shows the Level III Ecological Regions in the study area as defined by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (2011). Ecological regions (also referred to as ecoregions) refer to areas exhibiting a distinct ecosystem type. The conterminous United States is divided into Level III Ecoregions based on factors such as vegetation, climate, hydrology, geology, and physiography. The majority of the study area falls within the High Plains Ecoregion, which consists predominately of cropland on smooth to slightly irregular plains. This ecoregion corresponds roughly to the High Plains physiographic section defined by Fenneman and Johnson (1946) as discussed above. The Southwestern Tablelands Ecoregion makes up a portion of the study area, cutting through the High Plains Ecoregion around the Canadian River Basin. This area is largely uncultivated, characterized by semiarid grassland and rangeland as well as canyons, mesas, and badlands. The study area is bounded in the northeast by the Central Great Plains Ecoregion. Like the High Plains Ecoregion, this region is largely under cultivation, but at lower elevations and with a wetter climate. The Edwards Plateau Ecoregion bounds the study area in the southeast and roughly corresponds with the Edwards Plateau physiographic region in Fenneman and Johnson (1946). It is characterized by karst topography and savanna vegetation and, is used mostly as grazing land. The study area is bounded to the southwest by Final Conceptual Model Report for the High Plains Aquifer System Groundwater Availability Model 2.1-2 the Chihuahuan Deserts Ecoregion, a basin and range terrain mostly covered with desert grassland and shrubland. Figure 2.1.3 provides a topographic map of the study area (United States Geological Survey, 2012). Generally, the surface elevation decreases from northwest to southeast across the study area. The ground-surface elevation varies from over 7,400 feet above mean sea level in the northwest to less than 2,100 feet above mean sea level in the southeast along the Colorado River valley. The High Plains can be seen as a relatively uniform surface with a distinct escarpment at the eastern transition to the plains of central Texas. The drainage features of the major rivers can be seen in the topography in much of the study area, particularly the Canadian, Beaver, and Pecos rivers, which have created deeply incised valleys in some places. The climate in the Texas portion of the study area is classified predominantly as Continental Steppe, as defined in Larkin and Bomar (1983) (Figure 2.1.4). This type of climate is typical of continental interiors. It is a semi-arid climate characterized by large variations in daily temperatures, low"

The ground-surface elevation varies from over 7,400 feet above mean sea level in the northwest to less than 2,100 feet above mean sea level in the southeast along the Colorado River valley. The High Plains can be seen as a relatively uniform surface with a distinct escarpment at the eastern transition to the plains of central Texas. The drainage features of the major rivers can be seen in the topography in much of the study area, particularly the Canadian, Beaver, and Pecos rivers, which have created deeply incised valleys in some places. The climate in the Texas portion of the study area is classified predominantly as Continental Steppe, as defined in Larkin and Bomar (1983) (Figure 2.1.4). This type of climate is typical of continental interiors. It is a semi-arid climate characterized by large variations in daily temperatures, low relative humidity, and irregularly spaced rainfall of moderate amounts (Larkin and Bomar, 1983). The very eastern, southeastern, southern, and southwestern Texas portions of the study area are in the Modified Marine, or Subtropical, climatic division. Subdivisions of the Subtropical climatic division are created by changes in the moisture content of the onshore flow of air from the Gulf of Mexico. Air from the Gulf decreases in moisture content as it travels across the state. In addition, intrusion of continental air into the Gulf maritime air occurs seasonally and affects the moisture content of the air. Different portions of the study area fall under the subdivisions Subtropical Subhumid, Subtropical Steppe, and Subtropical Arid (see Figure 2.1.4), with Subtropical Subhumid having the highest moisture content and Subtropical Arid having the lowest (Larkin and Bomar, 1983). The Parameter-elevation Regressions on Independent Slopes Model (PRISM) precipitation dataset developed and presented online by the Oregon Climate Service at Oregon State University provides a distribution of average annual precipitation and temperature across the active model area based on the period from 1981 to 2010 (Oregon Climate Service, 2013). In general, the average annual precipitation in the study area (Figure 2.1.5) increases from the west to the east and from a low of about 11 inches to a high of about 28 inches. The average annual temperature in the study area (Figure 2.1.6) ranges from a high of 67 degrees Fahrenheit in the Final Conceptual Model Report for the High Plains Aquifer System Groundwater Availability Model 2.1-3 south to a low of 44 degrees Fahrenheit in the northwest based on the period from 1981 to 2010 (Oregon Climate Service, 2013). Precipitation data are available at over 100 Texas stations within the study area (Figure 2.1.7) from as early as 1931 through the present (National Climate Data Center, 2012). Measurement of precipitation at most gages began in the 1940s or 1950s. In general, measurements are not continuous on a month-by-month or year-by-year basis for the gages. Examples of historical variation in annual precipitation at selected gages in the study area are shown in Figure 2.1.8. On this figure, the blue lines represent annual precipitation and the red dashed lines correspond to the mean annual precipitation. A discontinuity in the blue line indicates a break in the availability of annual precipitation data. Figure 2.1.9 shows long-term average monthly variation in annual precipitation at selected gages. This figure illustrates the difference in precipitation patterns between the eastern and western portions of the study area. In the east, precipitation peaks in late spring to early summer and again in early fall. In the west, precipitation is lower and only peaks once during the summer. Average annual lake evaporation in the study area ranges from a high of 72 inches per year in the south to a low of 59 inches per year in the north (TWDB, 2012b), as shown in Figure 2.1.10. Evaporation rates significantly exceed the average annual rainfall (see Figure 2.1.5) in all portions of the study area but especially in the south, where deficits (evaporation exceeds precipitation) are over 60 inches per year. Monthly variations in lake surface evaporation are shown in Figure 2.1.11 for five locations in the study area. These values represent the average of the monthly lake surface evaporation data from January 1954 through December 2011. Figure 2.1.11 shows that average lake evaporation peaks in July.

Final Conceptual Model Report for the High Plains Aquifer System Groundwater Availability Model 2.2-1 2.2 Geology The geology of the High Plains Aquifer System includes up to 2,400 feet of rocks and sediments ranging in age from Triassic (245 million years) to Recent. Our conceptualization of this large and diverse rock volume integrates two components: (1) a synthesis of previous studies that cover various parts of the High Plains Aquifer System and (2) a comprehensive, geophysical-log- based study that was conducted for this project. The High Plains Aquifer System encompasses all or parts of six aquifers: the Triassic Dockum Aquifer, the Jurassic-Cretaceous Rita Blanca Aquifer, the Cretaceous Edwards-Trinity (Plateau) Aquifer, the Cretaceous Edwards-Trinity (High Plains) Aquifer, the Tertiary Ogallala Aquifer (along with surficial Quaternary deposits), and the Quaternary Pecos Valley Aquifer (Table 2.2.1). The Edwards-Trinity (Plateau) and Edwards-Trinity (High Plains) aquifers are composed of similar geologic formations but are geographically separated. In general, aquifers of the High Plains Aquifer System have distinct geographic locations and stratigraphic positions. Tertiary and Quaternary formations, which contain both the Ogallala and Pecos Valley aquifers, cover most of the land surface, whereas Cretaceous and Triassic formations crop out in the southeast and elsewhere in drainage valleys, canyons, and draws (Figure 2.2.1). 2.2.1 Tectonic History The High Plains Aquifer System is everywhere underlain by low permeability Permian formations. The Permian Basin, a large subsided area across west Texas and eastern New Mexico, encompasses several structural subbasins and uplifted areas (Figure 2.2.2). The Triassic Dockum Group records the final filling of the Dalhart, Palo Duro, and Midland subbasins. The Dockum Group thickens into basinal areas and thins across uplifted areas. The change from Permian marine sedimentation to Triassic nonmarine sedimentation was a response to plate tectonic uplift related to the opening of the Gulf of Mexico (McGowen and others, 1979). Uplift closed the Permian seaway, resulting in the formation of a freshwater, inland basin during the time of the Dockum Group. The top of the Dockum Group surface records tectonic tilting eastward and multiple episodes of post-Dockum Group erosion. Following the Triassic Period, the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods were characterized by long- term rising sea level and marine flooding of the continent. Crustal subsidence related to continued opening of the Gulf of Mexico caused reorientation of continental drainage during the Final Conceptual Model Report for the High Plains Aquifer System Groundwater Availability Model 2.2-2 Jurassic Period (Fallin, 1989). River systems that during the Triassic had flowed into closed lacustrine basins began flowing southeastward toward the Gulf of Mexico. Early Cretaceous rivers eroded valleys into the underlying surface of the Dockum Group. Cretaceous rocks were once widespread, but post-Cretaceous uplift and erosion removed them from large areas. Isolated remnants of Cretaceous rocks form the Edwards-Trinity (High Plains) aquifer (Fallin, 1989). Another erosional remnant in the northwest composed of Jurassic and Cretaceous mixed nonmarine and marine rocks, forms the Rita Blanca Aquifer (Mankin, 1958). The Edwards- Trinity (Plateau) Aquifer is not an erosional remnant but instead is continuous to the east with Cretaceous formations in the Gulf of Mexico basin (Barker and Ardis, 1992, 1996). The northwestern edge of the Edwards-Trinity (Plateau) Aquifer, however, is erosionally truncated where it extends into the study area (see Figure 2.0.2). Tertiary and Quaternary formations were deposited on a heavily eroded surface. Early Tertiary Laramide compressional tectonics resulted in formation of the Rocky Mountains along with uplift and eastward tilting in the study area. Eastward flowing fluvial systems eroded deep valleys into Cretaceous, Triassic, and Permian surfaces. Topographically elevated ridges were preserved between valleys. More irregular topography formed locally owing to dissolution of Permian evaporites (salt) by meteoric groundwater and collapse of the overlying surface (Gustavson and others, 1980; Seni, 1980). The Ogallala Formation was deposited on this eroded surface during the Miocene and Pliocene epochs (4.5 to 11 million years ago) of the Tertiary Period (Schultz, 1990). The upper surface of the Ogallala Formation is also an erosional remnant, having once extended from the Rocky Mountains to north-central Texas (Reeves, 1972). The caprock escarpment now forms a prominent erosional boundary on the east side of the study area, and the Pecos River valley truncates the Ogallala Formation in New Mexico. In Texas, Tertiary and Quaternary alluvial fill in the Pecos River valley forms a major aquifer in the southwest part of High Plains (see Figure 2.0.2) (Meyer and others, 2012). 2.2.2 Depositional Environments The vertical succession of geologic formations in the High Plains Aquifer System records several major alternations between marine and nonmarine depositional environments. Upper Permian formations were deposited in shallow-water marine environments, which became increasingly more restricted northwards. More open marine circulation occurred in the south, whereas the north was occupied by closed hyper saline basins (Presley, 1981). Thus, limestones are more Final Conceptual Model Report for the High Plains Aquifer System Groundwater Availability Model 2.2-3 abundant in the south and evaporites (primarily gypsum and halite) are more abundant in the north. Eventually, Permian marine basins filled to sea level, and arid-region, fine-grained clastics (red beds) dominate uppermost Permian sediments (Nance, 1988). In the central parts of the basin, the Permian-Triassic boundary is apparently conformable and not easily identifiable."

In Texas, Tertiary and Quaternary alluvial fill in the Pecos River valley forms a major aquifer in the southwest part of High Plains (see Figure 2.0.2) (Meyer and others, 2012). 2.2.2 Depositional Environments The vertical succession of geologic formations in the High Plains Aquifer System records several major alternations between marine and nonmarine depositional environments. Upper Permian formations were deposited in shallow-water marine environments, which became increasingly more restricted northwards. More open marine circulation occurred in the south, whereas the north was occupied by closed hyper saline basins (Presley, 1981). Thus, limestones are more Final Conceptual Model Report for the High Plains Aquifer System Groundwater Availability Model 2.2-3 abundant in the south and evaporites (primarily gypsum and halite) are more abundant in the north. Eventually, Permian marine basins filled to sea level, and arid-region, fine-grained clastics (red beds) dominate uppermost Permian sediments (Nance, 1988). In the central parts of the basin, the Permian-Triassic boundary is apparently conformable and not easily identifiable. In those areas siltstone and mudstone red beds are present continuously across the boundary, suggesting that environmental change was not abrupt (Johns, 1989). In more peripheral areas, especially in outcrops, Permian and Triassic rocks are separated by an unconformity (McGowen and others, 1979; Lucas and Anderson, 1992). Although environmental changes occurred gradually, the Triassic Dockum Group is significantly different from underlying upper Permian formations. Three major changes mark the transition into the Triassic: (1) shift from marine to nonmarine terrestrial environments, (2) climate change from arid to humid tropical, and (3) uplift of peripheral sediment source areas (McGowen and others, 1979; Johns, 1989). After the southern connection between the Permian Basin and world oceans was cut off, a large inland lacustrine basin formed, and major rivers flowed into this Dockum Basin from several directions (Figure 2.2.3). Sandstones were deposited in fluvial channels and lacustrine deltas, whereas mudstones were deposited in prodelta and offshore lacustrine environments. Climatic changes raised and lowered lake levels, causing cyclic shoreline progradation and transgression and resulting in sandstone/shale interbedding in the Dockum Group. In addition to this small-scale cyclicity, the Dockum Group is subdivided into upper and lower units based on regional upward fining trends (Granata, 1981). These large-scale trends probably record episodes of uplift in the source area and sand influx to the basin followed by gradual subsidence and decreasing sand influx. Thus, the lower and upper Dockum intervals are sandiest in their lower parts (Figure 2.2.4). Depositional environments become more marine-influenced again in the Cretaceous. Jurassic formations in northeastern New Mexico and Dallam and Hartley counties, Texas, were deposited in nonmarine, arid-region, eolian, fluvial, and lacustrine environments, whereas overlying Cretaceous formations record several marine transgressions from east to west (Mankin, 1958). Thus, sandstones in the Rita Blanca Aquifer are mixed nonmarine and transgressive marine shoreline deposits. Formations in both the Edwards-Trinity (High Plains) and Edwards-Trinity (Plateau) aquifers were deposited in marine environments (Fallin, 1989; Barker and Ardis, 1992, 1996). Basal Antlers sandstones are marine shoreline deposits, whereas overlying Walnut and Final Conceptual Model Report for the High Plains Aquifer System Groundwater Availability Model 2.2-4 Comanche Peak shales and shaly limestones are primarily lagoonal deposits. Massive Edwards limestones were deposited on a widespread carbonate platform. The overlying Kiamichi and Duck Creek formations are composed of thick shales with thin limestone and sandstone interbeds, which were deposited in lagoonal and open marine environments. The end of the Cretaceous Period marked a return to nonmarine conditions. Tertiary formations of the High Plains were all deposited in nonmarine environments. Regionally, the Ogallala Formation forms a broad alluvial apron adjacent to the Rocky Mountains. Within this alluvial fan depositional system, the thickest and coarsest grained sediments are fluvial channel facies in alluvial fan lobes deposited in paleovalleys (Seni, 1980; Gustavson, 1996). Several overlapping alluvial fan lobes were deposited and then abandoned successively from north to south (Figure 2.2.5). This southward shift in depositional location was controlled primarily by elevation of the underlying surface. The lowest surface (Permian) had to be filled before higher surfaces (Dockum and Cretaceous) could accommodate sediment. Ogallala Formation alluvial fan deposits become finer grained with distance from the mountain front source areas. Most sediments in the preserved extent of the Ogallala Formation are sands and gravels that were deposited in braided stream channels (Seni, 1980). The upper part of the Ogallala Formation includes widespread eolian fine sand, silt, and clay. Calcic soil horizons are common in the upper part of the Ogallala Formation. The Caprock caliche is a 6-foot-thick bed of erosion-resistant white calcium carbonate-rich rock at the upper Ogallala Formation surface, which records a long period of landscape stability and soil formation (Gustavson, 1996). The Quaternary Blackwater Draw Formation is composed of eolian sands and soil horizons, which are similar to those in the upper part of the Ogallala. The Quaternary Pecos Valley Alluvium Formation consists of both alluvial and eolian deposits (Meyer and others, 2012). Most of the alluvium is in the form of alluvial fans entering the valley from Trans-Pecos uplands to the southwest. Surficial alluvial sediments are wind-reworked into large sand dunes. 2.2.3 Stratigraphy This section presents an overview of the stratigraphy and lithology of the geologic formations that comprise the High Plains Aquifer System. More detailed stratigraphic descriptions that are based on our geophysical log study are presented in Section 4.2.5. High Plains aquifers are primarily in sands and sandstones, although gravel is common in the Ogallala Aquifer. The main sandy aquifer formations are the Santa Rosa and Trujillo formations in the Dockum Aquifer, the Final Conceptual Model Report for the High Plains Aquifer System Groundwater Availability Model 2.2-5 Exeter Formation in the Rita Blanca Aquifer, the Antlers Formation in the Edwards-Trinity (High Plains) Aquifer, the Ogallala Formation of the Ogallala Aquifer, and the Pecos Valley Alluvium Formation of the Pecos Valley Aquifer (see Table 2.2.1). These sand-rich formations are separated vertically from each other by fine-grained formations, which are composed mainly of silt, clay, and/or argillaceous limestone. Exceptions to this vertical confinement are outcropping formations, primarily the Ogallala and Pecos Valley Alluvium formations and locally the Dockum Group (see Figure 2.2.1). The Cretaceous Edwards Formation is the only potential limestone aquifer. Geologic formations vary geographically in thickness and lithology, and so formations defined in outcrop may not resemble those encountered miles away in the subsurface. For example, correlation of Dockum Group formations from outcrop to subsurface is uncertain (Johns,"

Nevertheless, a general vertical trend is present in the Dockum Group throughout the study area that coincides with outcrop descriptions. The Dockum Group is divisible into upper and lower intervals based on upward transitions of sandstone to shale (see Figure 2.2.4). The sand-rich part of the lower Dockum Group corresponds to the Santa Rosa Formation of outcrop, and the sand- rich part of the upper Dockum Group corresponds to the Trujillo Formation (see Table 2.2.1). The details of Dockum Group sandstone-shale interbedding, however, are more complicated and are described in Section 4.2.5. Cretaceous formations, which were deposited primarily in marine environments, display more laterally persistent thickness and lithology trends than do nonmarine formations in the Dockum Group. Cretaceous marine environments were large. Quiet-water lagoons and wave-swept platforms individually covered 20 to 30 counties in central and west Texas (Fisher and Rodda, 1969). Partly because of this lateral continuity, Cretaceous formations are better defined and correlated in both outcrop and subsurface than are formations in the Dockum Group. In the study area, the Cretaceous interval consists of a sandstone lower part (Antlers Formation) and a limestone upper part (Edwards Formation) interbedded with several thin shale-dominated formations (see Table 2.2.1). The Ogallala Formation is composed mainly of sand and gravel near the base and sand and clay in the upper part (Seni, 1980; Gustavson, 1996). Pebble- to boulder-size gravel lenses are common along the basal surface (Figure 2.2.6). Note that the location of the cross section in Final Conceptual Model Report for the High Plains Aquifer System Groundwater Availability Model 2.2-6 Figure 2.2.6 is shown in Figure 2.2.7. Cross-stratified coarse sand and pebble-sized gravel typically overlie basal gravel deposits. These coarse-grained, lower Ogallala Formation sediments are mostly unconsolidated, although calcite cementation is present locally. Clay- dominated lenses are also present locally along the basal surface. The middle part of the Ogallala Formation contains less gravel and more sand and clay. Lenses of medium-grained sand are typically enclosed in large bodies of fine-grained sand and clay. The upper part of the Ogallala Formation is a heterogeneous mixture of sand, silt, clay, caliche, and soil horizons (see Figure 2.2.6).

Final Conceptual Model Report for the High Plains Aquifer System Groundwater Availability Model 3.1-1 3.0 Previous Investigations Numerous reports and papers documenting previous investigations of the formations composing the High Plains Aquifer System are available in the literature. A number of numerical models of the High Plains Aquifer System, or individual aquifers within the system, have been developed. The majority of the literature discusses the Ogallala Aquifer or the combined High Plains Aquifer System. This section provides a cursory review of the literature focusing on seminal works and/or relevant studies. The following discussion of previous investigations is divided into those related to geology and/or hydrogeology and those related to numerical modeling. 3.1 Previous Geologic and/or Hydrogeologic Investigations Previous investigations related to the geology and hydrogeology of the High Plains Aquifer System are numerous. Several historical reports provide well-presented discussions of previous investigations. When available, those discussions are presented here. This section is divided into five subsections which discuss early investigations of the High Plains related predominantly to the portion in Texas and/or New Mexico, regional studies of the High Plains Aquifer System, studies specific to the Ogallala Aquifer, studies specific to the Edwards-Trinity (High Plains) Aquifer, and studies specific to the Dockum Aquifer. There are no previous investigations of the Rita Blanca Aquifer, however, the sediments composing this aquifer are discussed in several of the general High Plains investigations. 3.1.1 Early Investigations of the High Plains in Texas and/or New Mexico In general, the early investigations of the High Plains provide an overview of geology and groundwater resources rather than detailed discussions of specific formations or aquifers. White and others (1940) provide a discussion of previous investigations conducted in the High Plains from 1900 to about 1939. The following is taken from their report. \u201cW.D. Johnson [Johnson, 1901, 1902] spent several years on the High Plains just prior to 1900 and published his findings in the 21st and 22nd Annual Reports of the U.S. Geological Survey. These relate in part to the ground-water resources. The geology and ground-water resources of the northern 20 counties of the Texas Final Conceptual Model Report for the High Plains Aquifer System Groundwater Availability Model 3.1-2 Panhandle were studied by C.N. Gould in 1904-05 and the results published in Water-Supply Papers 154 and 191 of the U.S. Geological Survey [Gould, 1906, 1907]. In 1909, O.E. Meinzer [Meinzer, 1909] made a brief study of ground- water on the High Plains in Portales Valley, New Mexico, and gave his conclusions in a manuscript report. C.L. Baker of the Texas Bureau of Economic Geology made a study of the geology and hydrology of a part of the region in 1914, and the following year published the results in Bulletin 57 of The University of Texas [Baker, 1915]. His report contains two chapters on ground water, and tables of water-well logs and water analyses, including information on the depth to water in a considerable number of wells, a part of which he determined by measurements. \u2026.A reconnaissance investigation of ground water in the High Plains of Texas and also of Kansas, Colorado, New Mexico, and Oklahoma was made by C.V. Theis, H.P. Burleigh, and H.A. Waite in 1933-34 [Theis and others, 1935]. In this investigation a large amount of preliminary data was obtained, including well records and measurements of water levels in wells, of which several were located in Texas. During the last four years [1936 to 1939] inventories of water wells have been made in all or parts of \u2026 counties of the High Plains\u2026.The counties partly or fully covered by the inventories are Andrews, Armstrong, Bailey, Carson, Castro, Crosby, Dallam, Ector, Floyd, Glasscock, Hall, Hansford, Hartley, Hockley, Howard, Lamb, Lubbock, Martin, Midland, Ochiltree, Oldham, Parmer, Potter, Randall, and Roberts \u2026. Dawson, Deaf Smith, and Swisher Counties and parts of Hale and Floyd Counties\u2026Mimeographed bulletins giving tables of well records, well logs, and water analyses, together with a map showing the location of the wells, have been issued for all these counties.\u201d A series of progress reports on groundwater in the High Plains of Texas are provided in White and others (1940), Alexander and others (1943), Broadhurst (1944), Alexander (1945), White and others (1946), Broadhurst (1947), and Barnes and others (1949) (southern High Plains), and Final Conceptual Model Report for the High Plains Aquifer System Groundwater Availability Model 3.1-3 Alexander (1961) (northern High Plains). These progress reports document investigations on the geology, source and extent of groundwater resources, use of groundwater for irrigation purposes, and changes in water levels. A study of the geology and groundwater in the irrigated region of the southern High Plains in Texas was conducted by Barnes and others (1949). Their report provides brief discussions of the geology, recharge, natural discharge, water levels, water quantity, and water quality in the region. Also included in their report is a summary of the development of the groundwater resources in the irrigation region of the southern High Plains. Leggat (1951) provides a brief summary of the development of irrigation wells in the High Plains of Texas. He indicates that the use of wells for irrigation purposes began in 1911 and slowly increased to a total of 600 irrigation wells in 1936. The number of irrigation wells nearly doubled in 1937 and increased at a rate of 120 to 480 wells per"

The number of irrigation wells nearly doubled in 1937 and increased at a rate of 120 to 480 wells per year from 1938 through 1943. Over the period from 1943 through 1950, an additional 11,550 irrigation wells were drilled. Leggat (1951) states that the total number of irrigation wells in the Texas High Plains was 14,500 at the start of 1951. Of those wells, 14,000 were located in a 21-county region in the southern High Plains. He reports that the largest declines in water level have occurred in northwestern Floyd County and in Randall County southwest of the city of Amarillo. Additional discussions of water-level fluctuations and declines in this region are provided in Leggat (1954a, 1954b). Numerous reports containing records of water-level measurements have been developed by the United States Geological Survey, the Texas Board of Water Engineers (TWDB predecessor), and the North Plains Ground Water Conservation District No. 2 (North Plains Ground Water Conservation District predecessor). In addition, reports documenting irrigation surveys for the High Plains of Texas in 1964 through 1977 by the Texas A&M Texas Agricultural Extension Service are available (New, 1964-1977). Early reports documenting records of wells in many of the counties located in the study area were published by the Texas Board of Water Engineers. The references for those reports are provided in Table 3.1.1 by county. Several county-based investigations on water resources have also been published as documented in Table 3.1.1. Final Conceptual Model Report for the High Plains Aquifer System Groundwater Availability Model 3.1-4 3.1.2 Regional Studies A summary of the occurrence and development of groundwater in the southern High Plains of Texas is provided in Cronin (1961). He provides a summary of the geology and a brief discussion of water supply in the Dockum Group, Cretaceous Rocks, and Ogallala Formation. A more detailed discussion on the groundwater in the Ogallala Formation including hydraulic properties, groundwater movement, water level conditions, recharge, natural discharge, water in storage, and water quality is provided in Cronin (1961). Knowles and others (1984) document the results of a regional groundwater study of the High Plains Aquifer system. This study was conducted by the Texas Department of Water Resources (TWDB predecessor) in cooperation with Texas Tech University and the water districts in the area. The purposes of the study were to \u201cimprove the data base describing the aquifer; to better describe the occurrence, operation, and use of the aquifer; and to develop a computer model of the aquifer.\u201d (Knowles and others, 1984). Their report describes the stratigraphy of the Ogallala Formation and associated water-bearing formations; describes the High Plains aquifer, including recharge, discharge, hydraulic characteristics, water quality, and water levels; describes the developed computer model; and presents the model results. The High Plains Aquifer System was studied by the United States Geological Survey as part of their Regional Aquifer-System Analysis program. This study was one of the first conducted under this program. As a part of that study, the United States Geological Survey published a report on the geohydrology of the High Plains Aquifer provided in Gutentag and others (1984). That report provides a brief overview of development and production; a detailed discussion of the geology; a discussion of the groundwater hydrology; and a discussion of the quality of the groundwater. 3.1.3 Ogallala Aquifer Nativ (1988) provides a discussion of the hydrogeology and hydrochemistry of the Ogallala Aquifer in the Texas panhandle and eastern New Mexico. She states that both of these aspects of the aquifer are primarily a function of the thickness, permeability, and mineralogy of the Ogallala Formation and the subjacent paleotopography. Nativ (1988) observed two hydrogeologic provinces in the Ogallala Aquifer; a thicker, more permeable section of the Final Conceptual Model Report for the High Plains Aquifer System Groundwater Availability Model 3.1-5 aquifer located in paleovalleys and a second thinner, less permeable section of the aquifer located between paleovalleys. She states that the hydrochemical composition of the groundwater in the first province is relatively constant. In the second province, the hydrochemical composition of the groundwater is variable due to cross formation flow from the underlying Cretaceous, Triassic, and Permian aquifers into the Ogallala Aquifer and the low permeability of the Ogallala Aquifer. Based on high tritium values in the groundwater, Nativ (1988) suggests the possibility of rapid recharge to the Ogallala Aquifer in Hockley, Lamb, Lubbock, and Terry counties where the unsaturated zone is relatively thin. In the remaining portion of the aquifer, she found tritium values to be essentially zero and attributed these low values to the thicker unsaturated zone. Nativ (1988) indicates that recharge to the Ogallala Aquifer likely occurs from underlying aquifers where the hydraulic head in the underlying aquifer is higher than that in the Ogallala Aquifer and the two aquifers are in hydraulic connection. Natural discharge of water from the Ogallala Aquifer is reported by Nativ (1988) to be through springs, seeps, leakage to underlying formation, and possibly into adjacent formations east of the Eastern Caprock Escarpment. Nativ (1988) used the chemical and isotopic composition of groundwater in the Ogallala Aquifer and underlying aquifers to trace cross-formation flow into and out of the Ogallala Aquifer. She identifies areas where the data indicate upward flow from the underlying Edwards-Trinity (High Plains) and Dockum aquifers and Permian-age formation into the Ogallala Aquifer. Nativ (1988) also compared the chemistry of groundwater in the Ogallala Aquifer to oil field brines to investigate contamination of the Ogallala Aquifer by oil field brines. She identified several places in Andrews, Howard, Gaines, and Hockley counties where contamination"

Provided in his report is a discussion of the geology, which includes the regional setting, tectonic history, and Cretaceous system stratigraphy and depositional history. He also presents a detailed discussion of the hydrogeology of the these sediments, which includes regional characteristics by water-bearing unit(s) (that is, Final Conceptual Model Report for the High Plains Aquifer System Groundwater Availability Model 3.1-6 Antlers Formation, combined Comanche Peak and Edwards formations, and combined Kiamichi and Duck Creek formations), regional recharge and discharge, and utilization and development. His discussions for each water-bearing unit include general features, pumping test data, water quality and chemistry, and regional storage. An evaluation of the hydrogeology and hydrochemistry of the Cretaceous aquifers in the Texas panhandle and eastern New Mexico is provided in Nativ and Gutierrez (1988). They state that their study \u201cis the first attempt to outline a hydrologic conceptual model of the Cretaceous aquifers beneath the Southern High Plains and to evaluate the role of these aquifers within the regional hydrologic system.\u201d Nativ and Gutierrez (1988) provide discussions of hydrologic setting, geologic framework, hydrogeology, and hydrochemistry. Their discussion of the geologic framework includes information on the lithologic characterization of the contact between the Cretaceous sediments and the sediments of the overlying and underlying Ogallala and Dockum aquifers, respectively, to identify locations where there may be continuous permeability across aquifers. Their section on hydrogeology includes a discussion of the potentiometric surfaces in the Cretaceous aquifers and the overlying Ogallala Aquifer and underlying Dockum Aquifer to identify the direction of potential flow between the aquifers. Discussions of recharge, discharge, and saturated thickness were also included in their hydrogeology section. Using groundwater chemistry and isotopic data, Nativ and Gutierrez (1988) created a hydrochemical facies map of the Cretaceous aquifer, evaluated the effects of vadose zone thickness on chemical composition, assessed recharge from precipitation, and evaluated the hydraulic communication between the Cretaceous aquifers and the overlying and underlying Ogallala and Dockum aquifers, respectively, and investigated areas of potential contamination. 3.1.5 Dockum Aquifer A summary of previous investigations related to the Dockum Aquifer is available in Ewing and others (2008). The following is taken from that report. \u201cThe Triassic-age Dockum Group in western Texas and eastern New Mexico has been the subject of numerous studies. A majority of the studies relate to the depositional history and/or lithostratigraphic correlations of the Dockum Group. Final Conceptual Model Report for the High Plains Aquifer System Groundwater Availability Model 3.1-7 W.F. Cummins (1890) described and named outcropping redbeds in western Dickens County, Texas the \u201cDockum beds\u201d; the following year he stated their age as Triassic (Cummins, 1891). Since then, numerous researchers have studied Dockum Group outcrops along the eastern margin of the Texas Panhandle and the Canadian River valley into eastern New Mexico. In more recent times, researchers have evaluated geophysical logs from wells drilled through the Dockum Group, and have attempted to piece together its subsurface stratigraphy. Each researcher recognized locally identifiable stratigraphic sequences and often assigned a name to each. A generalized summary of Dockum Group nomenclature is presented in Table 3.0.1 [of Ewing and others, 2008]. Gould (1907) first subdivided the Dockum (Group) in the Canadian River valley in the Texas Panhandle into a basal shale or mudstone unit that he named the Tecovas Formation and an upper sandstone and shale unit he named the Trujillo Formation. Drake (1891) studied the Dockum Group outcrop from Big Spring to Amarillo, Texas and westward to Tucumcari, New Mexico. His correlations were later reexamined by Hoots (1926), Darton (1928), and Adams (1929), who introduced such names as Chinle and Santa Rosa into the stratigraphic complexity. Adkins (1932) also mentioned other localized stratigraphic names such as Barstow, Quito, Camp Springs, Dripping Springs, and Taylor. McGowen and others (1975; 1977; 1979) and Granata (1981) analyzed Triassic strata in terms of genetic facies that compose depositional systems. For the purpose of developing sandstone distribution maps, they subdivided the Dockum Group into a mud-rich \u201cUpper Dockum Unit\u201d and a sand-rich \u201cLower Dockum Unit\u201d. These units were characterized as informal and were not intended to be construed as being of stratigraphic status. Hart and others (1976) also divided the Dockum Group in the western Oklahoma Panhandle into upper and lower units. Johns (1989), working in the Palo Duro Basin area, described the depositional origin of Dockum Group rocks, mapped the distribution of major lithofacies, and Final Conceptual Model Report for the High Plains Aquifer System Groundwater Availability Model 3.1-8 determined the influences controlling sandstone thickness. The lower portion of the Dockum Group of McGowen and others (1977) is distinguished by four cyclic, coarsening upward sequences with more abundant sands, while more isolated sands embedded in predominantly mudstone characterizes the upper portion of the Dockum Group. Lucas and Anderson (1992; 1993; 1994; 1995) suggested a revision of the Dockum from Group status (Chinle being the new group name) to formation status and identified a number of localized member subdivisions. Lehman (1994a; 1994b) defined the Dockum with Group status, subdivided into four formations in Texas (Santa Rosa Sandstone, Tecovas Formation, Trujillo Sandstone, and Cooper Canyon Formation). Bradley and Kalaswad (2003) support the stratigraphic divisions of Lehman (1994a; 1994b); however, they refer in their cross-sections to the \"Best Sandstone\", which"

They also note that locally, any water-bearing sandstone within the Dockum Group is typically referred to as the Santa Rosa Aquifer. \u2026. \u2026. A summary of the hydrogeochemistry and water resources of the lower Dockum Group in west Texas and eastern New Mexico is reported in Dutton and Simpkins (1986). Dutton and Simpkins (1986) and Dutton (1995) present a source for the isotopically light \u03b4D and \u03b418O composition of the groundwater found in the Dockum Group.

In addition, a final section summaries how the High Plains Aquifer System groundwater availability model will incorporate and improve upon previous models. 3.2.1 High Plains Aquifer System and Ogallala Aquifer Models The primary aquifer in the High Plains Aquifer System is the Ogallala Aquifer. Dutton and others (2001a) provide a good discussion of previous models of the High Plains Aquifer System and the Ogallala Aquifer. The following was taken from that report. \u201cFew regional aquifers have been as extensively studied as the Ogallala aquifer (e.g., see regional hydrogeologic summaries by Gutentag and others, 1984; Knowles and others, 1984; Nativ and Smith, 1987). \u2026 More than a dozen numerical groundwater flow models have been developed for different parts of the Ogallala aquifer in Texas ([Figure 3.2.1]). \u2026 Each of the Ogallala models has had a specific purpose, and each has associated strengths and weaknesses (Mace and Dutton, 1998). \u2026 Nine of the models are regional in extent ([Figure 3.2.1]b-f) and were developed by State and Federal agencies, including the Texas Water Development Board (TWDB), U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), and Bureau of Economic Geology (Mullican and others [1997]). Since its initial development (Knowles, 1981), the TWDB model has been updated and converted from PLASM (Prickett and Lonnquist, 1971) to MODFLOW (McDonald and Harbaugh, 1988). Several of the models are local or subregional in scope; three address water-resource issues for one or a few counties ([Figure 3.2.1]a). The Ogallala aquifer was included in another model (3 in ([Figure 3.2.1]a) used in a study of a salt-dissolution zone. Claborn and others (1970) at Texas Tech University, in cooperation with the High Plains Underground Water Conservation District No. 1, developed the first Ogallala aquifer model in Texas as a management tool (([Figure 3.2.1]a [1]). They used a polygonal finite- Final Conceptual Model Report for the High Plains Aquifer System Groundwater Availability Model 3.2-2 difference code developed by E. M. Weber of the California Department of Water Resources. They concluded that numerical models would be a valuable management tool for the aquifer but that high-quality data, especially accurate estimates of pumping, were lacking. Weaknesses of this model were its limited extent, limited calibration data, large block size, and artificial (nonhydrological) boundaries. Knowles (1981, 1984) and Knowles and others (1982, 1984) developed northern and southern models of the Ogallala aquifer (([Figure 3.2.1]b) for the TWDB using a modified PLASM code (Prickett and Lonnquist, 1971).

Weaknesses of this model were its limited extent, limited calibration data, large block size, and artificial (nonhydrological) boundaries. Knowles (1981, 1984) and Knowles and others (1982, 1984) developed northern and southern models of the Ogallala aquifer (([Figure 3.2.1]b) for the TWDB using a modified PLASM code (Prickett and Lonnquist, 1971). The division into two models minimized the number of blocks in each model to reduce computation time, reflecting the constraint of computing power, which was markedly less in 1984 than now. Model results showed that the groundwater supply would be inadequate by the year 2030, given projected demand. After about 10 years, Peckham and Ashworth (1993) audited the model results and adjusted the recharge rates and updated pumping rates. Dorman (1996) and Harkins (1998) converted the models to run using MODFLOW, a widely used code that has a number of user-friendly pre- and postprocessors. Additional changes were made to internally calculate pumping rate adjustments on the basis of transmissivity and saturated thickness. The revised models showed a slight increase in water availability, perhaps related to boundary conditions or to changes in projected demand, but they still predicted an overall decline in water levels from 1990 to 2040. Harkins (1998) noted that even reducing irrigation pumping by half, 10 counties in the southern model area were at risk to severely deplete the aquifer. The strengths of the TWDB models include parameters based on hydrogeologic data and updated estimates of recharge and pumping rates. Weaknesses include continued limitations of input data, artificial western and northern boundaries, unrealistic relationships between surface and groundwater, and relatively coarse grids (block width of 4.66 km). Furthermore, the conversion between PLASM and MODFLOW versions of the models is questionable because of how the artificial boundary along the state lines is treated. Final Conceptual Model Report for the High Plains Aquifer System Groundwater Availability Model 3.2-3 Luckey (1984) and Luckey and others (1986) developed models of the Ogallala aquifer as part of the USGS Regional Aquifer-System Analysis (RASA) program. The model for the southern and central parts of the U.S. High Plains includes the Ogallala aquifer in Texas ([Figure 3.2.1]c). The models use the code by Trescott and others (1976), modified by Larson (1978) and Luckey and others (1986), to improve control over iteration parameters and buffer change in transmissivity (i.e., saturated thickness) between iterations and to consider constant gradient boundary conditions for an unconfined aquifer. The models included estimated return flows from irrigation. Sensitivity analysis showed that estimates of recharge were highly dependent on assigned values of hydraulic conductivity. Drawdown of more than 100 ft (>30 m) between 1980 and 2020 was predicted. Luckey and Stephens (1987) revisited the southern model (([Figure 3.2.1]d) to determine the effect of reducing block width from 10 to 5 mi (~16 to ~8 km). The smaller block size resulted in small differences in predicted water levels but the same general conclusions. The USGS models include data based on hydrogeologic studies, consider return flow, and have natural boundaries. Weaknesses include how surface and groundwater are related and a very coarse grid. Luckey and Becker (1999) covered part of the area included in the central RASA model (compared ([Figure 3.2.1]c and ([Figure 3.2.1]f). That model has 6,000-ft (~1.8-km) block widths and a single layer and was updated with hydrogeologic data collected during the 1980\u2019s. Mullican and others (1997) investigated both the role of playas in recharging the Ogallala aquifer and advective movement of solutes. Their model was bounded to the north by a major river (([Figure 3.2.1]e). Block width was variable, ranging from 0.25 to 1 mi (~0.4 to ~1.6 km). The model was calibrated first for steady-state conditions and then for transient conditions through to 1990. Results showed that simulated water level was independent of spatial distribution of recharge in the model, whether focused at playas, distributed discretely through zones, or spread uniformly across the surface. The Mullican and others (1997) model includes a more realistic treatment of aquifer boundaries. Limitations of input data, especially transmissivity, are an inherent weakness of this model, as well as other models. Because the purpose of the model was to evaluate recharge scenarios and transport of contaminants, there are no predictions of water levels in response to future pumping. However, the Mullican and others (1997) model had to Final Conceptual Model Report for the High Plains Aquifer System Groundwater Availability Model 3.2-4 assign smaller pumping rates than those used by Knowles and others (1984), which caused excessive drawdown.\u201d Several numerical models of the Northern Ogallala Aquifer have been developed with MODFLOW for the purpose of assisting the Panhandle Regional Water Planning Area (RWPA) in assessing groundwater availability. They include the models of Dutton and others (2000, 2001a, 2001b), Dutton (2004), and INTERA and Dutton (2010) (Figure 3.2.1f). The first model of Dutton and others (2000, 2001b) and the recalibrated model of Dutton and others (2001a) were developed to replace a water-balance model previously used by the Panhandle Regional Water Planning Area. The numerical models provided a more accurate and precise method for estimating groundwater in each of the Region\u2019s counties based on predicted future pumping. Recalibration of the model occurred to improve the calibration in several counties within the Region. The TWDB adopted the Dutton and others (2001a) model as the groundwater availability model for the Northern Ogallala Aquifer. The model of Dutton and others (2001a) was updated by Dutton (2004) using modified parameters including adjustments to the base of the Ogallala Aquifer, adjustments to the assignment of recharge rates, adjustments to the parameters defining the MODFLOW drains and general head boundaries, and minor modifications to hydraulic conductivity. The purpose of the 2004 update was to improve the model calibration. The model was again updated in 2010 by INTERA and Dutton (2010) for the Panhandle Regional Water Planning"

The model of Dutton and others (2001a) was updated by Dutton (2004) using modified parameters including adjustments to the base of the Ogallala Aquifer, adjustments to the assignment of recharge rates, adjustments to the parameters defining the MODFLOW drains and general head boundaries, and minor modifications to hydraulic conductivity. The purpose of the 2004 update was to improve the model calibration. The model was again updated in 2010 by INTERA and Dutton (2010) for the Panhandle Regional Water Planning Area. The purpose of the 2010 update was to incorporate revised model parameters and pumping estimates in order to support planning activities in the 2011 planning cycle. The specific revisions included (1) addition of historical pumping data from 1999 through 2008 and revised future demand estimates through 2060, (2) incorporation of additional data on aquifer properties including hydraulic conductivity, elevation of the base of the Ogallala Aquifer, and specific yield, and (3) incorporation of research on recharge rates in the region that occurred after development of the Dutton (2004) model. Three models designed to assess groundwater availability have been developed for the southern portion of the Ogallala Aquifer. The model by Stovall (2001) and Stovall and others (2001) was developed for the Llano Estacado Regional Water Planning Area to use as a management tool and Final Conceptual Model Report for the High Plains Aquifer System Groundwater Availability Model 3.2-5 assess groundwater resources in the 21 counties comprising that area (Figure 3.2.1d). The basis for that model was the model of Harkins and others (1998), but it included some significant changes to the model grid, domain, and boundary conditions; model parameters; and initial conditions. Blandford and others (2003) developed a groundwater availability model of the southern portion of the Ogallala Aquifer for the TWDB (Figure 3.2.2). Their model differs from previous models of the Southern Ogallala Aquifer in that it uses (1) a finer grid, (2) hydraulic conductivity data from interpretations of specific-capacity tests, (3) newly estimated detailed irrigation pumping for 1982 through 1997, and (4) refined inputs for the New Mexico portion of the model. The groundwater availability model of Blandford and others (2003) was updated in conjunction with development of the groundwater availability model of the Edwards-Trinity (High Plains) Aquifer by Blandford and others (2008). They included both aquifers in their model because they are hydraulically connected in some regions. Changes were made in the updated model to improve or maintain calibration for the Ogallala Aquifer. These changes included \u201cselected adjustments to agricultural pumping, some updates to City of Lubbock historical pumping, and some updates to post-development recharge in the vicinity of Lubbock\u201d (Blandford and others, 2008). Two models of the High Plains Aquifer System have been developed which focus on portions of New Mexico (Musharrafieh and Chudnoff, 1999; Musharrafieh and Logan, 1999). The extents of these models, which were developed by the New Mexico Office of the State Engineer, are illustrated in Figure 3.2.1g. Both models use a single layer to represent the High Plains Aquifer System, which includes portions of the Dockum Aquifer that are hydraulically connected to the overlying Ogallala Aquifer. Senger and others (1987) developed a two-dimensional, cross- section model of the Palo Duro Basin (Figure 3.2.1g). Their model extended from ground surface to the base of the basement aquiclude underlying the Deep-Basin Brine Aquifer and explicitly included the Dockum Group. The purpose of their modeling was to \"characterize regional ground-water flow paths as well as to investigate causes of underpressuring below the evaporite aquitard, to evaluate mechanisms of recharge and discharge to and from the Deep- Basin Brine Aquifer, and to examine transient effects of erosion and hydrocarbon production\". Earlier modeling of the Palo Duro Basin by INTERA (1984) and Wironjanagud and others (1986) combined the Ogallala Formation and Dockum Group into a single model layer. Based on observed head differences between these two units, Senger and others (1987) separated the Final Conceptual Model Report for the High Plains Aquifer System Groundwater Availability Model 3.2-6 Ogallala Formation and Dockum Group into individual layers in an effort to reproduce the observed head differences. Although the Dockum Group was included, the major focus of the modeling presented in Senger and others (1987) was the Permian evaporite aquitard, a potential host strata for a high-level nuclear waste disposal site during the 1980s, and the underlying Deep-Basin Brine Aquifer. 3.2.2 Rita Blanca Aquifer Models While portions of the Rita Blanca Aquifer hydraulically connected to the overlying Ogallala Aquifer have been included in previous regional models of the High Plains Aquifer System, it is not generally treated as a separate aquifer. For example, the groundwater availability model of the Northern Ogallala Aquifer developed by Dutton and others (2001a) incorporated all sediments from the surface to the top of the Dockum Group. Therefore, portions of the Rita Blanca Aquifer were included in that model by default. However, the Rita Blanca Aquifer was not analyzed as a unique aquifer but, rather, treated as part of the Ogallala Aquifer. An independent groundwater availability model of the Rita Blanca Aquifer has not been developed. 3.2.3 Edwards-Trinity (High Plains) Aquifer Models Blandford and others (2008) state the following regarding modeling of the Edwards-Trinity (High Plains) Aquifer prior to their work. \u201cNo previous comprehensive modeling studies have been completed for the Edwards- Trinity (High Plains) Aquifer. Previous modeling studies that encompass the aquifer (e.g., Luckey and others, 1986; Knowles and others, 1984; Peckham and Ashworth, 1993; Stovall and others, 2001; Blandford and others, 2003) focused primarily on the Ogallala Aquifer and have only considered the Edwards-Trinity (High Plains) Aquifer (1) where the uppermost permeable portions of the Edwards-Trinity (High Plains) Aquifer are in direct hydraulic communication with saturated Ogallala sediments (e.g. Gaines County) or (2) where Ogallala sediments are not saturated and the water table lies within permeable Cretaceous sediments that underlie the Ogallala Formation. This latter scenario is prevalent along the southern and southeastern"

This latter scenario is prevalent along the southern and southeastern margin of the Southern High Plains (Blandford and Blazer, 2004).\u201d Final Conceptual Model Report for the High Plains Aquifer System Groundwater Availability Model 3.2-7 Therefore, the groundwater availability model of the Edwards-Trinity (High Plains) Aquifer developed by Blandford and others (2008) was the first model to focus on and simulate the entire aquifer. 3.2.4 Dockum Aquifer Models Portions of the Dockum Aquifer hydraulically connected to the overlying Ogallala Aquifer were included in previous regional models of the High Plains Aquifer System. The Dockum Aquifer was also explicitly incorporated into the cross-section model of Senger and others (1987), but was not the focus of their model. The first three-dimensional numerical model focused on only the Dockum Aquifer in Texas is the groundwater availability model of Ewing and others (2008), the boundary of which is shown in Figure 3.2.2. This model was developed using MODFLOW 2000 and consists of three layers. The upper layer rudimentarily represents the Ogallala Aquifer and other younger sediments overlying the Dockum Aquifer through general-head boundaries applied to the layer. The Dockum Aquifer was modeled as two layers with model layer 2 representing the upper portion of the Dockum Aquifer and model layer 3 representing the lower portion of the Dockum Aquifer. The model was calibrated for two time periods, one representing steady-state conditions and the other representing transient conditions. A sensitivity analysis was performed to determine which parameters have the most influence on model performance and calibration. A recalibration of this model by the TWDB is documented in Oliver and Hutchinson (2010). A local-scale model of the Dockum and Edwards-Trinity (Plateau) aquifers was conducted by HDR Engineering (2009) for the Brazos G Water Planning Group in Mitchell and Nolan counties, Texas (see Figure 3.2.2). The purpose of that model was to develop \u201ca tool to evaluate groundwater supplies in western Nolan and eastern Mitchell counties\u201d and focuses on the city of Sweetwater\u2019s Champion well field. The model was calibrated to steady-state and transient conditions. Verification of the model was conducted along with several predictive simulations for the time period 2008 to 2060. 3.2.5 Key Model Improvements The groundwater availability model for the High Plains Aquifer System aims to both incorporate and improve upon the work done in previous models. To that purpose, it will integrate the most Final Conceptual Model Report for the High Plains Aquifer System Groundwater Availability Model 3.2-8 recent MODFLOW numerical groundwater availability models prepared for aquifers in the High Plains Aquifer System. These models include the INTERA and Dutton (2010) update of the Northern Ogallala Aquifer groundwater availability model, the Blandford and others (2008) groundwater availability model of the Edwards-Trinity (High Plains) and Southern Ogallala aquifers, and the Ewing and others (2008) groundwater availability model of the Dockum Aquifer. The purpose of combining these existing models into one consistent multi-aquifer groundwater availability model is to provide a resource for making water planning decisions based on the entire aquifer system rather than just isolated aquifers. For example, cross- formational flow is an important consideration in the process of deciding Desired Future Conditions. The High Plains Aquifer System groundwater availability model will provide a valuable framework for making those decisions that existing models cannot provide. In addition to consolidating all available information from existing models, the current model also aims to improve upon existing datasets by adding new information where available. The current model develops an improved and more consistent hydrostratigraphic framework based on new structural picks from logs in the TWDB Brackish Resources Aquifer Characterization System database and provided by Groundwater Conservation Districts in the study area, including the High Plains Water District, the Panhandle Groundwater Conservation District, and the North Plains Groundwater Conservation District (see Section 4.2). The current model also seeks to improve on existing historical pumping estimates, since these are often an uncertain but vital element of groundwater availability models. For this reason, streamlined tools were created for estimating historical pumping estimates (see Section 4.7), incorporating new information from Groundwater Conservation Districts and utilizing more consistent methodology. The current model also attempts to improve the implementation of recharge in a way that more accurately reflects the local environmental differences apparent across the region. The current model considers a variety of factors, including soil characteristics, chloride mass balance information, and nitrate measurements to adjust recharge on a more localized level (see Section 4.4). This methodology also allows a more in-depth analysis of irrigation return flow, which has not been addressed in detail by previous regional groundwater availability models.

Final Conceptual Model Report for the High Plains Aquifer System Groundwater Availability Model 4.1-1 4.0 Hydrologic Setting 4.1 Hydrostratigraphy The geologic formations in the High Plains Aquifer System are grouped into four hydrostratigraphic units that define the model layers (Table 4.1.1). The aquifer system as a whole ranges from 0 to 3,105 feet in thickness and has an average thickness of 910 feet. The aquifer system is thickest in the south and thinnest in the Canadian River valley and along the eastern margin (Figure 4.1.1). Thickening and thinning are mostly related to subsidence and uplift, respectively, of the underlying Permian surface. Regional schematic cross sections, which are based on our geophysical log correlations, show thickness variations in the hydrostratigraphic layers of the High Plains Aquifer System. Figure 4.1.2 shows the location of the regional cross sections, which are shown in Figures 4.1.3 and 4.1.4. While the hydrostratigraphy of the Dockum Group is quite complex, a common approach divides it into upper and lower units. The lower Dockum Group is more extensive than the upper Dockum Group (Figures 4.1.3 and 4.1.4). The upper Dockum Aquifer is entirely confined except for small surface exposures along the western margin of the High Plains Aquifer System. The lower Dockum Aquifer is mostly confined except for surface exposures in the Canadian River Valley and in the southeast (see Figure 2.2.1). Both Dockum Group layers are composed of complexly interbedded sandstone and shale, although in general, both are sandier in their lower parts (see Figure 2.2.4). Cretaceous (and minor Jurassic) formations overlie the Dockum Group across large parts of the High Plains Aquifer System. In the northwest, the Rita Blanca Aquifer overlies the upper Dockum Aquifer and is overlain by the Ogallala Aquifer (Figure 4.1.3). The Rita Blanca Aquifer is composed of complexly interbedded sandstones and shales. The Rita Blanca Aquifer is exposed at the surface locally in northeast New Mexico and is in hydraulic communication with the overlying Ogallala Aquifer in Dallam County, Texas (Christian, 1989). The Rita Blanca, Edwards-Trinity (High Plains), and Edwards-Trinity (Plateau) aquifers are all at the same hydrostratigraphic level (Table 4.1.1), but are separated geographically from each other by many miles (see Figure 2.0.2) and are not in contact with each other (see Figure 4.1.3). The Edwards-Trinity (High Plains) aquifer is generally composed of sandstone overlain by limestone overlain by clay/shale. However, there are some portions of the aquifer where either the Final Conceptual Model Report for the High Plains Aquifer System Groundwater Availability Model 4.1-2 limestone layer is absent (northwestern portion of the aquifer) or the clay/shale layer is absent (southern and far eastern portion of the aquifer). Where the shale layer is present, it generally serves as a confining unit for the lower layers of the aquifer (Blandford and others, 2008). The Edwards-Trinity (Plateau) Aquifer overlies the Dockum Aquifer and generally comprises limestone underlain by sandstone. In areas where it is overlain by either the Pecos Valley or Ogallala aquifers, the Edwards-Trinity (Plateau) Aquifer is hydraulically connected to these aquifers (Anaya and Jones, 2009). Tertiary and Quaternary formations form the upper layer of the High Plains Aquifer System (Table 4.1.1). The Ogallala and Pecos Valley aquifers, which are both composed primarily of unconsolidated sand, gravel, and clay, are at the same hydrostratigraphic level and contact each other (Meyer and others, 2012). This uppermost layer is entirely unconfined and overlies various other layers depending on location (see Figures 4.1.3 and 4.1.4). The Ogallala Aquifer layer is mostly separated into northern and southern parts by the Canadian River valley. The Pecos Valley and Edwards-Trinity (Plateau) aquifers overlie the Dockum Aquifer in portions of the study area to the south, so structural tops and bottoms for these aquifers were determined where the Dockum Aquifer exists. However, because the Pecos Valley and Edwards-Trinity (Plateau) aquifers are not explicitly modeled in the High Plains Aquifer System groundwater availability model, lithology was not determined for these aquifers.

Final Conceptual Model Report for the High Plains Aquifer System Groundwater Availability Model 4.2-1 4.2 Hydrostratigraphic Framework The structure of the Permian surface forms a large subsidence basin, which is filled by the formations of the High Plains Aquifer System. Superimposed on this greater Permian Basin are smaller basins and uplifted areas (see Figures 2.2.2 and 4.1.1). High Plains Aquifer System layer thicknesses are clearly related to Permian structural features, filling subsidence basins and thinning over uplifted areas and, subsequently, during the Tertiary, the entire region was tilted eastward and southward (Figures 4.1.3 and 4.1.4). This section describes the structural surfaces and lithologies of each hydrostratigraphic layer as determined by geophysical log analysis. 4.2.1 Data Sources Geophysical well logs were used to correlate formation boundaries and estimate lithology thicknesses. Large amounts of time and effort were spent up front searching for and evaluating the quality of well logs. Due to the variety of log sources and the large amount of older and low- image-quality logs, an extensive depth calibration process was undertaken to ensure vertical consistency between logs. Essentially, the depth calibration process assigned the geophysical log image to an actual x,y,z point in real space. The resulting depth-calibrated logs can subsequently be \u201chung\u201d on cross-sections and correlated with each other. In addition to depth calibrating all of the logs, ones that appeared compressed or stretched vertically were resized to match the actual depth values written on the log file. The final database includes 2,050 well logs (Figure 4.2.1). Sources of well logs were the TWDB\u2019s Brackish Resources Aquifer Characterization System database, the Bureau of Economic Geology Geophysical Log Facility, commercial suppliers, the Railroad Commission of Texas (recently drilled wells), the University of Texas Lands Office, the New Mexico Oil Conservation Division, the City of Amarillo, and the City of Canyon. All of the geophysical logs have gamma-ray curves and most also have resistivity curves. Some logs have sonic or neutron curves instead of resistivity curves. Most logs were run in oil and gas wells, but 31 logs were run in water wells. The well log database is primarily composed of electronic image (TIFF) files. We prepared and interpreted logs and displayed results using commercially available Petra software (IHS, Inc.). Petra is a GIS-type program that specializes in spatial data from wells. Although the image files are just pictures of well logs, the depth- calibration process in Petra allows us to associate these images with actual elevation and depth Final Conceptual Model Report for the High Plains Aquifer System Groundwater Availability Model 4.2-2 values. Structural and lithologic interpretations were made directly on the corrected images and these elevation, depth, and thickness picks were automatically saved in the main Petra database. The geophysical log database also includes digital gamma-ray and resistivity curves for 108 wells. Digital logs are electronic files of quantified log responses recorded every half foot of depth. Information can be extracted wholesale from digital logs without painstaking visual examination. Most of the digital log locations are plotted on the cross sections in Figure 4.2.1. 4.2.2 Geophysical Log Analysis To correlate formation boundaries between wells and to estimate lithology, we used all available log curves, although gamma-ray curves provided the most information. The gamma-ray curve graphs the amount of natural radiation at a given depth. Nuclear decay of uranium, thorium, and potassium are the major sources of natural gamma radiation in rocks and sediments. Potassium- bearing clay produces more gamma radiation than does quartz sand. Although other variables, such as uranium minerals and potassium feldspars, complicate the clay/sand control on gamma radiation, the gamma-ray curve is still the main geophysical log for estimating lithology in west Texas. Meyer and others (2012) present a good explanation of the use of gamma-ray logs, covering their strengths and weaknesses. The main drawbacks of gamma-ray logs are cased hole recordings, incomplete coverage of shallow intervals, and uncalibrated, nonstandardized results. Gamma radiation is attenuated when recorded through cement casing, and the casing itself may produce variable radiation, further obscuring real rock signals. Most wells are not logged completely to surface, although we were careful to include in our final database the shallowest logs available: 1,560 of our logs extend to within 50 feet of the surface, and 963 of those extend to the surface. Nonstandard gamma recording instruments used over 70 years makes it difficult to calibrate responses or to compare them between wells. Resistivity logs respond mainly to compositional variations in pore fluids. Resistivity logs measure resistance to an induced electrical current. Resistivity is the inverse of conductivity, which is commonly measured in groundwater samples. Freshwater is more resistive than saline water, and oil is more resistive than water. However, lithology and porosity also influence resistivity response. Clay minerals are less resistive than quartz or calcite because of free electric charges on their surfaces. Permeable sandstone is less resistive than impermeable limestone. We attempted to use resistivity"

However, lithology and porosity also influence resistivity response. Clay minerals are less resistive than quartz or calcite because of free electric charges on their surfaces. Permeable sandstone is less resistive than impermeable limestone. We attempted to use resistivity logs for water quality mapping but were unable to confidently interpret a sufficient coverage of logs for meaningful mapping. In general, Dockum Group Final Conceptual Model Report for the High Plains Aquifer System Groundwater Availability Model 4.2-3 sandstones display low resistivities and Ogallala Formation sandstones display high resistivities, but mappable patterns were not evident. The resistivity/water quality relationship has been used successfully in the Gulf Coast and east Texas (Collier, 1993). West Texas formations, however, have more complex lithologies, and west Texas well loggers employ different logging practices. Unlike gamma-ray logs, resistivity logs are not run in cased holes, which limits the available database. Only 732 resistivity logs were available for analysis. 4.2.3 Surface Correlation We used standard well log correlation techniques to identify formation boundaries (surfaces) on every log. In the High Plains Aquifer System, model layers coincide with geologic formations (Table 4.1.1). Fortunately, the stratigraphy of these formations has been well defined by both surface (outcrop) and subsurface studies. Previous subsurface studies were based on either water well drillers\u2019 logs or geophysical logs. Drillers\u2019 logs are well sample descriptions. The main advantage of using drillers\u2019 log data is the high density of available logs. Seni (1980), for example, used over 15,000 drillers\u2019 logs to map the Ogallala Formation. The main disadvantage of drillers\u2019 logs is that they are not correlatable between wells in the same way that geophysical logs are. Geophysical logs are continuous records of vertical changes in multiple rock and fluid properties. Many of these vertical property changes reflect subtle horizontal layering, which is continuous laterally on scales of a few feet to many miles. This layering can be correlated between wells by matching similar patterns in log curves. In this study, gamma-ray curves and resistivity curves were most useful for correlation. Correlation allows us to trace formations from wells in which tops are known to wells in which they are not yet established. The geophysical log correlation process starts with documenting tops on specific logs and confirming that these tops are generally agreed as correct. We used several published sets of cross sections in which log curves are shown (Granata, 1981; Bebout and Meador, 1985; McGookey and others, 1988) (Figure 4.2.2). Ashworth and Christian (1989) present additional reference logs for the southeast part of the study area. These reference geophysical logs cover all of the formations in the High Plains Aquifer System. We then correlated tops from reference logs through all of the logs in our database. The process was iterated until a best fit was established. We supplemented reference logs with additional studies in which formations are precisely defined. Broadhead (1984) and Holbrook and Dunbar (1992) define the Jurassic and Cretaceous formations of the Rita Blanca Aquifer. Cronin (1969), Seni (1980), and Knowles and Final Conceptual Model Report for the High Plains Aquifer System Groundwater Availability Model 4.2-4 others (1984) present excellent maps of Ogallala Formation surfaces, thicknesses, and lithologies. Cretaceous Edwards-Trinity formations are shown on maps and schematic cross sections in Walker (1979), Barker and Ardis (1992, 1996), and Blandford and others (2008). Meyer and others (2012) document Pecos Valley Alluvium stratigraphy, and we used their Brackish Resources Aquifer Characterization System database as the standard for this formation. 4.2.4 Lithology Estimation For lithology estimation we calibrated gamma-ray logs using well sample descriptions. Johns (1989) described continuous drill cores through the Dockum Aquifer from four wells in the north (Figure 4.2.2). Seni (1980), Knowles and others (1984), and Blandford and others (2008) used well sample descriptions from drillers\u2019 logs to construct detailed lithology maps. Granata (1981) used the basic relationship between gamma radiation and lithology to map sandstone in the lower and upper Dockum Group. Based on these studies, we calibrated our gamma-ray logs in two ways. First, we made direct comparisons where both sample descriptions and corresponding gamma-ray logs are published (Johns, 1989). The second calibration process involved projecting interpolated sample data into our gamma-ray logs. Seni (1980), Knowles and others (1984), and Blandford and others (2008) used sample descriptions from thousands of water wells. We digitized contour maps from their publications of percent and net thickness of sandstone and limestone and made ArcGIS raster grids from the digital contours. We then used Petra to project values from the grids into each well location. This method provided lithology values that are based primarily on data from nearby drillers\u2019 logs. Separately, we estimated lithology directly from the gamma-ray logs using the methodology of Granata (1981) and Meyer and others (2012). We made final lithology estimations for each log based on comparisons of the two independent values within the context of surrounding values. We favored drillers\u2019 log data in shallow formations where gamma-ray logs are typically run through casing, but favored gamma- ray log data in deeper formations where gamma-ray logs are typically run in open holes. Digital gamma-ray and resistivity curves facilitate the lithology calibration process and provide an excellent way to visualize results. Lithology from gamma-ray logs mainly involves setting a specific value (cut-off value) to separate sand-dominated intervals from clay-dominated intervals (Granata, 1981; Meyer and others, 2012). Because gamma-ray recordings are nonstandard between wells, the sand/clay cut-off value is usually determined individually for each log. Digital logs, however, can be normalized so that values are more comparable, and logs can be Final Conceptual Model Report for the High Plains Aquifer System Groundwater Availability Model 4.2-5 processed in batch. We normalized cased hole"

We normalized cased hole intervals separately from open hole intervals. First, we normalized gamma-ray values to a common mean value and then normalized to a common range of values. Resistivity logs, which were not used for lithology determination, were normalized to a common range of values. We used Petra to construct cross sections, showing log curves and color-coded lithologies. Petra determines vertical distribution of sandstones, shales, and limestones based strictly on foot-by-foot comparison of log value to cut- off value. We repeated the process using various cut-off values until the distribution of lithologies as visualized on cross sections agreed reasonably well with both drillers\u2019 log data and gamma radiation principles. Lessons learned from digital log calibration were applied to the image logs, which had to be analyzed individually. We constructed seven west-to-east digital log cross sections (Figure 4.2.1). These structural cross sections show the hydrostratigraphic layers of the High Plains Aquifer System relative to height in feet above mean sea level. Correlation log curves and lithologies are also shown. At each well location, gamma-ray curves are displayed on the left and resistivity curves, where available, are displayed on the right (Figures 4.2.3 through 4.2.9). 4.2.5 Spatial Interpolation of Geophysical Log Analyses The results of the correlations described in the previous section provide estimates of the top and base of each aquifer at the geophysical log locations shown in Figure 4.2.1. These point values were interpolated to create regional surfaces for the active extent of each aquifer. 4.2.5.1 Workflow for Creating Surfaces The interpolations were performed under the following rules: 1. The surfaces should match the values at control points as closely as possible, within the constraints of the interpolation method. 2. The surfaces should intersect land surface at outcrop edges, as previously defined by the surface geology. This is primarily achieved by adding control points along the boundary that were sampled to land surface based on the digital elevation model. 3. Aquifers with subsurface pinchouts (for example, the Edwards-Trinity (High Plains) and Rita Blanca aquifers) should smoothly thin to the edge of their defined active area. This was primarily achieved by adding control points along the aquifer boundary sampled to the bottom of the overlying aquifer. Final Conceptual Model Report for the High Plains Aquifer System Groundwater Availability Model 4.2-6 4. The surfaces should not contain inversions (that is, points where an aquifer thickness is negative based on the top and bottom elevations). This might occur along edges or in thin areas where insufficient control is available. The interpolations were completed using automated techniques (that is, no hand-contouring was required) and, thus, is completely reproducible. The end-to-end process used a series of Python scripts based on ArcGIS 10.1 libraries (including the Spatial Analyst extension). 4.2.5.2 Supplemental Data The interpolations were first completed using only the results of the geophysical log analyses. After satisfactory surfaces were created, we then explored using additional data sources to refine the surface of the base of Ogallala Aquifer in areas between geophysical logs. These data sources were primarily from existing studies that had utilized driller\u2019s logs. While we consider the geophysical log analysis to be the \u201cgold standard\u201d for setting the regional structure, the additional drillers\u2019 log data could be used to increase resolution, as long as the supplemental data did not violate the character of the regional trends. Seven supplemental data sources were considered: 1. Estimates of \u201credbed\u201d from the Panhandle Groundwater Conservation District, provided as part of the District\u2019s database (Panhandle Groundwater Conservation District, 2013). 2. Estimates of \u201credbed\u201d from North Plains Groundwater Conservation District, provided as part of the Northern Ogallala Aquifer groundwater availability model update (INTERA, Inc., and Dutton, 2010). 3. Estimates of the base of the Ogallala Aquifer from a five-county study performed for High Plains Water District (Daniel B. Stephens and Associates, 2012). 4. Estimates of \u201credbed\u201d from Hemphill County UWCD (Hemphill County Underground Water Conservation District, 2013). 5. Estimates of the base of the Ogallala Aquifer from a study of Lipscomb County (Daniel B. Stephens and Associates, 2013). 6. Estimate of the base of the Ogallala Formation based on Seni (1980), primarily in Randall County and the surrounding area. Final Conceptual Model Report for the High Plains Aquifer System Groundwater Availability Model 4.2-7 7. Estimate of the base of the Ogallala Aquifer from previous Southern Ogallala Aquifer groundwater availability model (Blandford and others, 2003) with minor modifications by High Plains Water District staff (High Plains Water District, 2013). The location of these data sources are shown in Figure 4.2.10. In integrating this supplemental data, we performed a spatial query that excluded those data within 10,000 feet of an existing geophysical log, so that the surface would not be affected near the geophysical log. We then performed the interpolation with the supplemental data to produce a new surface. The new surface was compared to the original surface (based solely on the geophysical log data) to make sure that deviations (1) were equally distributed around the original surface (that is, no consistent bias was evident) and (2) the geophysical log values were still honored to the extent possible based on the interpolation method. 4.2.5.3 Interpolation Results The interpolated base of the Ogallala and Pecos Valley aquifers is shown in Figure 4.2.11.

A comparison of the elevation interpolated solely from geophysical logs (Figure 4.2.12a) and with adjustments from the supplemental data (Figure 4.2.12b) clearly shows increased resolution due to the supplemental data. The remaining basal surfaces are shown in Figure 4.2.13 through 4.2.15. Estimates of thickness were calculated for each aquifer based on subtraction of the elevation grids. Aquifer thickness maps are shown in Figures 4.2.16 through 4.2.19. Regional cross sections were created by extracting elevation values from the final surfaces along the lines shown in Figure 4.1.2. These cross sections are shown in Figures 4.2.20 and 4.2.21, and are analogous to Figures 4.1.3 and 4.1.4. While the cross sections created from the interpolated surfaces are smoother between the control points (and show variations due to influence from other nearby control points) the character of the cross sections is very similar, confirming that the interpolated surfaces honor the geologic correlations. Sand fraction maps were also created by interpolating the point estimates from the geophysical log analyses. The approach for this interpolation was much more straightforward, using a simple kriging approach and clipping the sand fraction rasters to the active boundary for each aquifer. The sand fraction maps are shown in Figures 4.2.22 through 4.2.25. Net sand thickness maps were calculated by multiplying the sand fraction maps by the aquifer thickness maps. The net sand thickness maps are shown in Figures 4.2.26 through 4.2.29. Using the same methodology, Final Conceptual Model Report for the High Plains Aquifer System Groundwater Availability Model 4.2-8 a limestone fraction map and net limestone thickness map were created for the Edwards-Trinity (High Plains) Aquifer (Figures 4.2.30 and 4.2.31). 4.2.6 Discussion This section describes the results of the geophysical log study for each hydrostratigraphic layer. Permian fine-grained formations underlie aquifer and aquitard layers and form a no-flow lower boundary to the High Plains Aquifer System. Lower and upper Dockum Group layers are composed of interbedded sandstones and shales and display significant lateral variation in sandstone development. The Dockum Group layers form the thickest part of the aquifer system. The Ogallala Aquifer layer is thinner but sandier than either Dockum Group layer. Sandstone, although thin, is present consistently at the base of the Edwards-Trinity (High Plains) Aquifer layer. The Rita Blanca Aquifer layer is composed of thin sandstones and shales in Texas. Lithologies were not mapped for the Edwards-Trinity (Plateau) Aquifer layer or the Pecos Valley Aquifer layer. The Permian layer is composed of red-bed shales (high gamma ray) and limestones, dolomites, and evaporites (low gamma ray). Some Permian formations include high-salinity aquifers, but these layers are deeper and are not in hydraulic communication with Dockum Group sandstones (Bebout and Meador, 1985; McGookey and others, 1988). We picked top of Permian (base of Dockum Group) operationally as the base of the lowest sandy interval in the Dockum Group (Santa Rosa Sandstone) (see Figures 4.2.3 through 4.2.9). Some of the redbeds below the Santa Rosa Sandstone may be Triassic in age, but they are not part of the High Plains Aquifer System. The lower Dockum Aquifer layer is generally sandiest near the base. The Santa Rosa Sandstone appears as a low gamma-ray interval on most geophysical logs (see Figures 4.2.3 through 4.2.9). Other sandstones are scattered throughout the lower Dockum Group layer above the Santa Rosa Sandstone. The lower Dockum Group is thickest in a central area that defines the Dockum Basin (see Figure 4.2.19). Sandstones, however, are more concentrated around the margins of the Dockum Basin (see Figures 4.2.25 and 4.2.29). The lower Dockum Aquifer displays relatively low sandstone in and north of the Canadian River valley. High sandstone percentages are present in the lower Dockum Group under the Edwards-Trinity (Plateau) Aquifer layer and the Pecos Valley Aquifer layer in the south. Final Conceptual Model Report for the High Plains Aquifer System Groundwater Availability Model 4.2-9 The upper Dockum Group layer is less consistently sandy at its base than is the lower Dockum Group. Basal sandstones in the upper Dockum Group are best developed in western areas and under the Edwards-Trinity (High Plains) Aquifer layer (see Figures 4.2.3 through 4.2.9). The upper Dockum Group is segmented by postdepositional erosion into two separate areas (Figure 4.2.18). Unlike the lower Dockum Group, the upper Dockum Group is sandiest in basin center areas (see Figures 4.2.24 and 4.2.28). Thick sandstones coincide generally with the thickest parts of the layer. The Rita Blanca Aquifer layer is present only in the northwest corner of the study area. The Rita Blanca Aquifer thins from west to east and pinches out in Dallam and Hartley counties (see Figures 4.2.3 and 4.2.17). The Rita Blanca Aquifer is composed of interbedded sandstones and shales, which are distributed randomly and lack distinctive vertical trends. Minor limestone beds are also present. The net sandstone thickness reaches 250 feet in New Mexico but is generally less than 100 feet in Texas (Figure 4.2.27). Percent sandstone also decreases eastward into Texas before increasing again near the pinchout line (see Figure 4.2.23). The Edwards-Trinity (High Plains) Aquifer layer is the only layer that includes thick limestone. The Edwards-Trinity (High Plains) Aquifer, which is an erosional remnant of more extensive Cretaceous formations to the southeast (Edwards-Trinity (Plateau) Aquifer), is thickest in its central part (Figure 4.2.17). Sandstones, however, are generally more abundant in peripheral areas (Figures 4.2.23 and 4.2.27). Sandstones in the Antlers and Walnut formations consistently form the base of this layer, and limestones (Comanche Peak and Edwards formations) directly overlie sandstones in many locations (Figures 4.2.6 and 4.2.7). Limestones are thickest in the east and thin to zero thickness near the Texas/New Mexico border (Figures 4.2.30"

Limestones are thickest in the east and thin to zero thickness near the Texas/New Mexico border (Figures 4.2.30 and 4.2.31). The upper part of the layer is mainly shale, which is overlain by Ogallala Aquifer sand and gravel. The Ogallala Aquifer layer is the sandiest layer in the High Plains Aquifer System. Drillers\u2019 logs show that the Ogallala Aquifer includes abundant coarse sand and gravel and is unconsolidated (Seni, 1980). The Ogallala Aquifer is distinctly thicker in the north than in the south (see Figure 4.2.16). Three major paleovalleys are located in the north, and salt dissolution depressions are more common there. Thickest net sand is also concentrated in the north (Figure 4.2.26). High sand percent areas are present within the northern paleovalleys, in New Final Conceptual Model Report for the High Plains Aquifer System Groundwater Availability Model 4.2-10 Mexico (closer to source areas), and along the south margin of the layer (Figure 4.2.22). The high sand area in the south is an erosional remnant of another paleovalley. The Ogallala Aquifer generally causes low gamma-ray and high resistivity responses on geophysical logs. The lower part of the Ogallala Aquifer is typically sandier than the upper part, although many logs show it to be sandy throughout (Figures 4.2.3 through 4.2.9). The Ogallala Aquifer interval is commonly cased with cement before running logs, and cased hole gamma-ray logs are not reliable indicators of lithology. Cross sections 1 through 4, however, include a number of open- hole logs through the Ogallala Aquifer, which accurately record lithology in those areas.

Final Conceptual Model Report for the High Plains Aquifer System Groundwater Availability Model 4.3-1 4.3 Water Levels and Groundwater Flow Water-level data were collected for the High Plains Aquifer System groundwater availability model study area in order to estimate pre-development groundwater flow, estimate historical water-level surfaces and historical water-level declines, evaluate the transient behavior of water levels observed in wells, and identify water-level calibration targets for the model. The following subsections provide the sources used to collect water-level data in the active model area, discuss and present an estimate of pre-development water levels, discuss available transient water-level data and present an analysis of selected transient data throughout the active model area, present estimated water-level surfaces, and discuss water-level calibration targets. A summary of available literature data on cross-formational flow between the aquifers in the High Plains Aquifer System is provided in the last subsection. 4.3.1 Data Sources Water-level data were obtained from the TWDB groundwater database (TWDB, 2013a), several Groundwater Conservation Districts within the active model area, and the United States Geological Survey online data (United States Geological Survey, 2013b). The TWDB groundwater database (TWDB, 2013a) was queried to obtain the available water-level data for the Texas counties in the active model area. All data identified as publishable and not affected by pumping were collected. Water-level data were obtained from the following Groundwater Conservation Districts: \uf0b7 Hemphill County Underground Water District. \uf0b7 Mesa Underground Water Conservation District. \uf0b7 North Plains Groundwater Conservation District. \uf0b7 Permian Basin Underground Water Conservation District. \uf0b7 Panhandle Groundwater Conservation District. \uf0b7 South Plains Underground Water Conservation District. Care was taken to eliminate duplicate measurements in the data from the Groundwater Conservation Districts and the TWDB groundwater database. In addition, data from both sources for a well were integrated. All water-level data received from the Mesa Underground Water Conservation District, the North Plains Groundwater Conservation District, and the Final Conceptual Model Report for the High Plains Aquifer System Groundwater Availability Model 4.3-2 Permian Basin Underground Water Conservation District were found to be duplicated in the TWDB groundwater database. Water-level data for New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Kansas were obtained from the United States Geological Survey groundwater data for the nation available online (United States Geological Survey, 2013b). Historical groundwater data through the late 1990s were compiled from the previous groundwater availability models of the individual aquifers in the High Plains Aquifer System. However, the decision was made that those data would not be used and supplemented with data since the late 1990s to complete the groundwater data set used for the High Plains Aquifer System groundwater availability model. The reasons for making this decision included the following: \uf0b7 Based on personal communication with TWDB staff responsible for maintaining the TWDB groundwater database, which is the primary source of water-level data, reconciliation of the database was conducted around early 2013 to try to eliminate inaccurate water levels or water levels with no confidence (Hopkins, 2013). Because of this reconciliation process and the removal of data from the database by TWDB staff, recompiling the water-level data from the TWDB groundwater database was considered to provide a more accurate data set than using the historically compiled data. In addition, the effort required to recompile the water-level data was considered to be less than the effort that would have been required to reconcile the historically compiled data with the revised content of the TWDB groundwater database. \uf0b7 Likewise, recompiling water-level data from Groundwater Conservation Districts was considered to require less effort than determining which Groundwater Conservation District data were and were not included in the historically compiled data and enabled control in eliminating duplicate measurements with data in the TWDB groundwater database. There are five water-bearing units of interest in the High Plains Aquifer System: the Ogallala Aquifer, the Rita Blanca Aquifer, the Edwards-Trinity (High Plains) Aquifer, the upper portion of the Dockum Aquifer, and the lower portion of the Dockum Aquifer. An accurate understanding of water levels in these aquifers requires knowledge of which water-level measurements are representative of which aquifer.

An accurate understanding of water levels in these aquifers requires knowledge of which water-level measurements are representative of which aquifer. Using available completion data for wells Final Conceptual Model Report for the High Plains Aquifer System Groundwater Availability Model 4.3-3 and the structural surfaces for the aquifers, the aquifer(s) across which the wells are completed was determined or estimated. The completion data consisted of screen top and bottom locations in 22 percent of the wells, total well depth only in 54 percent of the wells, and neither screen information nor total depth for 24 percent of the wells. For the wells with screen information, it was possible to identify the aquifer(s) across which the well is completed. The completion interval identified for the wells is considered to be certain. For the wells with total depth only, the completion interval was estimated, when possible, based on the predominate aquifer(s) present shallower than that total depth and the aquifer code provided in the source data. The completion interval identified for these wells is considered to be somewhat uncertain. For wells with neither screen information nor total depth, the completion interval was estimated in some cases using the aquifer code provided in the source data and the predominate aquifer(s) present at the location of the well. The completion interval identified for these wells is considered to be highly uncertain. For many wells, no completion interval could be identified. Using the estimated completion intervals, the wells were placed into \u201caquifer groups\u201d for the purpose of distilling the multiple combinations of aquifer completions into a manageable list. The aquifer group identifies the principle aquifer across which the well is completed and, if applicable, whether the completion includes additional aquifers overlying and/or underlying the principle aquifer. The aquifer groups and the number of wells identified in each group are summarized in Table 4.3.1. The spatial distribution of wells identified as completed into the Ogallala Aquifer or the Ogallala Aquifer and underlying aquifer(s) is provided in Figure 4.3.1. The location of wells identified as completed to the Rita Blanca or Edwards-Trinity (High Plains) aquifers, the Rita Blanca Aquifer and overlying and/or underlying aquifer(s), or the Edwards-Trinity (High Plains) Aquifer and overlying and/or underlying aquifer(s) are shown in Figure 4.3.2. The spatial distribution of wells identified as completed into the upper Dockum Group, both the upper and lower Dockum Group, or the upper Dockum Group and overlying aquifer(s) is shown in Figure 4.3.3. The spatial distribution of wells identified as completed into the lower Dockum Group, both the upper and lower Dockum Group, or the lower Dockum Group and overlying and/or underlying aquifer(s) is shown in Figure 4.3.4. Final Conceptual Model Report for the High Plains Aquifer System Groundwater Availability Model 4.3-4 The location of wells for which a completion interval could not be determined or estimated and wells not used in the analysis of water levels are shown in Figure 4.3.5. The majority of the wells with an undetermined completion are located in the portion of the active model area where multiple aquifers are present. The unused wells are those for which the water-level data and completion information for the well are not consistent. That is, these wells have maximum depths to water that are deeper than the indicated total depth of the well. Due to the potential uncertainty in the well data, the limited number of these wells, and the availability of water-level data from numerous other wells in the areas of these wells, the impact of not using these wells in the analysis of water levels was considered to be negligible. As shown in Figures 4.3.1 through 4.3.4, many wells were identified as being completed across more than one aquifer. For those wells, the measured water level represents a composite level and is not specific to any one aquifer. In order to provide the best estimate of water-level conditions within each aquifer in the High Plains Aquifer System, only water-level data for wells identified as completed into a single aquifer were used in the evaluation of water levels presented in the remainder of this section. A summary of the number of water-level measurements and wells by county for the Ogallala, Rita Blanca, Edwards-Trinity (High Plains), upper Dockum, and lower Dockum aquifers is provided in Table 4.3.2. The temporal distribution of water-level measurements for wells identified as completed solely within the Ogallala, Rita Blanca, Edwards-Trinity (High Plains), upper Dockum, and lower Dockum aquifers are shown in Figures 4.3.6 through 4.3.10, respectively. These figures show that few to no water-level measurements are available for the aquifers prior to 1930. A significant number of water-level measurements are available during the 1940s for the Ogallala, upper Dockum, and lower Dockum aquifers but very few are available during the 1940s for the Rita Blanca and Edwards-Trinity (High Plains) aquifers. By far, the greatest number of water- level measurements is available for the Ogallala Aquifer. These figures also show that the available number of water-level measurements varies from year to year. 4.3.2 Pre-development Water-Level Surfaces Pre-development conditions are defined as those existing in the aquifers before the natural flow of groundwater was disturbed by artificial discharge via pumping. Typically, pre-development conditions represent steady-state conditions in the aquifer; where aquifer recharge is balanced by Final Conceptual Model Report for the High Plains Aquifer System Groundwater Availability Model 4.3-5 natural aquifer discharge. The following discussion on pre-development conditions in the High Plains Aquifer System is presented by aquifer. 4.3.2.1 Ogallala Aquifer Pre-development Water-Level Surface Gould (1906, 1907) provides insight into the pre-development conditions in the Ogallala Aquifer in the eastern and western portions of the Texas panhandle, respectively.

Typically, pre-development conditions represent steady-state conditions in the aquifer; where aquifer recharge is balanced by Final Conceptual Model Report for the High Plains Aquifer System Groundwater Availability Model 4.3-5 natural aquifer discharge. The following discussion on pre-development conditions in the High Plains Aquifer System is presented by aquifer. 4.3.2.1 Ogallala Aquifer Pre-development Water-Level Surface Gould (1906, 1907) provides insight into the pre-development conditions in the Ogallala Aquifer in the eastern and western portions of the Texas panhandle, respectively. These areas correspond to the northern portion of the Ogallala Aquifer in Texas. Although wells were common in this portion of the state during his investigation, they were predominantly domestic and/or stock wells and are assumed to have had little impact on the pre-development water-level surface. In his section on water conditions by county, Gould (1906, 1907) indicates that the source for many of the creeks and streams in the counties of the panhandle were springs issuing from Tertiary-age sediments, which are equivalent to the Ogallala Aquifer. In addition, he observed a large number of springs along creek and stream banks. The majority of the spring issued from sands and gravels in the Tertiary sediments or from the contact between the Tertiary-age sediments and underlying red beds of the Triassic-age sediments, which are equivalent to the Dockum Aquifer. This information from Gould (1906, 1907) indicates that, prior to development, groundwater in the northern portion of the Ogallala Aquifer flowed locally towards streams that incised the aquifer. Several reports provide information on development of the Ogallala Aquifer for irrigation purposes. This information provides guidelines for evaluating the available water-level data with respect to which data are appropriate for use in estimating pre-development water levels. The following paragraphs provide a brief summary of the information provided in those reports. White and others (1940) report that the use of groundwater for irrigation purposes in the High Plains of Texas began in 1911 with the drilling of the first successful irrigation well west of the town of Plainview in Hale County. Six to seven additional irrigation wells were drilled that same year. Development of groundwater for irrigation purposes on a large scale began in 1912 with the establishment of the Texas Land and Development Company on a large track of land near the town of Plainview. Between 1912 and 1913, that company began operation of 85 irrigation wells. The location of the early Plainview irrigation district is shown on Figure 4.3.11. A survey of irrigation wells by Baker (1915) indicates that in 1914 there were 100 irrigation wells in the general vicinity of the town of Plainview (eastern Hale, western Floyd, and southern Final Conceptual Model Report for the High Plains Aquifer System Groundwater Availability Model 4.3-6 Swisher counties), 27 near the town of Hereford (southeastern Deaf Smith County), and 12 near the town of Muleshoe (northeastern Bailey and northwestern Lamb counties). These three areas were termed the Plainview, Hereford, and Muleshoe irrigation districts (see Figure 4.3.11). The number of irrigation wells in the Plainview district was reported at 160 in 1918 by the Texas Land and Development Company. Use of groundwater for irrigation purposes declined during World War I and, due to above-average rainfall, little irrigation was practiced from 1919 to 1926. Subsequent years of reduced rainfall resulted in increased development of the groundwater for irrigation purposes. By 1934, the number of irrigation wells in the Texas High Plains was 296 with 180 in the Plainview district, 46 in the Hereford district, and 27 in the Muleshoe district. A rapid increase in the number of irrigation wells occurred from 1934 to 1937, a slower increase occurred in 1938 and 1939, and the rate of increase in irrigation wells again increased in 1940. The majority of the irrigation wells were located in the Plainview, Hereford, or Muleshoe district prior to 1935. From 1935 to 1939, some of the new irrigation wells were drilled in these districts but many were drilled in new areas, including the Lubbock-Littlefield and Spring Lake irrigation districts (see Figure 4.3.11). Development of the Ogallala Aquifer in the northern High Plains began after that in the southern High Plains. Alexander (1961) reports that use of wells for irrigation began in the northern High Plains in the early 1930s with the drilling of about 16 wells. The majority of these early wells were located in Dallam County near the town of Texline (Texline irrigation district) (see Figure 4.3.11) and in Hansford County. Development of the aquifer for irrigation purposes accelerated in the 1950s due to the record drought that occurred during that decade. The number of irrigation wells in the northern High Plains was 150 in 1950 and increased to 1,206 in 1959. The greatest density of early irrigation wells was located in northwestern Dallam County near the town of Texline. Concentrated development also occurred in a large area in northern Moore, southern Sherman, and northwestern Hutchinson counties. A review of available transient water-level data from the early part of the 1900s also provided useful information for constructing the pre-development water levels for the Ogallala Aquifer. A review of these data indicated that water levels for wells located in the Texas portion of the Southern Ogallala Aquifer showed evidence of drawdown in the 1930s while water levels for some wells in the northern Ogallala Aquifer showed stable or slightly rising water levels during the 1930s to 1950s time period. Final Conceptual Model Report for the High Plains Aquifer System Groundwater Availability Model 4.3-7 Based on the information in Gould (1906, 1907) regarding the Ogallala Aquifer as the source of water for many streams and springs in the northern portion of the aquifer; the early history of irrigation development provided in White and others (1940), Baker (1915), and Alexander (1961); and a review of early transient water-level data, the pre-development water-level surface for the Ogallala Aquifer was initially developed using: \uf0b7 The ground surface elevation at the location of springs issuing from the Ogallala Aquifer (see Section 4.5 for a discussion"

The ground surface elevation was taken as the digital elevation model value at the spring location using ArcGIS. \uf0b7 The ground surface elevation at select locations along valleys where the Ogallala Aquifer is incised by streams. The ground surface elevation was taken as the digital elevation model value at locations where the base of the Ogallala Aquifer is exposed in valleys using ArcGIS. \uf0b7 Water-level measurements prior to 1930 in the Ogallala Aquifer. \uf0b7 Water-level measurements during the 1930s for wells located in the Northern Ogallala Aquifer having stable or slightly increasing water levels. These water levels were used because of a lack of pre-1930 data for this portion of the aquifer. The water-level control points used to construct the pre-development water-level surface for the Ogallala Aquifer are general coincident with those provided by United States Geological Survey (2013). Where not identical to the United States Geological Survey (2013) data, they are very similar in value. Using the above data, the initial pre-development water-level surface for the Ogallala Aquifer was above ground surface in many areas with local topographic lows. To force the pre- development water levels below ground surface, artificial control points were created. The water-level elevation for these control points was calculated as the ground surface elevation at those points (as determined in ArcGIS from the digital elevation model) minus an estimated depth to water. The estimated depth to water ranged from 10 to 50 feet and was based on observed depths to water for water-level measurements prior to 1930. In addition, the initial pre-development water-level surface for the Ogallala Aquifer was lower than water levels measured in the 1950s in central Lea County, New Mexico. Therefore, 1950s Final Conceptual Model Report for the High Plains Aquifer System Groundwater Availability Model 4.3-8 water-level measurements from this area of the aquifer were used in constructing the pre- development surface. The estimated pre-development water-level surface for the Ogallala Aquifer is shown in Figure 4.3.12. This figure also shows the control points used to create the surface and indicates the type for the control point. The type indicated as \u2018modified DEM\u2019 corresponds to the control points used to constrain the pre-development water levels below ground surface. The water-level control points in Texas will be used as calibration targets for the steady-state model. The water- level control points in New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Kansas will be used to guide calibration of the steady-state model but will not specifically be used as calibration targets. The calibration targets in the Ogallala Aquifer for the steady-state model are summarized in Table 4.3.3. Figure 4.3.12 shows pre-development groundwater flow predominately from the northwest to southeast with local diversions, which correspond to local topographic lows, in the Southern Ogallala Aquifer. Refer to Figure 2.1.3 for the location of topographic lows. Flow in the Northern Ogallala Aquifer is generally from west to east, again with local diversions to topographic lows. Flow between the southern and northern portions of the aquifer is to the northeast from about the northeastern corner of Randall County, Texas through Hemphill County, Texas. The pre-development water-level surface and resultant flow directions are consistent with those given in the United States Geological Survey Regional Aquifer-System Analysis reports for the Ogallala Aquifer (Gutentag and others, 1984; Luckey and others, 1986), the Southern Ogallala Aquifer groundwater availability model (Blandford and others, 2003, 2008), and the Northern Ogallala Aquifer groundwater availability model (Dutton and others, 2001a, Dutton 2004, INTERA, Inc. and Dutton, 2010). 4.3.2.2 Rita Blanca Aquifer Pre-development Water-Level Surface The earliest water levels available for wells completed into the Rita Blanca Aquifer were measured in the late 1930s, all in Cimarron County, Oklahoma. The earliest measurements in Texas and New Mexico were taken in the late 1940s and mid-1950s, respectively. Since few early water-level data are available for the Rita Blanca Aquifer, the pre-development surface was constructed using maximum water levels measured in wells regardless of time. In a few instances, the maximum water level for a well was not used in developing the pre-development Final Conceptual Model Report for the High Plains Aquifer System Groundwater Availability Model 4.3-9 surface because that value was inconsistent with maximum water-level values for nearby wells. The ground surface elevations at springs issuing from the Rita Blanca Aquifer (see Section 4.5) were also used in constructing the pre-development surface. The estimated pre-development water-level surface for the Rita Blanca Aquifer is shown in Figure 4.3.13. This figure also shows the control points used to create the surface and indicates the type for the control points. The water-level control points in Texas will be used as calibration targets for the steady-state model. The water-level control points in New Mexico and Oklahoma will be used to guide calibration of the steady-state model but will not specifically be used as calibration targets. The calibration targets in the Rita Blanca Aquifer for the steady-state model are summarized in Table 4.3.3. Figure 4.3.13 shows that groundwater flow in the aquifer is to the southeast. Generally, the estimated pre-development water levels in the Rita Blanca Aquifer are about 50 to 100 feet lower than the estimated pre-development water levels in the Ogallala Aquifer. 4.3.2.3 Edwards-Trinity (High Plains) Aquifer Pre-development Water-Level Surface The pre-development water-level surface for the Edwards-Trinity (High Plains) Aquifer was developed using the maximum water levels measured in wells regardless of time.

Generally, the estimated pre-development water levels in the Rita Blanca Aquifer are about 50 to 100 feet lower than the estimated pre-development water levels in the Ogallala Aquifer. 4.3.2.3 Edwards-Trinity (High Plains) Aquifer Pre-development Water-Level Surface The pre-development water-level surface for the Edwards-Trinity (High Plains) Aquifer was developed using the maximum water levels measured in wells regardless of time. The maximum water level for a well was not used in instances where that value was inconsistent with maximum water-level values for nearby wells. In addition, values for select wells were used in areas having numerous wells. The estimated pre-development water-level surface for the Edwards-Trinity (High Plains) Aquifer is shown in Figure 4.3.13. This figure also shows the control points used to create the surface. The control points in Texas will be used as calibration targets for the steady-state model. The water-level control points in New Mexico will be used to guide calibration of the steady-state model but will not specifically be used as calibration targets. The calibration targets in the Edwards-Trinity (High Plains) Aquifer for the steady-state model are summarized in Table 4.3.3. Figure 4.3.13 shows that groundwater flow in the aquifer is to the southeast. A comparison of this figure to the pre-development water levels in the Edwards-Trinity (High Plains) Aquifer groundwater availability model (Blandford and others, 2008) shows good consistency. Generally, the estimated pre-development water levels in the Edwards-Trinity (High Plains) Final Conceptual Model Report for the High Plains Aquifer System Groundwater Availability Model 4.3-10 Aquifer are about 50 to 100 feet lower than the estimated pre-development water levels in the Ogallala Aquifer. 4.3.2.4 Upper Dockum Group Pre-development Water-Level Surface The earliest water-level data for the upper Dockum Group consist of one value each in two wells measured in the late 1930s. Since these data are insufficient to create an estimate of pre- development conditions across the entire aquifer, additional control points were taken as the maximum water level measured in a well regardless of time. For the two wells with the early measurement, that measurement rather than the maximum water level measured in the well was used. The maximum water level for a well was not used in instances where that value was inconsistent with maximum water-level values for nearby wells. In addition, values for select wells were used in areas having numerous wells. The estimated pre-development water-level surface for the upper Dockum Group is shown in Figure 4.3.14. This figure also shows the control points used to create the surface and indicates the type for the control point. The control points in Texas will be used as calibration targets for the steady-state model. The water-level control points in New Mexico and Oklahoma will be used to guide calibration of the steady-state model but will not specifically be used as calibration targets. The calibration targets in the upper Dockum Group for the steady-state model are summarized in Table 4.3.3. Figure 4.3.14 shows that groundwater flow is to the southeast in the southern portion of the aquifer and predominately to the east in the northern portion of the aquifer, with some diversion around topographic lows. A comparison of this figure to the pre-development water levels for the upper Dockum Group in the Dockum Aquifer groundwater availability model (Ewing and others, 2008) shows that the pre-development water levels constructed for the current model are generally about 100 to 200 feet lower than those given in Ewing and others (2008). As discussed in Section 4.2, this current model includes a detailed investigation conducted to determine the structural surfaces for the aquifers of the High Plains Aquifer System. Those structures were then used to determined or estimate well completions. As a result, there is a difference in the wells identified as completed into the upper Dockum Group between the two studies. The identification of wells completed into the upper Dockum Group is considered to be more certain for this current study than for the study by Ewing and others (2008). This results in a significant Final Conceptual Model Report for the High Plains Aquifer System Groundwater Availability Model 4.3-11 difference in the estimated pre-development water-level surface for the upper Dockum Group between the two studies. Although the magnitude of the water levels is different for the two studies, both show that flow in the southern portion of the upper Dockum Group is predominately to the southeast. In the southern portion of the upper Dockum Group, pre-development water levels in the aquifer are about 25 to 100 feet lower than those in the overlying Ogallala Aquifer. In the northern portion of the upper Dockum Group, pre-development water levels in the aquifer are about 100 to 200 feet lower than those in the overlying Ogallala Aquifer. The estimated pre-development water levels in the southern portion of the upper Dockum Group are very similar to those in the Edwards-Trinity (High Plains) Aquifer. 4.3.2.5 Lower Dockum Group Pre-development Water-Level Surface Several water-level measurements are available for the lower Dockum Group prior to 1940, primarily located in the outcrop, southwest, and extreme northern portions of the aquifer. These measurements were assumed to be representative of pre-development conditions. The spatial distribution of these data is insufficient to create an estimate of pre-development water levels across the entire aquifer. Therefore, two additional types of control points were used to construct the pre-development water-level surface for the aquifer. The first was the ground surface elevation at the locations of springs issuing from the Dockum Aquifer. The ground surface elevation was taken as the digital elevation model value at the location of the springs as determined using ArcGIS. See Section 4.5 for a discussion of Dockum Aquifer springs. The second additional control consisted of the maximum water level measured in a well regardless of time. For the wells with water-level measurements prior to 1940, those measurements rather than the maximum water"

In addition, values for select wells were used in areas having numerous wells. In a few instances, the maximum water level reported for a well appeared anomalous relative to other measurements in the well. In those instances, the highest value most consistent with the other values was used rather than the maximum reported value. The estimated pre-development water-level surface for the lower Dockum Group is shown in Figure 4.3.15. This figure also shows the control points used to create the surface and indicates Final Conceptual Model Report for the High Plains Aquifer System Groundwater Availability Model 4.3-12 the type for the control point. The water-level control points in Texas will be used as calibration targets for the steady-state model. The water-level control points in New Mexico and Oklahoma will be used to guide calibration of the steady-state model but will not specifically be used as calibration targets. The calibration targets in the lower Dockum Group for the steady-state model are summarized in Table 4.3.3. Figure 4.3.15 shows that groundwater flow is generally to the southeast in the southern portion of the aquifer and to the east-southeast in the northern portion of the aquifer. Locally, groundwater is diverted from this general direction towards springs and the Canadian, Brazos, and Colorado rivers (refer to Figure 2.0.4 for the river locations) and in the vicinity of topographic lows (refer to Figure 2.1.3 for the location of topographic lows). A comparison of Figure 4.3.15 to the pre-development water levels for the lower Dockum Group in the Dockum Aquifer groundwater availability model (Ewing and others, 2008) was made. South of the Canadian River, that comparison shows that the surfaces are relatively similar in the southeast but differ by 100 to 200 feet to the northeast, with the current surface higher than that in Ewing and others (2008). For both studies, the overall direction of groundwater flow is similar. North of the Canadian River, the surface in Ewing and others (2008) indicates flow towards the southeast while the current surface indicates predominately eastward flow. The difference between the two surfaces is attributed to the difference in wells identified as completed into the lower Dockum Group between the two studies. In the southern portion of the lower Dockum Group, pre-development water levels in the aquifer are similar to those in the overlying Ogallala Aquifer over much of the area and are about 25 to 100 feet higher than those in the Ogallala Aquifer in places near the southern boundary of the Ogallala Aquifer. In the northern portion of the lower Dockum Group, pre-development water levels in the aquifer are about 100 to 200 feet lower than those in the overlying Ogallala Aquifer. The estimated pre-development water levels in the southern portion of the lower Dockum Group are, in general, about 100 to 200 feet higher than those in the Edwards-Trinity (High Plains) Aquifer. In general, the pre-development water levels in the lower Dockum Group are about 100 to 200 feet higher than those in the upper Dockum Group south of the Canadian River and about 25 to 200 feet lower than those in the upper Dockum Group north of the Canadian River. Final Conceptual Model Report for the High Plains Aquifer System Groundwater Availability Model 4.3-13 4.3.3 Transient Water-Level Data (Hydrographs) An evaluation of the transient behavior of water levels in the aquifers was conducted using transient water-level data in wells. In general, transient data were considered to consist of more than five water-level measurements. Due to the large volume of data for the Ogallala Aquifer, transient data were considered to consist of 10 or more water-level measurements over a period of five or more years. The location of wells with transient water-level data is shown in Figure 4.3.16 for wells completed into the Ogallala Aquifer, in Figure 4.3.17 for wells completed into the Rita Blanca and Edwards-Trinity (High Plains) aquifers, and in Figure 4.3.18 for wells completed into the upper and lower Dockum aquifers. Due to the large volume of transient data available for wells in the active model area, all hydrographs could not be presented and discussed in the report. The hydrographs discussed here were selected based on several criteria. First, a review of all hydrographs for an aquifer was conducted in order to select those with a long-term record. Second, hydrographs were selected based on spatial location in an effort to show transient conditions across as much of the aquifer as possible. Third, an effort was made to select hydrographs with sufficient data to define a water-level trend and with data that appear to be free of measurements potentially impacted by drilling and/or pumping activities. Since all hydrographs could not be presented, a brief summary of the trends observed in the available data is provided in Table 4.3.4 for wells located in Texas. This table is organized by aquifer and county. The county order is from north to south and east to west. The purpose of this table is to provide a general overview of the observed trends in water levels based on a review of all of the transient data. The remainder of this section first discusses overall trends observed in the transient water-level data and presents example hydrographs for select wells"

The remainder of this section first discusses overall trends observed in the transient water-level data and presents example hydrographs for select wells by aquifers. The scale for years on the x-axis is from 1900 to 2013 for all hydrographs. The scale for the water-level elevation on the y-axis is variable from hydrograph to hydrograph depending on the range of the observed data; however, the division of the y-axis is consistent at 25 feet. At the end of this section, select hydrographs for the aquifers showing seasonal trends are presented and discussed. Final Conceptual Model Report for the High Plains Aquifer System Groundwater Availability Model 4.3-14 4.3.3.1 Ogallala Aquifer Transient Water-Level Data This discussion provides a summary of the trends in water-level data observed in the Ogallala Aquifer and compiled in Table 4.3.4. Also included are example hydrographs for select wells identified as completed into the Ogallala Aquifer and located in the northern portion of the aquifer (Figure 4.3.19) and in the northern and southern counties in the southern portion of the aquifer (Figures 4.3.20 and 4.3.21, respectively). In some instances, a trend is discussed for a county but an example hydrograph for that county is not included in the figures. For these counties, refer to Table 4.3.4 for a description of the trends observed in the water-level data for wells located in that county. Counties in the Northern Portion of the Ogallala Aquifer Overall declining trends are observed in all or most wells in Dallam, Sherman, Hansford, Ochiltree, Hartley, Moore, Hutchinson, Roberts, Potter, and Carson counties, with the largest declines (up to 150 to 200 feet) occurring in Sherman, Hansford, Ochiltree, Hartley, Moore, and Carson counties. The hydrographs for wells 261703, 264901, and 356501 located in Hartley, Moore, and Ochiltree counties, respectively, shown on Figure 4.3.19 provide examples of these large declines. The smallest declines (50 to 75 feet) have been observed for wells in Roberts and Potter counties. The rate of decline in water level has been fairly stable in most wells, but decreased in around 1970 to 1980 for many wells. A few wells show a substantial increase in the rate of decline since the late 1990s. The hydrograph for well 264901 in Moore County provides an example of a fairly constant rate of decline and the hydrographs for well 247603 in Sherman County and well 356501 in Ochiltree County provide examples of the decline rate decreasing in about 1970 to 1980 and increasing again in the late 1990s (see Figure 4.3.19). Overall stable or slightly increasing or decreasing water-level trends are observed for the majority of the wells in Lipscomb, Hemphill, Gray, Wheeler, Armstrong, and Donley counties. In general, these rises and declines are on the order of less than 25 feet. The hydrographs for well 505901 in Hemphill County and well 529201 in Wheeler County show examples of stable water levels since the mid-1950s, and the hydrograph for well 1201617 in Donley County shows an example of rising water levels since about 1980 (see Figure 4.3.19). A few of the wells in Lipscomb County show a recent 50 to 75-foot decline in water level as shown by the hydrograph for well 439603 (see Figure 4.3.19). The water-level trend in several wells in Gray County show Final Conceptual Model Report for the High Plains Aquifer System Groundwater Availability Model 4.3-15 periods of recovery imposed on overall declining levels. One such example is shown for well 525904 (see Figure 4.3.19). Although many wells in Dallam and Carson counties show declining water-level trends, several wells in these counties show overall stable or slightly increasing trends. The hydrograph for well 239101 in Dallam County provides an example of a slightly rising overall trend (see Figure 4.3.19). Northern Counties in the Southern Portion of the Ogallala Aquifer In many of the northern counties of the southern portion of the Ogallala Aquifer, the overall long-term trend in water levels has not been consistent across the entire county. Good examples are observed in wells 1051703 and 2410201 in Bailey County and wells 2325904 and 2312803 in Lubbock County (see Figure 4.3.20). In Bailey County, well 1051703 shows an overall decline in water level of about 75 feet since 1950 and well 2410201 shows water levels that have fluctuated throughout the years but overall remained fairly stable. In Lubbock County, the water level in well 2325904 rose about 50 feet between about 1980 and 2000 and then remained constant while the water level in well 2312803 has continually declined by about 100 feet since the late 1950s (see Figure 4.3.20). In Parmer, Lamb, Hale, and Floyd counties, water levels throughout the county have predominately declined. The range in declines has been about 25 to 225 feet. A couple of wells in Hale County with long-term water-level data that includes early measurements show stable water levels from about 1915 to 1940 and declining water levels beginning in the early to late 1940s. An example of this trend is shown for well 1152703 (see Figure 4.3.20). Overall declining water levels in most wells and stable or rising water levels in a few wells are observed in Deaf Smith, Randall, Castro, Swisher, Briscoe, Bailey, and Crosby counties. Declines up to 200 feet have been observed in Swisher and Crosby counties and up to about 100 to 150 feet in in Deaf Smith, Castro, Briscoe, and Bailey counties. The rate of decline has been fairly constant for many of the wells with an overall declining trend. For example, well 1033802 in Parmer County and well 1152703 in Hale County (see"

In Bailey County, well 1051703 shows an overall decline in water level of about 75 feet since 1950 and well 2410201 shows water levels that have fluctuated throughout the years but overall remained fairly stable. In Lubbock County, the water level in well 2325904 rose about 50 feet between about 1980 and 2000 and then remained constant while the water level in well 2312803 has continually declined by about 100 feet since the late 1950s (see Figure 4.3.20). In Parmer, Lamb, Hale, and Floyd counties, water levels throughout the county have predominately declined. The range in declines has been about 25 to 225 feet. A couple of wells in Hale County with long-term water-level data that includes early measurements show stable water levels from about 1915 to 1940 and declining water levels beginning in the early to late 1940s. An example of this trend is shown for well 1152703 (see Figure 4.3.20). Overall declining water levels in most wells and stable or rising water levels in a few wells are observed in Deaf Smith, Randall, Castro, Swisher, Briscoe, Bailey, and Crosby counties. Declines up to 200 feet have been observed in Swisher and Crosby counties and up to about 100 to 150 feet in in Deaf Smith, Castro, Briscoe, and Bailey counties. The rate of decline has been fairly constant for many of the wells with an overall declining trend. For example, well 1033802 in Parmer County and well 1152703 in Hale County (see Figure 4.3.20). For many wells with an overall declining trend in water level, the rate of decline decreased, temporarily stopped or became very small, or water levels began to recover starting in about1970 to 1980. Wells 1032703 and 2304603 in Castro and Floyd counties, respectively, show examples of the decreasing rate of Final Conceptual Model Report for the High Plains Aquifer System Groundwater Availability Model 4.3-16 decline (see Figure 4.3.20). An example of the decline temporarily stopping and some recovery in the water level is provided in the hydrograph for wells 2419801 and 2421905 in Cochran and Hockley counties, respectively (see Figure 4.3.20). An example of the rate of decline becoming very small is provided in the hydrograph for well 1119401 in Swisher County, and the hydrograph for well 1007701 in Deaf Smith County shows an example of the decline stopping in about 1970 with some water-level recovery through current day (see Figure 4.3.20). In a few wells, the rate of water-level decline has increased since about 2005. For example, see the hydrograph for well 1044711 in Lamb County in Figure 4.3.20. Southern Counties in the Southern Portion of the Ogallala Aquifer Overall, declines in water levels have been less and occurred over a smaller area in the southern counties of the southern portion of the aquifer than in the counties in the northern portion of the Southern Ogallala Aquifer. Overall stable water levels are observed in Dickens and Midland counties. For example, see the hydrograph for well 2858601 in Midland County in Figure 4.3.21. Predominately rising trends in water level of less than 25 feet have been observed in Howard and Glasscock counties. Various trends in the water level are observed throughout Cochran, Hockley, Yoakum, and Ector counties. These trends include overall stable, rising, and declining water levels, as well as trends showing periods of both rising and declining water levels. The hydrograph for well 2439904 in Terry County shows an overall rising trend since the mid-1950s, and the hydrographs for well 2458101 in Yoakum County and well 4505916 in Ector County show periods of both rising and declining water levels (see Figure 4.3.21). The water level in several wells in Terry, Lynn, Gaines, Dawson, Andrews, Martin, Howard, and Midland counties show local highs centered on about 1990. Examples of these highs are provided in the hydrographs for wells 2707401 and 2342801 located in Gaines and Lynn counties, respectively (see Figure 4.3.21). Recent rises in water levels of about 25 to 50 feet are observed in a few wells each in Yoakum, Terry, Lynn, Gaines, Dawson, Martin, and Ector counties. One such example is provided by the hydrograph for well 2724202 in Dawson County (see Figure 4.3.21). 4.3.3.2 Rita Blanca Aquifer Transient Water-Level Data A summary of the trends in water-level data observed in the Rita Blanca Aquifer is provided in Table 4.3.4. Select hydrographs for wells identified as completed into the aquifer are shown in Figure 4.3.22. In Dallam County, Texas, the majority of the hydrographs show an overall Final Conceptual Model Report for the High Plains Aquifer System Groundwater Availability Model 4.3-17 decline in water level. Declines up to 150 feet have been observed in some wells. The rate of decline has generally been fairly constant in most wells. For example, see the hydrograph for well 249704 in Figure 4.3.22. In a few wells, a decrease in the rate of decline or a temporary stop in decline is observed for a period of time. The time period during which decline slowed or stopped varied between wells. Well 148902 shows a stop in decline between about 1985 and 2000, and the water level in well 242903 shows a slow rate of decline from about 1960 through 2010 and then a rapid rate of decline since that time (see Figure 4.3.22). In general, the water levels in wells in Cimarron County, Oklahoma have remained fairly constant or slightly declined over their period of record. Figure 4.3.22 includes the hydrograph for well 364241102591501, which shows an overall slightly declining trend, located in Cimarron County. In Union County, New Mexico, both relatively constant water levels and declining trends are observed in wells completed into the Rita Blanca Aquifer. The hydrograph for well 361847103064701 shows a fairly constant rate of decline over the period of record and the hydrograph for well 36131410318301 shows a fairly stable trend over the period of record (see Figure 4.3.22). Although the overall trend in water level in well 363041103054601 is declining, periods of both reduced decline and water-level recovery are observed in the water level for this well (see Figure 4.3.22). 4.3.3.3 Edwards-Trinity (High Plains) Aquifer Transient Water-Level Data A summary of the trends in water-level data observed in the Edwards-Trinity (High Plains) Aquifer is provided in Table 4.3.4. Select hydrographs for wells identified as completed into the aquifer are shown in Figure 4.3.22. Transient water-level data are available for only a few wells in Texas identified as completed into the Edwards-Trinity (High Plains) Aquifer. The trend in water level is variable for these wells. An overall declining trend is observed in well 2441402 in Yoakum County, and a relatively stable trend is observed in well 2309903 in Lubbock County. Periods of both rising and declining water level are observed in wells 2410303 and 2461401 in Bailey and Terry counties, respectively. In both of these wells, the water level rose from about 1970 to 1989, remained"

Select hydrographs for wells identified as completed into the aquifer are shown in Figure 4.3.23. Various trends in water level are observed in the aquifer. These trends include overall declining, overall rising, overall stable, and periods of both rising and declining water levels. Example declining water levels are provided by the hydrographs for well 755701 in Deaf Smith County and well 1134907 in Swisher County. Example rising water levels are shown for well 2759903 in Ector County and well 2335301 in Lubbock County. Example stable water levels are shown for wells 1010701 and 4501901 in Deaf Smith and Winkler counties, respectively. Transient records showing periods of both rising and declining water levels are provided by the hydrographs for wells 2849402 and 4521304 in Martin and Ector counties, respectively. 4.3.3.5 Lower Dockum Group Transient Water-Level Data A summary of the trends in water-level data observed in the lower Dockum Group is provided in Table 4.3.4. Select hydrographs for wells identified as completed into the aquifer are shown in Figure 4.3.24. In general, stable trends in the water level until between about 1995 and 2000 and then declining trends are observed for wells located in the northern portion of the aquifer. Example hydrographs showing these trends are given for well 717201 and 724403 in Hartley and Moore counties, respectively (see Figure 4.3.24). The overall trend in water level is either stable, rising, or declining for most wells located in the central portion of the aquifer. In general, the changes in water level are typically less than 50 feet. The hydrograph for well 743401 located in Oldham County shows an example of a slightly rising trend (see Figure 4.3.24). While not all counties are represented by hydrographs in Figure 4.3.24, the overall county trends and notable hydrographs are included in the county descriptions in Table 4.3.4. For example, a 125-foot decline from 1965 to 1990 is observed in one well located in Deaf Smith County. For wells located in Swisher County, periods of both rising and declining water levels are observed with the changes ranging from less than 25 feet to about 75 feet. Stable or slightly declining water levels (less than 10 feet) are observed in Crosby Final Conceptual Model Report for the High Plains Aquifer System Groundwater Availability Model 4.3-19 and Motley counties. An overall decline of about 75 feet from 1940 to 1970 is observed in one well located in Floyd County (Table 4.3.4). The hydrograph for well 661401 located in Armstrong County shows an initial steady decline followed by fairly stable water levels (see Figure 4.3.24). In the southern counties of the aquifer, the following observations are made based on review of the transient water-level data. Overall stable trends are observed for wells located in Crane, Sterling, and Upton counties (Table 4.3.4). An example hydrograph is given in Figure 4.3.24 for well 4554501 in Crane County. Overall slightly declining trends (less than 25 feet) are observed in Loving and Martin counties, moderate declines of 25 to 50 feet are observed in Reeves County, and some large declines (greater than 50 feet) are observed in Pecos County. Periods of both increasing and declining water levels are observed for wells in Glasscock County. Both stable and large declining trends are observed in wells in Ector, Ward, and Winkler counties (Table 4.3.4). An example declining trend in Ward County is given for well 4525713 in Figure 4.3.24. Periods of rising and declining water levels are also observed in several wells in Ward and Winkler counties (Table 4.3.4). One example is provided in Figure 4.3.24 for well 4616201 in Winkler County. The majority of the available transient water-level data for the lower Dockum Aquifer are for wells located in the outcrop area. Three types of trends are observed for these wells: overall rising water levels, overall declining water levels, and periods of rising and declining water levels. Generally, the rises and declines are less than 25 feet. However, periods of increases greater than 50 feet are observed in some wells (Table 4.3.4). Figure 4.3.24 shows several examples of hydrographs for wells located in the outcrop area of the aquifer. The hydrographs for wells 2925901 and 2943801 in Mitchell County and wells 2824904 and 2927702 in Scurry County show increasing water levels from about 1955 or 1965 to about 1990 and either stable or slightly declining water levels after that time. The hydrograph for well 2344608 in Garza County shows two cycles of rising and declining water levels with lows in about 1975 and 1998 and highs in about 1993 and 2008. 4.3.3.6 Seasonal Transient Water-Level Data The majority of the wells completed into the Ogallala Aquifer are used for irrigation purposes.

Therefore, they are typically pumped for only a portion of the year during crop growing season. Final Conceptual Model Report for the High Plains Aquifer System Groundwater Availability Model 4.3-20 Examples of seasonal changes in water levels are shown by the hydrographs for four wells in Figure 4.3.25. The hydrographs show, in general, declining water levels during the spring and summer and rising water levels from fall through winter of the next year. This trend is best observed in the hydrograph for well 712401 in Hartley County. For three of the hydrographs, this seasonal trend is imposed on an overall declining trend in water level. For well 2330103 in Crosby County, the seasonal trend is imposed on long-term declining and rising trends. Transient data at a sufficient frequency to show seasonal variations in water levels were found for one well each completed into the Rita Blanca, Edwards-Trinity (High Plains), and lower Dockum aquifers (Figure 4.3.26). The transient data for wells completed into the upper Dockum Group were not sufficient at any well to show seasonal variations. The seasonal data for well 249704 completed into the Rita Blanca Aquifer in Dallam County are for the early 1950s and show only about two seasonal cycles; one in 1952 and one in 1953. These data show highest water levels in the winter months, declining water levels in the spring to summer months, and rising water levels in the fall months. Seasonal data for well 2310401 completed into the Edwards-Trinity (High Plains) Aquifer in Hale County generally show rising water levels in the fall and winter months and declining water levels in the spring and summer months. Seasonal data for well 5206604 completed into the lower Dockum Group in Pecos County generally show rising water levels in the late summer to winter months and declining water levels in the spring and early summer months. These trends are consistent with seasonal pumping for crop irrigation. 4.3.4 Historical Water-Level Surfaces and Water-Level Declines Estimated historical water-level surfaces in the Ogallala, Rita Blanca, Edwards-Trinity (High Plains), lower Dockum, and upper Dockum aquifers were estimated for the years 1950, 1980, and 2010. In addition, the decline in water level from pre-development to 2010 was estimated. Only wells known to be completed into the aquifers were used to estimate their water-level surfaces. This was done so that the developed surfaces represent conditions within the aquifers themselves and are not influenced by composite water levels from wells completed into multiple aquifers. Water-level data are not available at regular time intervals in every well. Therefore, the coverage of water-level data for a particular month or even a year is sparse. Since the amount of Final Conceptual Model Report for the High Plains Aquifer System Groundwater Availability Model 4.3-21 water-level data available are typically not sufficient for a particular year of interest, the historical water-level surfaces were generally developed based on data from a few years before and after the year of interest. Generally, data from the year of interest and two years prior to and two years after the year of interest were used. On occasion, the range was expanded if there were insufficient data and narrowed if there were sufficient data. The ranges of years used to develop the historical surfaces are summarized in Table 4.3.5. For all aquifers, the average water level for a well was used if the well had several water-level measurements during the date range. 4.3.4.1 Water-Level Surfaces and Decline for the Ogallala Aquifer The estimated water-level surface for the Ogallala Aquifer in 1950 is shown in Figure 4.3.27. In order to constrain this surface below ground surface, several types of control points in addition to the 1950 water-level data were used to develop the surface. These control points were based on the assumptions that (1) springs issuing from the Ogallala Aquifer where still flowing in 1950 and (2) seepage from the aquifer where it is incised by the Canadian River was still occurring in 1950. Two pre-development water-level elevations in Lea County, New Mexico were used to ensure that the 1950 surface was below ground surface in that area of the aquifer. In addition, several of the modified digital elevation model control points developed for construction of the pre-development surface were also used to construct the 1950 surface. These points were used to insure that the 1950 surface was below ground surface in areas of topographic lows with no water-level control. The location and types of control points used to construct the 1950 water- level surface for the Ogallala Aquifer are also shown on Figure 4.3.27. The estimated water-level surfaces for the Ogallala Aquifer in 1980 and 2010 are shown in Figures 4.3.28 and 4.3.29, respectively. These surfaces were constructed using only water-level data for control. These surfaces do not show cones of depression centered on specific areas of high pumping. Rather, they show regional changes in water-level contours due to widespread pumping. This is best seen where the 3,400 and 3,600-foot contours shift to the west in Moore and Hartley counties in the Northern Ogallala Aquifer and shift to the northwest in Swisher and Castro counties in the Southern Ogallala Aquifer. The decline in water level in the Ogallala Aquifer from pre-development to 2010 was estimated using the changes in water levels observed in wells. The water-level change was calculated as the difference between the initial water level measured in a well and the last water level Final Conceptual Model Report for the High Plains Aquifer"

These surfaces were constructed using only water-level data for control. These surfaces do not show cones of depression centered on specific areas of high pumping.

The decline in water level in the Ogallala Aquifer from pre-development to 2010 was estimated using the changes in water levels observed in wells. The water-level change was calculated as the difference between the initial water level measured in a well and the last water level Final Conceptual Model Report for the High Plains Aquifer System Groundwater Availability Model 4.3-22 measured in a well. The most appropriate date for the first water-level measurement is prior to 1930 for that measurement to be representative of pre-development conditions. Ideally, the most appropriate last water level would be one measured after 2009. However, water-level measurements prior to 1930 and after 2009 were not available for any wells completed into the Ogallala Aquifer. However, a water-level measurement prior to 1930 and after 2005 was available for four wells. Since pre-1930 water-level data are available for few wells, the date for the first water-level measurement was increased to prior to 1960. For wells with a later date for the first water-level measurement, last measurements after 2009 were available. Based on the available data, four classes of control points were used to develop the pre-development to 2010 decline estimates. These are: \uf0b7 Initial measurement prior to 1930 and last measurement after 2005 (four wells) \uf0b7 Initial measurement during the 1930s and last measurement after 2009 (21 wells) \uf0b7 Initial measurement during the 1940s and last measurement after 2009 (58 wells) \uf0b7 Initial measurement during the 1950s and last measurement after 2009 (262 wells) The decline in water level in the Ogallala Aquifer estimated using these control points is shown in Figure 4.3.30. The control point type is also provided in this figure. Because some of the declines used to create this surface were calculated using later water-level measurements taken after development of the aquifer began, the actual decline in the aquifer is likely greater than shown on the figure. The largest water-level declines of over 200 feet are observed in the Southern Ogallala Aquifer in portions of Floyd and Hale counties and in small areas in Castro and Parmer counties. Declines of more than 150 feet have been experienced in large areas including portions of Parmer, Castro, Swisher, Lamb, Hale, Floyd, and Crosby counties in the Southern Ogallala Aquifer and in smaller areas including portions of Sherman, Moore, and Ochiltree counties in the Northern Ogallala Aquifer. The water-level declines shown in Figure 4.3.30 are very similar to the pre-development to 2011 declines given in McGuire (2012) for the High Plains Aquifer. 4.3.4.2 Water-Level Surfaces and Decline for the Rita Blanca Aquifer Water-level measurement data for the Rita Blanca Aquifer are insufficient to construct contours of the water-level surface in the aquifer in 1950. Therefore, the available data are posted in Final Conceptual Model Report for the High Plains Aquifer System Groundwater Availability Model 4.3-23 Figure 4.3.31. The estimated water-level surface for the Rita Blanca Aquifer in 1980 and 2010 are shown in Figures 4.3.32 and 4.3.33, respectively. The decline in water level from pre-development to 2010 in the Rita Blanca Aquifer is shown in Figure 4.3.34. These declines were constructed using the calculated water-level decline in wells with water-level measurements in both pre-development and 2010. The maximum decline of about 150 feet is observed in southwestern Dallam County. 4.3.4.3 Water-Level Surfaces and Decline for the Edwards-Trinity (High Plains) Aquifer Water-level measurement data for the Edwards-Trinity (High Plains) Aquifer are insufficient to construct contours of the water-level surface in the aquifer in 1950. Therefore, the available data are posted in Figure 4.3.31. The estimated water-level surface for the Edwards-Trinity (High Plains) Aquifer in 1980 is shown in Figure 4.3.32. Water-level measurement data for the Edwards-Trinity (High Plains) Aquifer are also insufficient to construct contours of the water- level surface in the aquifer in 2010. Therefore, the available data are posted in Figure 4.3.33. The decline in water level in the Edwards-Trinity (High Plains) Aquifer was estimated using the calculated water-level decline in wells with water-level measurements in both pre-development and 2010. These data are insufficient to construct contours, so the data are posted in Figure 4.3.34. The declines range from a high of more than 30 feet in Cochran and Yoakum counties to a low of 4 feet in Lubbock County. Note that the amount of the water-level decline varies significantly over short distances in some areas. 4.3.4.4 Water-Level Surfaces and Decline for the Upper Dockum Group The estimated water-level surfaces for the upper Dockum Group in 1950, 1980, and 2010 are shown in Figures 4.3.35 through 4.3.37, respectively. The 1950 surface is shown only in the southern portion of the aquifer because no data were available for the northern portion of the aquifer. For the 1980 surface, water-level elevations were not contoured for the northern portion of the upper Dockum Group because the spatial distribution of the data is insufficient to construct meaningful contours. The decline in water level from pre-development to 2010 in the upper Dockum Group is shown in Figure 4.3.38. The decline in water level in the aquifer was estimated using the calculated water-level decline in wells with water-level measurements in both pre-development and 2010. The decline surface is contoured only for the southern portion of the aquifer because the spatial Final Conceptual Model Report for the High Plains Aquifer System Groundwater Availability Model 4.3-24 distribution of the data in the northern portion of the aquifer is insufficient to construct meaningful contours. The largest declines are about 50 to 70 feet and occur in northeastern Deaf Smith County and south-central Swisher County. In general, declines of less than 10 feet are observed in the southern portion of the aquifer. The declines in the northern portion of the aquifer range from 1 to 24 feet and are greatest in"

Note that the amount of the water-level decline varies significantly over short distances in some areas. 4.3.4.4 Water-Level Surfaces and Decline for the Upper Dockum Group The estimated water-level surfaces for the upper Dockum Group in 1950, 1980, and 2010 are shown in Figures 4.3.35 through 4.3.37, respectively. The 1950 surface is shown only in the southern portion of the aquifer because no data were available for the northern portion of the aquifer. For the 1980 surface, water-level elevations were not contoured for the northern portion of the upper Dockum Group because the spatial distribution of the data is insufficient to construct meaningful contours. The decline in water level from pre-development to 2010 in the upper Dockum Group is shown in Figure 4.3.38. The decline in water level in the aquifer was estimated using the calculated water-level decline in wells with water-level measurements in both pre-development and 2010. The decline surface is contoured only for the southern portion of the aquifer because the spatial Final Conceptual Model Report for the High Plains Aquifer System Groundwater Availability Model 4.3-24 distribution of the data in the northern portion of the aquifer is insufficient to construct meaningful contours. The largest declines are about 50 to 70 feet and occur in northeastern Deaf Smith County and south-central Swisher County. In general, declines of less than 10 feet are observed in the southern portion of the aquifer. The declines in the northern portion of the aquifer range from 1 to 24 feet and are greatest in southwestern Dallam County (see Figure 4.3.38). 4.3.4.5 Water-Level Surfaces and Decline for the Lower Dockum Group The estimated water-level surfaces for the lower Dockum Group in 1950, 1980, and 2010 are shown in Figures 4.3.39 through 4.3.41, respectively. Construction of the 1950 surface assumed that springs issuing from the aquifer were still flowing in 1950. As such, the digital elevation model values for the ground surface elevation at spring locations were used as control points along with the available 1950 water-level data. The decline in water level from pre-development to 2010 in the lower Dockum Group is shown in Figure 4.3.42. The decline in water level in the aquifer was estimated using the calculated water-level decline in wells with water-level measurements in both pre-development and 2010. The maximum decline of about 95 feet is observed in northwestern Pecos County. The decline in this portion of the aquifer appears to be confined to a small area. A local region of decline on the order of about 35 feet is observed in southwestern Andrews County and north-central Winkler County. A larger region of decline is observed around an area of about a 60-foot decline located in New Mexico along the border between Curry and Roosevelt counties. A small local decline of about 45 feet is observed in southwestern Hartley County and of about 20 feet is observed along the boundary between Hartley and Moore counties. 4.3.5 Transient Water-Level Calibration Targets Water-level calibration targets for the transient model will include all water-level measurements for wells in Texas identified as completed into the Ogallala, Rita Blanca, Edwards-Trinity (High Plains), upper Dockum, or lower Dockum aquifers. Refer to Figures 4.3.1 through 4.3.4 for the location of wells completed to these aquifers. Although water levels measured in wells located in New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Kansas will be used to guide calibration of the transient model, those measurements will not specifically be used as calibration targets. Water-level data for wells where the completion interval could not be determined will not initially be used as calibration targets. This is because the aquifer associated with water levels in these wells is Final Conceptual Model Report for the High Plains Aquifer System Groundwater Availability Model 4.3-25 uncertain. However, if a well with an undetermined completion and transient water-level data is located in an area of the model with few calibration targets, an investigation may be conducted to estimate the most likely completion interval for the well. This investigation would compare the total depth of the well and the measured water levels to the total depths and water levels in nearby wells with known completion intervals to see if they are similar. If so, the assumption may be made that the completion interval for the well is the same as that of the nearby well with approximately the same total depth and water levels. The number of calibration targets for the transient model by aquifer, county, and decade is shown in Table 4.3.6. 4.3.6 Cross Formational Flow Several studies of the hydrogeology and/or hydrochemistry between the aquifers in the High Plains Aquifer System have been published. This section provides a brief summary of the results related to cross-formational flow in those studies. Nativ and Gutierrez (1988) evaluated the lithology between the Edwards-Trinity (High Plains) Aquifer and the overlying Ogallala Aquifer and underlying Dockum Group. They also compared potentiometric surfaces in the 1978 through 1987 time frame and hydrochemistry between the aquifers to assess locations with potential cross-formational flow. This evaluation identified locations where the water level in Edwards-Trinity (High Plains) Aquifer was higher than that in the Ogallala Aquifer and a permeable or semi-permeable contact exists between the two aquifers, indicating the potential for upward flow, in central Bailey, northwest Lubbock, northeast Gaines, and Dawson counties, Texas and central Lea and southwestern Roosevelt counties, New Mexico. A comparison of water chemistry in the two aquifers in these areas is consistent with cross-formational flow from the Edwards-Trinity (High Plains) Aquifer to the Ogallala Aquifer. Citing Nativ and Smith (1985), they indicate the probability of cross-formational flow from the Edwards-Trinity (High Plains) Aquifer to the overlying Ogallala Aquifer where the Ogallala Aquifer is thin and where it has a small saturated thickness based on groundwater chemistry and isotopic data. They do not, however, identify the areas where this likely occurs. Nativ and Gutierrez (1988) found that the water level in the Edwards-Trinity (High Plains) Aquifer was higher than that in the Dockum Group throughout most of the extent of the Edwards-Trinity (High Plains) Aquifer. In areas of Cochran, Hockley, Yoakum, Terry, Lynn, and Gaines counties, a permeable contact also exists between the two aquifers, indicating potential areas for downward flow from the Edwards-Trinity (High Plains) Aquifer to the Final Conceptual Model Report for the High Plains Aquifer System Groundwater Availability Model 4.3-26 Dockum Group. They could not, however, confirm this downward flow with chemical data due to a lack of available wells in the Dockum Group. In addition, they suggest likely upward flow from the Dockum Group to the Edwards-Trinity (High Plains) Aquifer in Lea and Roosevelt counties, New Mexico based on lithology and water level and water chemistry data. Additional information related to the potential for cross-formational flow between the Ogallala, Edwards-Trinity (High Plains), and Dockum aquifers is available in Nativ (1988).

Additional information related to the potential for cross-formational flow between the Ogallala, Edwards-Trinity (High Plains), and Dockum aquifers is available in Nativ (1988). Her analysis considered water-level surface maps for the Ogallala Aquifer in 1978. The dates for the water- level maps she used for the Edwards-Trinity (High Plains) and Dockum aquifers are not provided. The chemical and isotopic composition of the groundwater in the aquifers was compared and the lithology of the sediments at aquifer contacts was investigated. Based on her study, Nativ (1988) states that the data suggests that flow occurs from the Edwards-Trinity (High Plains) Aquifer to the Ogallala Aquifer in the Midland Region (in parts of Bailey, Lamb, Hale, Cochran, Hockley, Lubbock, Yoakum, Terry, Lynn, Gains, Dawson, Ector, Martin, and Glasscock counties, Texas and Lea County, New Mexico). In areas where the water level in the Ogallala Aquifer is higher than that in the Dockum Group and lithologic evidence indicates the potential for hydraulic connection between the two aquifers, the chemical and isotopic composition of the aquifers is not similar, indicating a lack of downward flow from the Ogallala Aquifer to the Dockum Group. Along the Eastern Caprock Escarpment and a few areas to the west, the water level in the Dockum Group is higher than that in the Ogallala Aquifer. In these areas, which include Crosby, northwestern Deaf Smith, Dickens, Garza, Howard, and Parmer counties, Texas and Curry County, New Mexico, chemical and isotopic data support upward flow from the Dockum Group to the Ogallala Aquifer. Upward flow from the Dockum Group into the Ogallala Aquifer is also suggested by chemical and isotopic data in areas where the water level is higher in the Dockum Group than in the Ogallala Aquifer and the saturated thickness of the Ogallala Aquifer is small. Such an area occurs in southeastern Deaf Smith County near Tierra Blanca Creek. Nativ (1988) indicates the possibility of some localized flow from the Permian-age formations upward to the Ogallala Formation along the Eastern Caprock Escarpment based on chemical and isotopic data. One such occurrence is indicated in Donley County. Information regarding the potential for cross-formational flow is also available in Scanlon and others (2005b) based on measured arsenic concentrations in the Ogallala, Edwards-Trinity (High Final Conceptual Model Report for the High Plains Aquifer System Groundwater Availability Model 4.3-27 Plains), and Edwards-Trinity (Plateau) aquifers. In general, arsenic concentrations in the Ogallala Aquifer are high in the south and decline to the north. The northern portion of the Edwards-Trinity (High Plains) Aquifer underlying the area of the Ogallala Aquifer with lower arsenic concentrations also has low arsenic concentrations. However, the southern portion of the Edwards-Trinity (High Plains) Aquifer underlying the area of the Ogallala Aquifer with higher arsenic concentrations also has elevated arsenic concentrations. These results suggest the likelihood that arsenic is not naturally occurring in the Edwards-Trinity (High Plains) Aquifer but, rather, is a result of cross-formational flow from the Ogallala Aquifer to the Edwards-Trinity (High Plains) Aquifer. In addition, arsenic concentrations in the Edwards-Trinity (Plateau) Aquifer are elevated only where it overlies the very southern portion of the Ogallala Aquifer, which has elevated arsenic concentrations. In the remainder of the Edwards-Trinity (Plateau) Aquifer, arsenic concentrations are very low, indicating that it is unlikely that arsenic is originating from the formations comprising the Edwards-Trinity (Plateau) Aquifer. Rather, the trend in arsenic concentrations suggest the likelihood of downward flow from the Ogallala Aquifer to the Edwards-Trinity (Plateau) Aquifer.

In many of these wells, the rate of decline decreases in about 1980. In a few wells, water levels temporarily recovered from about 1965 to 1980 or from 1980 to 1990. Several of the wells show an overall rising trend. Parmer 111 Almost all hydrographs show an overall declining trend. Declines range from 25 to about 200 feet. Typical declines are greater than 100 feet. The rate of decline decreased in many wells in 1975 to 1980. The water level began to recovery in many of those wells, but not to pre-decline levels. The rate of decline was constant for many of the wells. Castro 102 Most hydrographs show an overall decline in water level but a few show an overall rise in water level. The declines range from less than 25 feet to 150 feet. The typical decline is 75 to 100 feet. The rate of decline was constant in many wells but decreased in about 1980 for many wells.

Final Conceptual Model Report for the High Plains Aquifer System Groundwater Availability Model 4.4-1 4.4 Recharge This section discusses the conceptual approach for estimating average recharge and for distributing recharge spatially and temporally in the High Plains Aquifer System. 4.4.1 Introduction Recharge can be defined as water that enters the saturated zone at the water table (Freeze, 1969). Recharge is a complex function of the rate and volume of precipitation, soil type, water level, soil moisture, topography, and evapotranspiration (Freeze, 1969). In the High Plains Aquifer System, potential sources for recharge include precipitation, irrigation subsurface return flow, and leakage from playa lakes, streams and reservoirs. Precipitation and irrigation return flow are generally considered to be diffuse sources of recharge, while stream or reservoir leakage are considered to be focused sources of recharge. Playa lakes, a distinct feature of the High Plains, are technically point sources of recharge. However, the playa density in many areas is sufficiently high to result in what is effectively an areally-distributed source of recharge (Mullican and others, 1997). In the model area, recharge primarily occurs in the Ogallala Aquifer and Dockum Aquifer outcrops. Although not explicitly included in this analysis, the Rita Blanca Aquifer outcrop is assumed to have similar recharge behavior to the Ogallala Aquifer outcrop. The Edwards Trinity (High Plains) Aquifer has minimal outcrop exposure and so is not included in this analysis. Within the model area, there are some alluvial areas, including one near the southeastern section of the Dockum Aquifer near the Colorado River, that may have some infiltration. The Ogallala Aquifer outcrop consists of a distinct northern and southern region, divided approximately at the Canadian River incision in the west (Figure 4.4.1). Since these two regions have different recharge characteristics, they are treated separately in this recharge analysis. For clarification, in this report, the area described as the \"Southern Ogallala Aquifer\" is consistent with the region described as the \"Southern High Plains Aquifer\" in United States Geological Survey reports (for example, Fahlquist, 2003) and the \"Southern Ogallala Aquifer\" in TWDB reports (Blandford and others, 2003; Blandford and others, 2008). The area described as the \"Northern Ogallala Aquifer\" in this report corresponds to the portion of the region described as the \"Central High Plains Aquifer\" in United States Geological Survey reports (for example, Bruce and others, 2003) that falls below the Cimarron River. It is also consistent with the extent Final Conceptual Model Report for the High Plains Aquifer System Groundwater Availability Model 4.4-2 of the \"Northern Ogallala Aquifer\" as described in TWDB reports (Dutton and others, 2001a). The Southern Ogallala Aquifer comprises a larger portion (approximately 29,600 square miles) of the current model area than the Northern Ogallala Aquifer (approximately 25,500 square miles). The Dockum Aquifer outcrop is separated into three regions, although this is due to geography, not necessarily due to recharge differences. The largest section of the Dockum Aquifer outcrop (3,447 square miles) is located southeast of the Southern Ogallala Aquifer, near the headwaters of the Colorado River (Figure 4.4.1). Another outcrop area (1,338 square miles) falls between the Southern and Northern Ogallala aquifers along the Canadian River, and the smallest outcrop area (213 square miles) comprises a thin strip along the eastern escarpment of the Southern Ogallala Aquifer. 4.4.2 Previous Regional Recharge Studies Many previous studies have estimated groundwater recharge in the Texas High Plains based on regional groundwater flow modeling and groundwater tracer data (Table 4.4.1).

One of the earliest groundwater models of the Texas High Plains used recharge estimates of 0.06 \u2013 0.83 inches per year based on unsaturated zone water content data in irrigated and nonirrigated areas of each county (Klemt, 1981; Knowles and others, 1984). Regional groundwater flow modeling by Luckey and others (1986) in the Southern Ogallala Aquifer used a mean pre-development recharge rate of 0.13 and 0.14 inches per year in the Northern Ogallala Aquifer. They assumed recharge under rainfed and irrigated land in the Southern Ogallala Aquifer increased by 2 inches per year during the development period of 1960 to 1980, which provided the equivalent of 0.6 inches per year additional recharge spread over the whole Southern Ogallala Aquifer area. Automated inverse modeling in the regional flow model by Stovall (2001) produced a mean recharge rate of 2.75 inches per year in the Southern Ogallala Aquifer. Luckey and Becker (1999) simulated regional groundwater flow in the Northern Ogallala Aquifer. Pre-development recharge was determined according to soil type, ranging from 0.4 percent of precipitation in most of the region to 4 percent of precipitation in very sandy areas. Post-development recharge rates were adapted to account for the effects of cultivation. Recharge was assumed to be 3.9 percent of precipitation in areas under dryland cultivation due to the increased infiltration during land fallowing. In irrigated agricultural areas, they assumed that Final Conceptual Model Report for the High Plains Aquifer System Groundwater Availability Model 4.4-3 irrigation return flow was 24 percent of pumpage during the 1940s and 1950s and decreased to 2 percent by the 1990\u2019s due to increases in irrigation efficiency. Dutton and others (2001a) varied recharge rates with precipitation and soil texture in the regional groundwater flow model of the Northern Ogallala Aquifer, with recharge rates varying from less than 1 to 6 percent of precipitation. These recharge rates were weighted according to soil texture by a factor of 1.2 in loamy surface and subsurface soils, a factor of 0.4 in loamy surface soils underlain by clayey subsurface soils, and a factor of 2.0 in windblown sands. As in Luckey and Becker (1999), Dutton and others (2001a) conceptualized that percolation from irrigation return flow was decreased from 24 percent of irrigation in the 1950s to 2 percent after the 1990s, reflecting increasing efficiency of irrigation technologies. However, they eventually concluded that the percolation from irrigation return flow has not reached the water table and, therefore recharge was not affected. Blandford and others (2003) applied recharge rates of 0.007 to 0.085 inches per year for the pre- development period in the Southern Ogallala Aquifer. Higher recharge rates were applied in the northern region of the model, in areas of low permeability soils but high playa density. Recharge representative of the development period averaged 0.65 inches per year in the Southern Ogallala Aquifer overall but 1 inches per year in the northern portion. Wood and Sanford (1995a) and Scanlon and others (2010b) used the chloride mass balance approach to estimate regional recharge rates in the central and northern sections of the Southern Ogallala Aquifer. Wood and Sanford (1995a) estimated that regional recharge in the northern part of the Southern Ogallala Aquifer was 0.43 inches per year. Scanlon and others (2010b) estimated regional recharge rates ranging from 0.16 to 0.91 inches per year in the western half of the Northern Ogallala Aquifer where groundwater is not affected by upward flow of deep brines. High recharge rates (0.55 to 1.61 inches per year) along the eastern escarpment are attributed to very sandy soils (clay content 5 to 12 percent). Scanlon and others (2010b) also estimated recharge rates using groundwater level hydrographs in the sandy zones in the southeastern section of the Northern Ogallala Aquifer where total groundwater level rise was 3.3 to 18.7 feet over time periods of 9 to 53 years (median 30 years). This resulted in an estimated recharge rate of 0.17 to 2.68 inches per year (median 0.55 inches per year) for this region. Final Conceptual Model Report for the High Plains Aquifer System Groundwater Availability Model 4.4-4 4.4.3 Factors Affecting Recharge 4.4.3.1 Precipitation All natural (that is., not irrigation return flow) recharge originates as precipitation. Even when other factors, such as soil texture, are used to determine recharge distribution, the amount of recharge is still often described as a percentage of total precipitation. Therefore, regardless of other controlling factors, recharge is expected to scale with precipitation. As shown in Figure 2.1.6, mean annual precipitation in the model area increases from southwest to northeast. Mean annual precipitation is slightly higher in the Northern Ogallala Aquifer outcrop (20.3 inches) relative to the Southern Ogallala Aquifer outcrop (18.3 inches). The southeastern Dockum Aquifer outcrops along the Colorado River and the eastern escarpment also have slightly higher mean annual precipitation (21.1 and 22.1 inches, respectively) compared to the northwestern outcrop along the Canadian River (18.4 inches). Therefore, potential recharge is slightly higher in the Northern Ogallala Aquifer outcrop and the eastern Dockum Aquifer outcrops. 4.4.3.2 Soils Soil properties can have a significant influence on recharge because of their impact on runoff, infiltration, and even evapotranspiration. In general, sandy soils will typically accept more infiltration for a given precipitation event than will clayey soils. Clay soils will tend to retain water, allowing more time for evapotranspiration by vegetation. Soils were evaluated based on data from the STATSGO database (United States Department of Agriculture, 1994), which includes data on soils to a depth up to about 6 to 7 feet below the surface.

In general, sandy soils will typically accept more infiltration for a given precipitation event than will clayey soils. Clay soils will tend to retain water, allowing more time for evapotranspiration by vegetation. Soils were evaluated based on data from the STATSGO database (United States Department of Agriculture, 1994), which includes data on soils to a depth up to about 6 to 7 feet below the surface. Soils in the model area are highly variable, ranging from clay loam to sand with clay content values ranging from near zero to 68 percent. Soils in the region can be categorized broadly into four categories based solely on soil texture including (1) clay loams, with clay contents greater than 35 percent, (2) loams, with clay contents ranging from 25 to 35 percent, (3) sandy loams, with clay contents ranging from 14 to 25 percent and (4) sands, with clay contents less than 14 percent (Figure 4.4.2). Clay loams generally correspond to lower recharge rates, since the high clay content (greater than 35 percent) means they can swell and restrict the flow of water from the surface to the water table. Clay loams are located primarily in the central regions of the Northern Ogallala Aquifer and the northern part of the Southern Ogallala Aquifer. They appear as Sherm series soils north Final Conceptual Model Report for the High Plains Aquifer System Groundwater Availability Model 4.4-5 of the Canadian River and as Pullman series soils south of the Canadian River. Clay loam occupies approximately 20 percent of both the Northern and Southern Ogallala Aquifer regions. Clay loam is also present in the Dockum Aquifer Colorado River outcrop area as Vernon, Stamford, Sagerton, and Rowena series soils, representing approximately50 percent of that outcrop area (Figure 4.4.2) Loams are less restrictive for recharge than clay loams, but the greatest recharge is expected under sandy soils. As well as having a higher clay content, loams are generally finer-grained, allowing for water retention, whereas sands are coarser-grained, leading to less water retention and more direct flow from the surface to the water table. Loams make up 51 percent of the Northern Ogallala Aquifer area, primarily falling west of the Sherm clay loam. Sands are more prevalent along the Canadian River and the eastern margin, representing approximately15 percent of the Northern Ogallala Aquifer area. South of the restrictive Pullman clay loam, soils in the Southern Ogallala Aquifer transition from finer grained loamy soils (25 to 28 percent clay) in the northern and eastern regions to sandier loamy soils (11 to 24 percent clay) in the south and west. Loams make up 75 percent of the Southern Ogallala Aquifer and consist mostly of Amarillo, Patricia, Olton, and Portales series soils. Sandy soils represent only ~3 percent of the Southern Ogallala Aquifer area and consist mostly of Wickett, Triomas, Penwell, Stegal, and Jalmar series soils. The Dockum Aquifer outcrop area in the Colorado River region has small regions of loam consisting of Miles, Cobb, and Mansker series soils (24 to 25 percent clay) and only isolated areas of sandy soils consisting mainly of Springer and Tivoli series soils (11 to 16 percent clay). The Dockum Aquifer outcrop area in the Canadian River region is dominated by loam consisting of Quay, Montoya, and Glenrio series soils (average approximately 33 percent clay). Some sandy soil occurs adjacent to the Canadian River, consisting of Yahola and Lincoln series soils (average 12 percent clay). 4.4.3.3 Topography Topography affects the distribution of recharge, concentrating recharge in highlands and discharge in lowlands (Meyboom, 1966; Toth, 1963). Modeling studies in Freeze (1971) concluded that when the saturated zone is under higher gradients, for instance in a topographically elevated area, the unsaturated zone delivers greater flow rate, thus, increasing Final Conceptual Model Report for the High Plains Aquifer System Groundwater Availability Model 4.4-6 recharge. However, while the effects of topography are important in our study area, they cannot be separated from the effects of soil texture described in the previous section. A previous study of the Northern Ogallala Aquifer in Texas showed that recharge was regionally related to not just topography or soil texture individually but a combination of the two properties (Scanlon and others, 2010b). As long as an area has a low slope (less than 5 percent), soil texture has the greatest effect on recharge. However, regions that have a slope greater than 5 percent exhibit similar recharge behavior regardless of soil texture. Therefore, in addition to the four soil categories listed earlier, a fifth category is necessary to differentiate high slope areas of any soil texture. For this analysis, mean slopes were derived from a 30-meter digital elevation model (United States Geological Survey, 2012) of the region (Figure 4.4.3). These data were used to calculate the average slope value for each STATSGO soil map unit. If the average slope is greater than 5 percent, that soil map unit is designated as \u201chigh slope\u201d in Figure 4.4.2. Topography in the Ogallala Aquifer region is variable but mostly flat (slope less than 5 percent) in the Southern Ogallala Aquifer and in much of the Northern Ogallala Aquifer (Figure 4.4.3). This results in a largely internal drainage system for the region, in which runoff generally concentrates in playa lakes. The effects of these playa lakes on recharge are discussed in Section 4.4.3.5. Steeper topography is limited to the margins of the eastern escarpment and along a few incised river valleys located in the northern part of the study area, including the Canadian River, the drainage network of small tributaries to the Beaver River, and Wolf Creek. Thus, areas with higher median slope (greater than 5 percent) are primarily located in the Northern Ogallala Aquifer region in areas with marginal to clay loam and in areas near the Canadian River. These sections have a mean slope of 6.5 percent and represent"

Thus, areas with higher median slope (greater than 5 percent) are primarily located in the Northern Ogallala Aquifer region in areas with marginal to clay loam and in areas near the Canadian River. These sections have a mean slope of 6.5 percent and represent approximately 14 percent of the Northern Ogallala Aquifer area. The average clay content is approximately 22 percent and generally consists of soils with a sandy loam soil texture. Topography in the Dockum Aquifer outcrop areas is generally steeper and more variable than in the Ogallala Aquifer areas, ranging from an average slope of 3.1 percent in the Colorado River area to 4.4 percent in the Canadian River area to 18 percent in the narrow eastern escarpment area. Areas with steeper slopes tend to have enhanced runoff and are, thus, less likely to be areas where significant recharge occurs. In these regions, recharge is generally restricted to areas Final Conceptual Model Report for the High Plains Aquifer System Groundwater Availability Model 4.4-7 where runoff is focused, such as in stream beds, or areas with very coarse textured soils, such as sand dunes. 4.4.3.4 Land Use/Vegetation Type When infiltrating water evaporates from the shallow subsurface or is transpired by plants, it is no longer available to reach the water table and become recharge. Therefore, land use and vegetation type, which generally control the amount of evapotranspiration occurring, can have a significant impact on recharge. For instance, if rangeland is developed and given an impervious surface, infiltration and, thus, recharge are severely reduced. If a field of deep-rooted grass is replaced with shallow-rooted crops, it becomes easier for precipitation to infiltrate below the shallower rooting zone, resulting in greater recharge. The natural vegetation prior to agricultural development primarily consisted of short-grass prairie grazed by bison (Fahlquist, 2003). Agricultural development began in the late 1800s and early 1900s. In counties where the majority of land falls within either the Ogallala Aquifer or Dockum Aquifer outcrops, farm acreage peaked in the 1950s (United States Department of Agriculture, 1935, 1954, 1974, 2007). However, after a small decline, the amount of agricultural land has remained relatively stable to the present day (Figure 4.4.4). Current land use in the Ogallala Aquifer region of the model area is dominated by rangeland (62 percent of the area) and cropland (32 percent of area) (Fry and others, 2011) (Figure 4.4.5, Table 4.4.2). The outcrop areas of the Dockum Aquifer consist mostly of rangeland (90 percent) and crops (7 percent) in the Colorado River region and almost exclusively rangeland (99 percent) in the Canadian River and eastern escarpment outcrop areas. 4.4.3.4.1 Rangeland Rangeland, which includes grassland and shrubland, covers 62 percent of the Ogallala Aquifer in the model area. Scanlon and others (2010a,b) estimated recharge rates in the Ogallala Aquifer based on nitrate and chloride profiles in boreholes drilled into the unsaturated zone (Figure 4.4.5). In the Northern Ogallala Aquifer, the average recharge rate in rangeland vegetation was negligible (0.058 inches per year). In the Southern Ogallala Aquifer, none of the boreholes showed evidence of any recharge. The general lack of recharge in rangeland areas is attributed to perennial growth and deep roots of primarily native grasses and shrubs that opportunistically remove all infiltrated water. Final Conceptual Model Report for the High Plains Aquifer System Groundwater Availability Model 4.4-8 However, this process apparently does not completely intercept all infiltrating water in areas of extremely coarse grained soils in the Northern Ogallala Aquifer (Scanlon and others, 2010b). In the Dockum Aquifer outcrop areas, rangeland vegetation dominates all three regions, comprising 99 percent of both the Canadian River and eastern escarpment regions and 90 percent of the Colorado River region. Shrubland is the dominant land cover in all three regions (53 to 62 percent), followed by grassland (16 to 40 percent). Forest comprises 21 percent of the eastern escarpment region and crops cover 7 percent of the Colorado River outcrop region. 4.4.3.4.2 Cropland Total cultivated agriculture covers 17,835 square miles (32 percent) of the land area in the entire Ogallala Aquifer (Fry, and others, 2011). Of that, the Southern Ogallala Aquifer has approximately twice as much cultivated area (11,823 square miles) relative to the Northern Ogallala Aquifer (6,011 square miles) because soil types and surface slopes more conducive to farming are more widespread in the south. Dominant crops include wheat (63 percent of cropland), corn (27 percent), and sorghum (10 percent), according to the Agricultural Census for 2007 from the National Agricultural Statistics Service (United States Department of Agriculture, 2007). Land under rainfed agriculture has very different recharge characteristics from land under irrigated agriculture. However, since the Fry and others (2011) land use/land cover map shown in Figure 4.4.5 does not distinguish between irrigated and rainfed agriculture, these distinctions had to be determined by other methods. Two studies produced estimates of the percentage of irrigated land surface in the model area based on analysis of satellite imagery. Ozdogan and Gutman (2008) estimated that irrigated land made up 8 percent of the total Ogallala Aquifer model area in 2001, while Qi and others (2002) estimated it made up 12 percent in 1992. Assuming the rest of the cultivated area is under rainfed agriculture, approximately 62 to 75 percent (approximately two thirds) of the total cultivated area in the Ogallala Aquifer is rainfed agriculture. These estimates agree well with recent Census of Agriculture data (United States Department of Agriculture, 1997, 2007) which place irrigated acreage at about 8 percent of the total area of counties in the Northern Ogallala Aquifer and 14 percent in the Southern Ogallala Aquifer. The irrigated acreage in the Southern Ogallala Aquifer has remained relatively constant since the 1950s, except for a"

The irrigated acreage in the Southern Ogallala Aquifer has remained relatively constant since the 1950s, except for a peak in the 1970s when irrigated acreage was 20 percent of Final Conceptual Model Report for the High Plains Aquifer System Groundwater Availability Model 4.4-9 total area. The irrigated acreage in the Northern Ogallala Aquifer has been constant since the 1970s. Prior to that, however, the reported irrigated acreage was much lower: less than 1 percent of total area in the 1950s. The irrigated acreage in the Dockum Aquifer has been consistently low since the 1950s, hovering at approximately 1 percent of the total area of the counties in both the Canadian and Colorado River outcrops (United States Department of Agriculture, 1954, 1974, 1997, 2007). 4.4.3.4.2.1 Rainfed Agriculture Rainfed agriculture is more widespread in the Southern Ogallala Aquifer, constituting 67 to 77 percent of the total cultivated area. In the Northern Ogallala Aquifer, it constitutes 58 percent to 75 percent of the total cultivated area. Recharge from land under rainfed cultivation depends heavily on the amount of precipitation and the crop being cultivated. As the amount of water a particular crop can consume is fixed, the total amount of precipitation determines whether there is any excess water to recharge the aquifer. Scanlon and others (2010b) found that most of the rainfed agriculture land in the Northern Ogallala Aquifer showed little or no recharge with the exception of an area of medium to coarse soil north of the Canadian River. The average recharge rate in the Northern Ogallala Aquifer was 0.42 inches per year with a maximum of 1.41 inches per year located in the coarser sand. In the Southern Ogallala Aquifer, the average recharge rate for rainfed agriculture was 0.94 inches per year. However, the region of Pullman clay loam in Potter County showed no evidence of current recharge at all (Scanlon and others, 2010b). Although unsaturated zone profiles have not been drilled in the Dockum Aquifer outcrop zones, rising water levels over past decades in the Colorado River outcrop of the Dockum Aquifer is assumed to be related to increased recharge under cultivated agricultural land (Ewing and others, 2008). Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that the impact of rainfed agriculture on Dockum Aquifer recharge is similar that in the Ogallala Aquifer. 4.4.3.4.2.2 Irrigated Agriculture Irrigation return flow can be a significant source of recharge, depending on the concentration of irrigation activities and the type of crops being grown. In general, current good agricultural management practices for most crops include balancing irrigation application with plant evapotranspiration requirements (for example, Allen and others, 1998), so that the amount of Final Conceptual Model Report for the High Plains Aquifer System Groundwater Availability Model 4.4-10 water that moves beyond the root zone to the water table below is minimized. Thus, a large amount of irrigation would be required to yield significant potential return flow. Irrigated cultivation makes up about 12 percent (Qi and others, 2002) to about 9 percent (Ozdogan and Gutman, 2008) of the total cultivated area of the Ogallala Aquifer. Irrigation is currently predominantly applied by center pivot systems. Irrigated boreholes have an average percolation rate of 1.6 inches per year in the Northern Ogallala Aquifer (Scanlon and others, 2010b). However, the presence of chloride bulges in these profiles indicates that the increased percolation from irrigation has not recharged the aquifer. The average percolation rate for irrigated boreholes was 1.9 inches per year in the Southern Ogallala Aquifer (Scanlon and others, 2010a). Enhanced percolation due to cultivation is evident in the southern portion of the Southern Ogallala Aquifer, below the 500 milligrams per liter contour for total dissolved solids, and increased nitrate levels are suggestive of an impact from irrigation return flow. There is limited irrigation in the outcrop zones of the Dockum Aquifer and as mentioned before, unsaturated borehole profiles were not drilled in this region. The recharge response to irrigation in the Dockum Aquifer outcrop is, therefore, assumed to be similar to that in nearby Ogallala Aquifer regions. 4.4.3.4.3 Urban Areas Approximately 4 percent of the Ogallala Aquifer area is developed land. The main urban centers in the region include Amarillo (population 190,695), Lubbock (population 229,573), and Midland-Odessa (population 211,087) (United States Census Bureau, 2010). Generally, urban areas are assumed to produce little recharge due to the abundance of paved and other impervious surfaces that prevent infiltration. However, in the Ogallala Aquifer, urban areas can actually indirectly lead to higher recharge. For instance, runoff from paved and other impervious areas of the City of Lubbock is directed to several local playas, which has resulted locally in enhanced recharge and increased groundwater levels (Kier and others, 1984; West, 1998). The effect of playas on recharge is discussed in the following section. 4.4.3.5 Focused Recharge from Surface Water Features Surface water in the Texas High Plains is dominated by playas, or ephemeral lakes. There are 30,625 playas greater than 1 acre in size that have been mapped within the model boundary area (Figure 4.4.6). Of these, 29,674 (97 percent) are located within the Ogallala Aquifer model Final Conceptual Model Report for the High Plains Aquifer System Groundwater Availability Model 4.4-11 boundary area and range from 1 to 580 acres (median 7.3 acres, mean 13.3 acres). Playa floors cover a total area of 396,000 acres in the Ogallala Aquifer model area, representing approximately 1 percent of the surface area.

Playa floors cover a total area of 396,000 acres in the Ogallala Aquifer model area, representing approximately 1 percent of the surface area. In many areas of the Southern Ogallala Aquifer, playas are arranged along sub-parallel, en echelon lineaments generally trending northwest- southeast. Playas were considered evaporation ponds until the 1960s. However, unsaturated zone studies conducted beneath individual playas in the 1990s showed that playas are actually important sources of recharge to the aquifer (Wood and Sandford, 1995a; Scanlon and Goldsmith, 1997). Tracking bomb pulse tritium under selected playas suggested recharge rates ranging from 3 to 4.7 inches per year (Scanlon and Goldsmith, 1997; Wood and others, 1997). Playa recharge becomes additionally important because the playas of the High Plains are largely located in areas that have otherwise very low recharge rates, such as restrictive clay loams or loams with > 25 percent clay content (see Figure 4.4.6). Mullican and others (1997) showed that the localized recharge under individual playas results in increased regional recharge at the water table. Using the chloride mass balance rate approach, they estimated that playas contributed 0.4 inches per year to the regional groundwater recharge in the northern portion of the Southern Ogallala Aquifer. Model simulations by Mullican and others (1997) showed that implementing playas as point sources of recharge versus an areally- distributed source of recharge had little effect on the final recharge rate at the water table. Therefore, for the purposes of this study, playa recharge is considered to be a diffuse source of recharge, dependent on playa density. Playa density, calculated as the percentage of playa area (based on the playa coverage shown in Figure 4.4.6) within a 1-mile radius, is zero for about 60 percent of the Ogallala Aquifer surface area (Figure 4.4.7). In areas where playas are found, playa density ranges up to a maximum of 47 percent, though 90 percent of these areas have values ranging from 0.1 to 6 percent. The highest playa densities fall in areas of restrictive Pullman clay loam northeast of Amarillo and along the eastern escarpment north of Lubbock in the Southern Ogallala Aquifer. The Northern Ogallala Aquifer has high playa density in the eastern lobes of restrictive Pullman and Sherm clay loam soils. Playas do occur in limited areas of the eastern Colorado River outcrop of the Dockum Aquifer but are not as widespread as in the Ogallala Aquifer (see Figure 4.4.7). Final Conceptual Model Report for the High Plains Aquifer System Groundwater Availability Model 4.4-12 4.4.3.6 Depth to Water The depth of the water table can significantly influence recharge because infiltrating water can more readily reach a shallow water table than a deeper one. If pumping draws down the water table, this can increase the travel time from the surface to the water table, decreasing the amount of recharge. Estimated pre-development water table depths are shown in Figure 4.4.8. Depth to water was calculated by subtracting the pre-development water level elevation (see Figure 4.3.12) from the 10- meter digital elevation model (see Figure 2.1.3). In the Ogallala Aquifer, the shallowest water tables occur in the few drainage networks and along the eastern and southern margins of the Northern Ogallala Aquifer. These generally correspond to areas of coarser-grained soil, which also makes them conducive to recharge. 4.4.4 Estimating Recharge 4.4.4.1 Natural Discharge In regions where the streams are gaining, the base flow component of stream flow (that is, stream flow that originates from groundwater) can provide a lower-bound estimate for recharge. However, as discussed in Section 4.5, the majority of streams in the study area are not gaining. Those that are gaining are generally highly regulated, resulting in estimates of base flow that do not reflect the natural recharge conditions of that area. Springflow can also provide an estimate of recharge when it is thought to be sourced from shallow formations. This is likely the case for many of the western springs in the Southern Ogallala Aquifer described in Section 4.5. However, many of these springs have since stopped flowing and few have measurements of springflow. There is not sufficient data to estimate recharge based on natural discharge values for the model area. 4.4.4.2 Chloride Mass Balance A mass balance method based on chloride (also called chloride mass balance can be used to estimate the unsaturated zone percolation or recharge rate (Allison and Hughes, 1983). According to the chloride mass balance method, chloride input from precipitation (P) and irrigation (I) balances chloride output in percolation (PeCMB) or recharge (RCMB): \u0732\u0741\u0bbc\u0bc6\u0bbb\u0d4c\u0734\u0bbc\u0bc6\u0bbb\u0d4c \u123a\u0bc9 \u0d48 \u0bbc\u0bdf\u0cc1\u123b\u0b3e\u123a\u0bc2 \u0d48 \u0bbc\u0bdf\u0cba\u123b \u0bbc\u0bdf\u0cc6\u0ccb (4.4.1) Final Conceptual Model Report for the High Plains Aquifer System Groundwater Availability Model 4.4-13 where ClP, ClI, and ClUZ are the chloride concentrations of precipitation, irrigation water, and unsaturated zone pore water, respectively. Similarly, the CMB method can be used to estimate the groundwater recharge rate (RGW) for the saturated zone: R\u0b4b\u0b5b\u0d4c \u0b54 \u0d48 \u0b47\u0b6a\u0c4c \u0b47\u0b6a\u0c43\u0c53 (4.4.2) where ClGW is the chloride concentration in groundwater. The distribution of chloride concentrations in precipitation were estimated spatially based on sample information from the National Atmospheric Deposition Program (2013) for a national network of monitoring stations. Monitoring at different stations began in the late 1970s to the early 1980s. The National Atmospheric Deposition Program concentrations were doubled to account for dry fallout, which is consistent with total chloride fallout according to pre-bomb 36Cl/Cl ratios in Amarillo, Texas (Scanlon and Goldsmith, 1997). Recharge rates derived from chloride mass balance in clay-rich areas of the Southern Ogallala Aquifer are generally about 0.3 inches per year. In clay-rich areas of the Northern Ogallala Aquifer, chloride mass balance recharge rates range from about 0.4 inches per year south of the Canadian River to about 0.5 inches per year"

The National Atmospheric Deposition Program concentrations were doubled to account for dry fallout, which is consistent with total chloride fallout according to pre-bomb 36Cl/Cl ratios in Amarillo, Texas (Scanlon and Goldsmith, 1997). Recharge rates derived from chloride mass balance in clay-rich areas of the Southern Ogallala Aquifer are generally about 0.3 inches per year. In clay-rich areas of the Northern Ogallala Aquifer, chloride mass balance recharge rates range from about 0.4 inches per year south of the Canadian River to about 0.5 inches per year north of the Canadian River (Scanlon and others, 2010b). In less clay-rich regions of the Northern Ogallala Aquifer, recharge is about 0.3 inches per year in the northwest and 0.3 to 0.4 inches per year in loamy regions to the east. Recharge can be up to 0.65 inches per year in sandy areas located in the Canadian River area and along the smaller drainage networks in the eastern and northern parts of the region. High natural groundwater chloride concentrations are present in the Southern Ogallala Aquifer due to mixing with more saline water from underlying formations. As a result, the chloride mass balance method cannot be used on groundwater chloride concentrations, as it does not provide valid estimates of groundwater recharge in this region. However, it can be applied to unsaturated zone profiles, as these are unaffected by cross-formational flow. Median recharge rates derived from unsaturated zone profiles range from 0.94 inches per year under rainfed agricultural areas (Scanlon and others, 2007) to 1.9 inches per year under irrigated agricultural areas (Scanlon and others, 2010a). Final Conceptual Model Report for the High Plains Aquifer System Groundwater Availability Model 4.4-14 4.4.4.3 Hydrograph Analysis Water table fluctuations can be used as a measure of recharge, particularly in areas that are not unduly influenced by large-scale pumping (Healy and Cook, 2002). Under appropriate conditions, water level increases can be used to estimate recharge rates based on the equation: R \u0d4cS\u0b77 \u0b7c\u0b66 \u0b7c\u0b72 (4.4.3) where R is the recharge rate, Sy is aquifer specific yield, \uf044h is water table elevation change, and \uf044t is the time over which the water table elevation change occurred. A uniform estimated specific yield value of 0.15 is assumed for this study. In the Northern Ogallala Aquifer and the northern portion of the Southern Ogallala Aquifer , hydrographs for wells located in agricultural areas with finer grained soils generally showed long-term groundwater level declines attributed to irrigation pumping (Scanlon and others, 2010a, b). This indicates that recharge in these areas is insufficient to replace water lost to pumping. However, in coarse textured soils along the southeast margins of the Northern Ogallala Aquifer and in the southern portion of the Southern Ogallala Aquifer, persistent periods of rising water levels indicated the occurrence of significant aquifer recharge. Based on the hydrographs, recharge rates range from 0.17 to 2.66 inches per year (median 0.55 inches per year) in the Northern Ogallala Aquifer (Scanlon and others, 2010b) and 0.4 to 4.8 inches per year (median 2.2 inches per year) in the Southern Ogallala Aquifer (Scanlon and others, 2005c). 4.4.4.4 Groundwater Nitrate Concentrations Concentrations of nitrate in groundwater can be used to detect and estimate the occurrence of aquifer recharge. Following initial cultivation, soil moisture content increases, resulting in enhanced bacterial growth and conversion of soil organic nitrogen to nitrate, which generally occurs in the shallowest 0.3 m of the soil horizon (Scanlon and others, 2008). Assuming that soil texture does not inhibit percolation, increasing water percolation will mobilize that nitrate and other soluble ions to depths below the root zone and eventually the water table. This behavior was observed in the High Plains as peaks of nitrate and chloride displaced lower than expected compared to natural setting profiles (Scanlon and others, 2008). If this downward mobilization process continues for a sufficient period to allow for flushing of nitrate through the unsaturated zone, nitrate reaches the groundwater. Under natural conditions, the maximum natural groundwater concentration of nitrate is expected to be 4 milligrams per liter (Gurdak and Qi, Final Conceptual Model Report for the High Plains Aquifer System Groundwater Availability Model 4.4-15 2006). Thus, the presence of nitrate concentrations greater than 4 milligrams per liter can be used as an indicator of recharge. Figure 4.4.9 shows the probability of groundwater nitrate concentrations exceeding 4 milligrams per liter in the Ogallala Aquifer. Nitrate concentrations are available for 2,032 groundwater wells completed in the Ogallala Aquifer in Texas. For each well, only the most recent sample was used in order to represent current conditions. Only samples after 1988 were used, with an average sample date of 2000. Indicator kriging was used to estimate the spatial distribution of nitrate. Rather than attempt to estimate actual concentrations as is performed with either the simple or ordinary methods of kriging, the indicator method generates estimates of the probability of exceeding a stated threshold value, in this case, a threshold of 4 milligrams per liter nitrate consistent with Gurdak and Qi (2006). The method assigns a value of 0 (zero) to points that are at or below the threshold and a value of 1 to \u201cindicate\u201d points that exceed the threshold. As with other forms of kriging, a variogram is used to describe any spatial correlation in the dataset. Indicator kriging has an advantage over other forms of kriging in that no assumptions are required regarding the normality of the data distribution. Additionally, non- detects or \u201cless-than\u201d analytical results can be used directly where the analytical method detection limit is less than the threshold value. Since very few non-Texas data points were available from the United States Geological Survey National Water Information System database (United States Geological Survey, 2013b), results of the indicator kriging are limited to the area covered by the TWDB database (TWDB, 2013). The results indicate that much of the southern half of the Southern Ogallala Aquifer region has an elevated probability (greater than 50 percent) of"

The results indicate that much of the southern half of the Southern Ogallala Aquifer region has an elevated probability (greater than 50 percent) of groundwater nitrate exceeding 4 milligrams per liter (Figure 4.4.9). Comparison of the nitrate probability map with the land use map (see Figure 4.4.5) indicates that the regions of elevated probability in the Southern Ogallala Aquifer region are closely and almost exclusively associated with areas of agricultural land use. Of the remaining regions in Texas, only the southeastern and eastern Northern Ogallala Aquifer margins show elevated probabilities. These regions are generally consistent with areas that are both cultivated and have coarser textured soils (see Figure 4.4.2). In the majority of the Northern Ogallala Aquifer and the northern portion of the Southern Ogallala Aquifer, where agricultural areas are associated with finer textured soils, elevated groundwater nitrate concentrations are less common and only occur locally. It is possible that the lower nitrate concentrations in the north Final Conceptual Model Report for the High Plains Aquifer System Groundwater Availability Model 4.4-16 are due to the widespread lowering of the water table due to large-scale irrigation. If this process significantly increased the thickness of the unsaturated zone, it would prolong the time required for nitrate to reach the water table, leading to the lower observed nitrate concentrations. However, this impact is only likely to occur in very limited agricultural areas with less clay-rich soils. The observed nitrate distributions indicate that recharge in the High Plains is controlled by both land use and soil texture. Recharge is more dependent on land use in the Southern Ogallala Aquifer region, where nitrate concentrations are elevated in areas associated with agriculture and low in areas dominated by rangeland. However, in the Northern Ogallala Aquifer region, recharge is relatively unaffected by land use but dependent on soil texture. Elevated nitrate concentrations are generally associated with areas of coarser textured soils and low nitrate concentrations occur in areas of finer grained soil even when that land is under cultivation. This is likely because agriculture in the Northern Ogallala Aquifer is predominantly located on clay rich soils, which limit recharge. Thus, conversion to agriculture has little effect on recharge. 4.4.4.5 Timing of Recharge Events Since elevated nitrate concentrations indicate the occurrence of recharge, time series of nitrate in groundwater, when available, can be used to constrain travel time of recharge from the surface to the water table. Figures 4.4.10 through 4.4.13 show multi-decadal time series of total dissolved solids and nitrate concentrations in the Southern Ogallala Aquifer in all or part of 19 Texas counties. The data used for this analysis was sourced from the TWDB groundwater database (TWDB, 2013). There were 4,828 total dissolved solids analyses and 4,510 nitrate analyses with dates ranging from the 1930s to the present. For this analysis, samples were first grouped spatially by county area. Sixteen of the counties have an average of 331 samples though time, ranging from 183 samples (Yoakum County) to 1,014 samples (Gaines County). Five counties (Borden, Crosby, Ector, Garza, and Glasscock counties) have relatively small areas in the region and too few water samples (17 to 68) for independent analysis and were, therefore, grouped with adjacent counties. Within each county or multi-county area, samples were then grouped by sequential decadal periods until there were generally a minimum of approximately 70 wells in each subpopulation to provide both statistical reliability and assumed spatial coverage within each area. This Final Conceptual Model Report for the High Plains Aquifer System Groundwater Availability Model 4.4-17 resulted in 3 to 4 time periods for each area. Concentration for the 50th, 75th, and 90th percentiles were plotted against time for both total dissolved solids and nitrate concentration (see Figures 4.4.10 through 4.4.13). These \u201cupper end\u201d percentile distributions were then used to estimate the general timing of widespread water quality impacts due to land use change. Results indicate that nitrate concentrations in agricultural areas became elevated above background early in Dawson and Borden counties (prior to 1940) and also in Lynn and Garza counties (prior to 1960). None of the remaining agricultural counties showed widespread impacts from nitrate prior to 1970 (Bailey, Cochran, Gaines, Hockley, Howard, Lamb, Lubbock, and Crosby counties) or 1980 (Lamb, Martin, Terry, and Yoakum counties) representing the earliest sample periods in those areas. Widespread impacts from nitrate in most areas outside of the Lynn and Dawson counties area generally began in the 1970s and 1980s, though impacts may have begun as late as the 1990s in Gaines, Lamb, Lubbock, Terry, and Yoakum counties. Cochran and Hockley counties appear to have had little impact from nitrate to date. In rangeland areas and areas with large urban/suburban areas (Lubbock, Andrews, Midland, Glasscock, and Ector counties), nitrate contributions due to agricultural recharge are expected to be minimal. Therefore, the elevated nitrate concentrations in these areas are not interpreted as evidence of agricultural recharge but, rather, as evidence of septic contamination. The fact that total dissolved solids concentrations do not increase simultaneously with nitrate, but remain relatively stable, supports this assumption. The rate at which nitrate and other soluble ions reach the water table is controlled by water inputs, including precipitation rates and irrigation rates, and by the unsaturated zone profile characteristics, including texture, layering, pre-existing moisture content, and overall thickness (that is, depth to the saturated zone). Figure 4.4.14 shows no evidence of correlation between soil type and the timing of recharge from land use change. Some areas with sandy soil, where recharge is expected to occur more rapidly, have some of the latest recharge dates. Other"

Figure 4.4.14 shows no evidence of correlation between soil type and the timing of recharge from land use change. Some areas with sandy soil, where recharge is expected to occur more rapidly, have some of the latest recharge dates. Other areas that share the same type of soil have vastly different recharge times. Land use, on the other hand, does have a clear influence on recharge travel time, with early recharge occurring under cropland and late recharge occurring under areas with less irrigated land. For instance, Cochran and Hockley counties, which have no evidence of recharge, contain primarily rangeland (Figure 4.4.15). Depth to water may also be a controlling factor for timing of recharge, as Final Conceptual Model Report for the High Plains Aquifer System Groundwater Availability Model 4.4-18 Cochran and Hockley counties are in areas where the water table is very deep (Figure 4.4.16). When recharge must travel a larger vertical distance, travel time to the water table increases. As shown by the inset graph in Figure 4.4.16, the timing of recharge becomes progressively later as the water table get deeper. While the correlation is not 1:1, an upward trend can be seen in the plot. 4.4.5 Pre-development Recharge Distribution (pre-1930) Prior to the agricultural development of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, recharge to the Ogallala Aquifer was generally restricted to focused flow beneath playas. Otherwise, in areas with no playas, the native vegetation intercepted most precipitation and prevented any significant recharge from occurring. In the Northern Ogallala Aquifer, however, some interplaya recharge may have occurred in regions dominated by coarse textured soils, like those along drainages and along the eastern and southern margins of the Northern Ogallala Aquifer. These areas of coarse- textured soil tend to correspond with areas where the upper sections of the Ogallala Formation have been removed by erosion and the coarser lower sections are exposed at the surface, enhancing recharge potential. Recharge to the northern section of the Southern Ogallala Aquifer appears to be similarly influenced by soil type. However, the same is not true of the southern portion of the Southern Ogallala Aquifer, where soil type does not appear to affect recharge. There, coarse-textured soils, like those in the southwest margins of the Southern Ogallala Aquifer, represent surficial eolian deposits that are underlain by less permeable layers, limiting recharge potential. Unsaturated zone profiles in this area support the assumption that no recharge has occurred in these interplaya areas since the Pleistocene. To account for these differences, the Southern Ogallala Aquifer was split into two distinct sections for the current recharge analysis. The delineation of these two areas is based on Scanlon and others (2010a), which splits the Southern Ogallala Aquifer using salinity, with the 500 milligrams per liter total dissolved solids contour (Figure 4.4.17) marking the boundary between the higher salinity southern portion and the fresher northern portion. This delineation also coincides with other physical transitions that affect how recharge occurs on either side of the boundary. The northern portion is a paleovalley with high saturated thicknesses and a deep water table while the southern portion is a paleoupland with low saturated thicknesses and a shallow water table (Scanlon and others, 2010a). Final Conceptual Model Report for the High Plains Aquifer System Groundwater Availability Model 4.4-19 Because of these differences, the initial pre-development recharge distribution groups together the Northern Ogallala Aquifer and the northern portion of the Southern Ogallala Aquifer and applies recharge in these areas differently than in the southern portion of the Southern Ogallala Aquifer. Due to the larger number of samples in the north, it was possible to use the chloride mass balance method to determine pre-development recharge rates and then extrapolate these point values to the whole grid according to soil type. Based on the groundwater chloride mass balance method, pre-development recharge rates ranged from 0.3 to 0.6 inches per year in the Northern Ogallala Aquifer and from to 0.2 to 0.4 inches per year in the northern part of the Southern Ogallala Aquifer (Figure 4.4.17). In the south, there were not enough chloride mass balance data points to create a recharge distribution. However, there is a decreasing regional trend in recharge rates as you move south. Extending that trend based on northern values, predevelopment recharge rates in the southern region are estimated to be about 0.1 to 0.2 inches per year, but this recharge is restricted to areas with playas. To account for the control that playas have on recharge in this region, recharge was distributed according to the playa density shown in Figure 4.4.7. Areas with 0 percent playa density were assigned a minimal value of 0.007 inches per year, based on the calibrated value from Blandford and others (2008). Although there is no measured evidence of recharge happening in these non-playa areas, the record of some springs in the western portion of the Ogallala Aquifer indicates a non-zero amount of recharge. Where playas are present, a recharge value of 0.1 inches per year was assigned to areas with less than 5 percent playa density, 0.15 inches per year to areas with 5 to 20 percent playa density, and 0.2 inches per year to areas with playa density greater than 20 percent (Figure 4.4.17). For the Dockum Aquifer, the current study uses the same pre-development recharge distribution as Ewing and others (2008). This conceptualization assumes no deep recharge to the confined portion of the aquifer. Instead, all recharge is shallow and eventually discharged to local drainages. Recharge rates were distributed according to local topography and average 0.15 inches per year (Figure 4.4.18). In the western portion of the Colorado River outcrop (Borden, Dawson, and Garza"

For the Dockum Aquifer, the current study uses the same pre-development recharge distribution as Ewing and others (2008). This conceptualization assumes no deep recharge to the confined portion of the aquifer. Instead, all recharge is shallow and eventually discharged to local drainages. Recharge rates were distributed according to local topography and average 0.15 inches per year (Figure 4.4.18). In the western portion of the Colorado River outcrop (Borden, Dawson, and Garza counties), the total dissolved solids concentration is greater than 5,000 milligrams per liter. This high salinity value and the high clay content of the soil suggest negligible recharge in this portion of the outcrop. A small area of Ogallala Formation sediments intersects the Dockum Aquifer in the Colorado River outcrop. It is hydraulically isolated from Final Conceptual Model Report for the High Plains Aquifer System Groundwater Availability Model 4.4-20 the Ogallala Aquifer and acts as a source of recharge for the Dockum Aquifer. This is assigned a recharge value of 0.04 inches per year according to estimates in Ewing and others (2008). 4.4.6 Post-Development Recharge Distribution (1930 to present) In the Northern Ogallala Aquifer and the northern section of the Southern Ogallala Aquifer, unsaturated zone borehole profiles indicate that the conversion to cultivated agricultural land has had little to no impact on recharge. This is likely due to the clustering of cultivated lands in areas dominated by clay loam soils. These relatively impermeable soils restrict the effects of agricultural activity to the shallowest 10 to 20 feet of the unsaturated zone and preclude any significant deep recharge. Some of the borehole profiles from Scanlon and others (2010b) indicate that enhanced percolation occurs under irrigated agriculture, but this percolation has not occurred at a rate sufficient to have reached the water table. The lack of elevated nitrate concentrations in the groundwater in this region supports this conclusion (Figure 4.4.9). So agricultural activity, including irrigation, has not led to enhanced recharge in the Northern Ogallala Aquifer and the northern section of the Southern Ogallala Aquifer. These regions have recharge that is effectively unchanged since pre-development. The post-development recharge distribution used in the Northern Ogallala Aquifer and the northern portion of the Southern Ogallala Aquifer region in this study are, thus, the same as the pre-development distribution (Figure 4.4.19). By contrast, recharge in the southern portion of the Southern Ogallala Aquifer has been impacted by conversion to cultivated agriculture. Whereas pre-development recharge was limited to playa areas, post-development recharge occurs under rainfed and irrigated agricultural lands. Local areas of increasing water levels under cultivated lands are indicators of this effect. Irrigation return flow can be delayed by years to decades due to physical factors influencing recharge travel time, most notably depth to water table. For this reason, recharge might occur much later than the actual application of irrigation at the surface. Chloride mass balance recharge values for unsaturated zone borehole profiles in cultivated agricultural land range from 0.2 to 4.4 inches per year, with a median of 0.94 inches per year for rainfed and 1.9 inches per year for irrigated profiles. Therefore, in the southern portion of the Southern Ogallala Aquifer, post-development recharge is distributed based on the land use distribution shown in Figure 4.4.5. In areas where there has been no agricultural development, the recharge is assumed to be unchanged from pre- development recharge (Figure 4.4.19). Final Conceptual Model Report for the High Plains Aquifer System Groundwater Availability Model 4.4-21 During the development of the numerical model, we will look at the sensitivity of heads to delaying the effect of irrigation return flow to when evidence of nitrate breakthrough occurred. That is, in the year when nitrate breakthrough occurred in a given county, we can increase the recharge rate from a rainfed value to an irrigated value. For example, because of the early evidence of breakthrough in Dawson County, elevated recharge will be applied near the beginning of the historical simulation, which will help to match the steady or increasing water levels in that area. The recharge distribution shown in Figure 4.4.19 does not show the impact of runoff from impervious cover in the City of Lubbock to nearby playas. We recognize that in calibration, additional focused recharge that represents a few individual playas may be required to match local hydrographs, similar to Blandford and others (2008). The current study uses the same post-development recharge distribution for the Dockum Aquifer as adopted by Ewing and others (2008). Their conceptualization attributes increases in water levels in the Colorado River outcrop to agricultural land use change and assumes an additional 1.45 inches of recharge in cropland areas. They implemented this increased recharge in the model grid by adding additional recharge, up to 1.45 inches, to the pre-development recharge rates of grid cells, weighted by the amount of cropland falling in that grid cell (Figure 4.4.20). No distinction between rainfed and irrigated cropland was made. The recharge distribution in the Canadian River outcrop remains unchanged from pre-development conditions. In this region, little cultivation has occurred and stable water levels indicate little to no effect on recharge due to land use change (Ewing and others, 2008). Cropland areas in the area of isolated Ogallala Formation sediments are assigned a recharge value of 0.94 inches per year, the same as rainfed agriculture in the Ogallala Aquifer.

Final Conceptual Model Report for the High Plains Aquifer System Groundwater Availability Model 4.5-1 4.5 Rivers, Streams, Springs, and Lakes The interaction between groundwater and surface water occurs at the locations of rivers, streams, springs, and lakes. Rivers and streams can either lose water to the underlying aquifer, resulting in aquifer recharge, or gain water from the underlying aquifer, resulting in aquifer discharge. Springs or seeps occur where the water table intersects the ground surface and there is discharge from an aquifer. Lakes can provide a potential site of focused recharge to an aquifer. Generally, direct exchange between surface water and groundwater is limited to areas where a surface water feature intersects the aquifer outcrop. For the purposes of this study, the entire extent of the Ogallala Aquifer is considered outcrop, given its unconfined nature. However, surface water-groundwater interaction in the Dockum and Rita Blanca aquifers is assumed to be limited to the outcrop area. The Edwards-Trinity (High Plains) Aquifer does not outcrop within the study area and so is not considered a site of any major recharge or discharge. 4.5.1 Rivers and Streams Three major rivers cross the study area: the Beaver (North Canadian), Canadian, and Pecos rivers (Figure 4.5.1). The Cimarron River drains the northernmost tip of the study area and forms the northern boundary for our model. Headwaters of the Washita, North Fork Red, Prairie Dog Town Fork Red, White, Double Mountain Fork Brazos, and Colorado rivers also drain the easternmost portion of the study area. This analysis focuses on identifying and quantifying the potential groundwater-surface water interaction occurring in areas where these rivers intersect aquifer outcrops. Potential sites for the Ogallala Aquifer include portions of the Cimarron, Beaver, Canadian, Washita, North Fork Red, Prairie Dog Town Fork Red, White, and Double Mountain Fork Brazos rivers. Potential sites for the Dockum Aquifer included portions of the Canadian, Colorado, Double Mountain Fork Brazos, White, and Prairie Dog Town Fork Red rivers. No major rivers intersect the Rita Blanca Aquifer outcrop. While the southern portion of the Ogallala Aquifer has no major perennial rivers, it does have several major intermittent drainages, or \"draws\", most of which were formerly spring fed. The location of these draws may be controlled by underlying geologic structure, as they generally follow the northwest-southeast orientation of principal lineament trends (Fallin, 1989; Reeves and Reeves, 1996). Figure 4.5.1 shows the location of major draws overlying the southern Final Conceptual Model Report for the High Plains Aquifer System Groundwater Availability Model 4.5-2 portion of the Ogallala Aquifer. When flowing, Palo Duro, Frio, Tierra Blanca, and Tule creeks drain to the Red River; Running Water, Catfish, Blackwater, and Yellow House draws drain to the Brazos River; and Sulphur Springs, McKenzie, Sulphur, Lost, Wardswell, Seminole, Monument, Mustang, Midland, Johnson, and Monahans draws drain to the Colorado River. Though these draws are not currently important sources of surface water, they are useful in that they do show where springs likely occurred prior to groundwater development. Figure 4.5.2 shows the locations of United States Geological Survey stream gages in the model area. Figure 4.5.3 shows hydrographs from select gages located on major rivers in the study area. The Cimarron River is the least flashy, in that the others show variations over orders of magnitude in daily flow. This trend is consistent with the precipitation distribution in the area (see Figure 2.1.6). Since precipitation is greater in the north, the recharge and, thus, base flow, should be steadier. In the north, the Cimarron and Canadian rivers are perennial, containing non- zero flow more than 97 percent of the time. Since precipitation decreases towards the south, the southern rivers are expected to be more sensitive to rain-runoff events, causing the dramatic spikes seen in the hydrographs on the Colorado and Brazos rivers. There is also less base flow expected under drier conditions, which would account for the dips seen in these hydrographs as well. They are both intermittent, containing no flow greater than 10 percent of the time. Since it is also located in the south, the Pecos River should also be intermittent. However, it is perennial at gage 08412500 and does not display as much variation in flow as the other southern rivers because its flow is regulated upstream by Red Bluff Reservoir. There are no literature values available for streambed conductance in the model area. Due to uncertainty and considerations of scale, streambed conductance is typically a calibration parameter for regional groundwater models. 4.5.1.1 Gain/Loss Studies Gain/loss studies are used to estimate gaining or losing conditions in a stream by performing a flow balance between two stream control points. The net gain, or loss, of flow between the two control points is attributed to stream gain or loss. The studies are performed at low-flow conditions because"

The net gain, or loss, of flow between the two control points is attributed to stream gain or loss. The studies are performed at low-flow conditions because this method assumes that surface runoff is negligible. It is also important to characterize the timing, quantity and downstream propagation of all diversions and return flows occurring over the period of the study. Two reports documenting historical stream gain/loss Final Conceptual Model Report for the High Plains Aquifer System Groundwater Availability Model 4.5-3 studies were reviewed and summarized for Texas. The first is Slade and others (2002) who compiled the results of United States Geological Survey gain/loss studies conducted in Texas, and the second is by Baldys and Schalla (2011) who studied aquifer-stream interaction on the Brazos River. The Hemphill County Underground Water Conservation District also provided low-flow measurements collected during a water rights acquisition study (R.W. Harden and Associates, 2013). 4.5.1.1.1 United States Geological Survey Streamflow Gain-Loss Studies in Texas (Slade and others, 2002) A comprehensive compilation of gain/loss studies in Texas was completed by Slade and others (2002). This compilation contains the results of 366 gain/loss studies conducted since 1918, which include 249 individual stream reaches throughout Texas. They document 14 gain/loss studies intersecting the High Plains Aquifer System (Figure 4.5.4). These studies are all located in the southern portion of the active model area and there are none on the Canadian River or above. There are five studies that include reaches that cross the Ogallala Aquifer and 12 studies that cross the Dockum Aquifer outcrop. Tables 4.5.1 and 4.5.2 summarize the results of the gain/loss studies crossing the Ogallala and Dockum aquifers, respectively. According to the compiled low-flow studies, Tierra Blanca Creek (studies 250 and 251) is consistently losing as it crosses the Ogallala Aquifer. Beals Creek (studies 37 through 39) alternates between losing and gaining reaches over the Ogallala Aquifer, but is also losing on average. Beals Creek transitions to slightly gaining as it crosses the Dockum Aquifer outcrop. Earlier studies of the Colorado River (studies 45 through 48, 52) show slightly gaining conditions over the Dockum Aquifer outcrop, but more recent studies (studies 42 through 44) indicate slightly losing conditions. The stretch of the Prairie Dog Town Fork Red River that crosses the Dockum Aquifer (study 247) is slightly gaining on average. It is important to remember that gain-loss studies represent a snapshot of the river at a given time, rather than a long-term average. Streams can change both temporally (for example, be both gaining and losing within the same year) and spatially (for example, have a gaining stretch followed by a losing stretch). Inconsistencies can arise because analyzed measurements are typically recorded over a relatively short time span, but base flow has a strong climatically driven temporal component. This becomes problematic since groundwater flow models generally try to reproduce the average stream-aquifer interaction that may be integrated over a Final Conceptual Model Report for the High Plains Aquifer System Groundwater Availability Model 4.5-4 season or even a year. So we should be cautious in using the result from a gain/loss study as an average base flow to compare to model results. 4.5.1.1.2 United States Geological Survey Gain/Loss Studies for the Brazos River (Baldys and Schalla, 2011) The United States Geological Survey conducted stream flow gain and loss measurements in 2010 and base flow analyses for 1966 to 2009 along the Brazos River and its tributaries (Baldys and Schalla, 2011). The study extended from the New Mexico-Texas state line to Waco, Texas. The gages they analyzed for gain/loss studies within the active model boundary are shown in Figure 4.5.5 and summarized in Table 4.5.3, along with their analysis results. None of the gages used in their base flow analysis fall within our study area. Seasonal measurements of discharge and specific conductance were made in June and October 2010 along the Brazos River and its tributaries in order to characterize the gaining or losing nature of the stream. The study found that sites on the Salt Fork intersecting the Ogallala Aquifer have no flow in either season (sites SF 1 through 3), indicating no base flow input. The one site overlying the Dockum Aquifer outcrop (SF-4) has scant flow in both seasons, indicating some base flow input but very little. On the Double Mountain Fork Brazos River, two sites overlying the Ogallala Aquifer (DMF 1 and 2) have no flow in either season, but the two sites in the Dockum Aquifer outcrop (DMF 3 and 4) have flow in both seasons. However, this gain is attributed to discharges from the City of Lubbock's well field rather than to base flow input. The stretch between these two sites is actually a losing stretch. Another site on the South Fork Double Mountain Fork Brazos River also located in the Dockum Aquifer outcrop, contains some flow in October but not June, indicating some base flow input from the Dockum Aquifer, but again very little. 4.5.1.1.3 Hemphill County Surface Water Flow Measurements (R.W. Harden and Associates, 2013) As part of Mesa Water's water rights acquisition and permitting process, R.W. Harden and Associates (2013) collected streamflow measurements at six sites on the Canadian and Washita rivers as well as Gageby and Wolf creeks (Figure 4.5.5 and Table 4.5.4). Streamflow was measured quarterly from December 2006 to March 2010, except during periods when total flow was not representative of base flow due to rain, high flow, or restricted flow.

Harden and Associates, 2013) As part of Mesa Water's water rights acquisition and permitting process, R.W. Harden and Associates (2013) collected streamflow measurements at six sites on the Canadian and Washita rivers as well as Gageby and Wolf creeks (Figure 4.5.5 and Table 4.5.4). Streamflow was measured quarterly from December 2006 to March 2010, except during periods when total flow was not representative of base flow due to rain, high flow, or restricted flow. Because these Final Conceptual Model Report for the High Plains Aquifer System Groundwater Availability Model 4.5-5 measurements do not take into account delayed discharge, in-stream storage capacity or evapotranspiration, they only offer approximate base flow estimates. In addition, there is no gain/loss analysis provided for the stretches of river between measurement points. Wolf Creek (WC) and Gageby Creek (GC) have no sequential gages that would allow a gain/loss calculation, but since both seem to have perennial flow, we can assume that a portion of these creeks at or above the measurement point must be gaining. The Washita River has sequential gages (WR-4 and WR-5), but there are too few base flow measurements to allow a reliable gain/loss calculation. The few data points that are available seem to indicate that that stretch is losing. The Canadian River between sites CR-1 and CR-2 appears to be gaining according to base flow measurements. However, it is unclear whether or not there are other tributaries or sources of water contributing to that stretch. These low-flow values are, therefore, useful in establishing bounds for seasonal groundwater input to these streams but can't be used as quantitative base flow targets in our model. 4.5.1.2 Hydrograph Separation Studies Hydrograph separation is a methodology whereby stream flow hydrograph data are analyzed and surface runoff is partitioned from the stream base flow component. The basic premise of this method is that the sharp peaks in the stream flow hydrograph represent surface runoff events, and the smooth, constant portion of the stream flow hydrograph represents base flow. The base flow for a stream is then assumed to be flow supplied by groundwater. There are several automated methods available to perform the hydrograph separation. Figure 4.5.6 shows the results of the hydrograph separation code Base Flow Index (Wahl and Wahl, 1995) for streamflow gage 07301410 located on Sweetwater Creek near Kelton, Texas in Wheeler County. This figure shows a relatively steady base flow component across orders of magnitude changes in overall flow. Once base flow is estimated using hydrograph separation, an estimated shallow areal recharge flux can be calculated by dividing the estimated base flow rate by the drainage area. However, a new hydrograph separation study and recharge calculation was not attempted in the current study. Accurate base flow calculation depends on a stream being perennial and unregulated by diversions or dams. The recharge calculation assumes that the actual contributing area is the same as the total topographically-defined drainage area, which is not necessarily the case in an arid environment. Only three of the United States Geological Survey gages in the area were perennial, with at least 10 years of flow data unregulated by diversion or dams, and had a Final Conceptual Model Report for the High Plains Aquifer System Groundwater Availability Model 4.5-6 contributing area that matched the total drainage area. Since these were small watersheds at the edge of the study area, they are not likely to be representative of much of the High Plains Aquifer System. The following section briefly summarizes another historical base flow analysis conducted in the active model area (Wolock, 2003a,b). 4.5.1.3 United States Geological Survey Conterminous United States Baseflow Study (Wolock, 2003a,b) In 2003, the United States Geological Survey published a study for the entire conterminous United States that estimated the base flow component of streamflow at more than 19,000 United States Geological Survey stream gages (Wolock, 2003a). These point estimate values were then used to interpolate a 1-km grid raster dataset of base-flow index values that could be used to estimate base-flow index values even for streams with no gaged data (Wolock, 2003b). The base-flow index is the ratio of base flow to total stream flow, expressed as a percentage. The estimates of stream base flow were calculated using the Base Flow Index code (Wahl and Wahl, 1995). Figure 4.5.7 plots the gage estimated base-flow index ratios in the study area after Wolock (2003a,b). In general, the base-flow index values in the northeastern and southeastern corners are higher than elsewhere in the model area, indicating a larger groundwater contribution. This is expected as these areas also generally receive more precipitation than the rest of the area (see Figure 2.1.6). Overall, the base-flow index values in the model area are all greater than zero, which indicates that most streams are on average and over the long term, gaining streams. However, this is inconsistent with the high number of ephemeral streams, particularly in the central-western portion of the model area. This inconsistency is likely due to the fact that none of the gages on these west-central ephemeral draws was included in the analysis (Figure 4.5.7). The study also does not discriminate between regulated and un-regulated gages so, while it is helpful for establishing an approximate spatial distribution of base flow, these numbers cannot be used as quantitative base flow targets for the model. 4.5.2 Springs Springs are locations where the water table intersects the ground surface.

In Texas, spring information was taken from the TWDB groundwater database (TWDB, 2013), Brune (2002), and a United States Geological Survey database of Texas springs reported in Heitmuller and Reece (2003). In New Mexico, spring information was taken from White and Kues (1992). In Oklahoma, spring information came from the United States Geological Survey National Water Information System database (United States Geological Survey, 2013b). Figure 4.5.8 shows the locations of springs that flow or formerly flowed in the study area. Springs with recorded flow measurements are circled in black. The literature identified 666 springs or groups of springs in the study area, of which 194 flow out of the Ogallala Aquifer, 96 out of the Dockum Aquifer, three out of the Edwards-Trinity (High Plains) Aquifer and eight out of the Rita Blanca Aquifer. Six springs flowed from a combination of Ogallala and Dockum aquifers and three had sources described as a combination of Ogallala and Rita Blanca aquifers. The remainder flow from alluvium, formations older than the Dockum Aquifer, or unknown sources and so are not used in this discussion. Many of the Ogallala Aquifer springs are located along the Eastern Caprock Escarpment (eastern edge of the active model boundary in figure) or clustered along draws in the central portion of the study area. As mentioned earlier, most draws in the area are, or formerly were, spring fed. Many of the Dockum Aquifer springs are also located along the Eastern Caprock Escarpment in addition to the Canadian and Colorado River outcrop areas. Recorded flow measurements from springs in the study area are given in Table 4.5.5. One hundred and eighteen springs do, or at one time did, discharge at a rate greater than or equal to 100 gallons per minute (0.22 cubic feet per second). Figure 4.5.9 shows hydrographs from Roaring Springs and Chicken Springs, which both have multi-decadal time series of measured discharge. Roaring Springs, which issues from the Dockum Aquifer in Motley County, had a measured high flow of 1,125.4 gallons per minute (2.51 cubic feet per second) in 1946. The hydrograph indicates a decline in discharge from about 1945 to about 1960 but relatively stable discharge since that time to the end of the record in 1978. Chicken Springs, which flows from the Ogallala and Dockum aquifers in Potter County, had a measured high flow of 1,521.6 gallons per minute (3.39 cubic feet per second) in 1956. Discharge from Chicken Springs steadily declined between about 1956 and 1962 and remained relatively stable from 1962 to 1978. Final Conceptual Model Report for the High Plains Aquifer System Groundwater Availability Model 4.5-8 Throughout much of the state, including the study area, spring flows have shown a general decline over time. Brune (2002) notes that declining water levels due to pumping has resulted in reduced flow in many of the springs. However, most information regarding spring declines for minor springs is anecdotal and undocumented. Table 4.5.5 shows that only 74 springs have two or more recorded flow measurements. Of the springs with more than one measurement, 57 show declining flow over time. The flow from several springs has stopped and the springs have become dry or flow has reduced such that the springs are now just seeps. However, much of the data are point measurements and in some cases, the only available measurements were taken months apart and so are not indicative of longer-term trends. In addition, the data do not extend to the present, so the available measurements do not necessarily represent the current condition of these springs. Information on springs with no recorded flow measurements is given in Table 4.5.6. Though lacking quantitative discharge data, they are still useful for creating our conceptual model. Because their locations are known, elevations were assigned based on the 10-m digital elevation model (see Figure 2.1.3) and used to constrain the pre-development water levels presented in Section 4.3. 4.5.3 Lakes and Reservoirs There are no natural perennial lakes in the study area. However, eighteen reservoirs intersect the model area, thirteen of which have areas greater than one square mile (640 acres). Table 4.5.7 lists the names, owners, area, and year impounded for these reservoirs. Of these, eight overlie the Ogallala Aquifer, eight overlie the Dockum Aquifer outcrop, and one overlies both. Red Bluff Reservoir, one of the largest reservoirs intersecting the study area, overlies the Pecos Valley Aquifer. Figure 4.5.10 shows the locations of the reservoirs. Figure 4.5.11 shows the historical lake stage elevations from the United States Geological Survey National Water Information System database (United States Geological Survey, 2013b) for three of the reservoirs. The hydrograph for Lake Meredith, which intersects the Ogallala Aquifer, shows elevation fluctuations from about 2,842 to 2,909 feet above mean sea level with an average value of about 2,879 feet above mean sea level. The hydrograph for Red Bluff Reservoir, which intersects the Pecos Valley Aquifer, shows elevation fluctuations from about 2,795 to 2,824 feet above mean sea level with an average value of about 2,811 feet above mean sea level. The Final Conceptual Model Report for the High Plains Aquifer System Groundwater Availability Model 4.5-9 hydrograph for Lake Colorado City, which intersects the Dockum Aquifer outcrop, shows elevation fluctuations from about 2,049 to 2,072 feet above mean sea level with an average value of about 2,061 feet above mean sea level. Lake Meredith has shown the steadiest decline, losing almost 70 feet of elevation since 2000. But Red Bluff Reservoir and Lake Colorado City have also shown declines of tens of feet in recent years. The reservoirs located in outcrop areas provide potential locations for focused recharge to or discharge from the underlying aquifers.

Lake Meredith has shown the steadiest decline, losing almost 70 feet of elevation since 2000. But Red Bluff Reservoir and Lake Colorado City have also shown declines of tens of feet in recent years. The reservoirs located in outcrop areas provide potential locations for focused recharge to or discharge from the underlying aquifers. Natural saline lakes and playa lakes, both of which are common in the High Plains, are also areas of potential surface water interaction with aquifers. There are nearly 40 larger saline lakes overlying the Southern Ogallala Aquifer (Wood and Jones, 1990; Reeves and Reeves, 1996). The names and locations of these lakes are shown in Table 4.5.8 and Figure 4.5.10, respectively. Saline lakes provide potential sites for shallow aquifer discharge. They occur in topographic depressions typically characterized by erosion of the Ogallala Formation on top of a topographic high in the underlying Cretaceous deposits. They are fed by precipitation runoff and shallow groundwater discharge from the Ogallala Aquifer and occasionally the Edwards-Trinity (High Plains) Aquifer. The total dissolved solids concentration can be significantly higher in these lakes compared to the Ogallala Aquifer due to evaporation (Wood and Jones, 1990). There are also thousands of small playa lakes distributed across the study area (see Figure 4.5.10). These are fed by precipitation runoff and since most lie above the water table, they can provide potential sites for significant aquifer recharge. These can be particularly important in low permeability areas with little to no other sources of recharge. The impact of playas on recharge to the High Plains Aquifer System is discussed in further detail in Section 4.4.3.5.

Final Conceptual Model Report for the High Plains Aquifer System Groundwater Availability Model 4.6-1 4.6 Hydraulic Properties Because adjusting aquifer hydraulic properties is an integral part of model calibration, it is important to first develop a sound conceptual framework that sets upper and lower bounds on representative aquifer property values. Otherwise, if aquifer hydraulic parameters are poorly constrained, the modeler runs the risk of producing a model that adequately matches historical water levels and streamflows but cannot reliably be used to make predictions of future aquifer conditions because it has unrealistic hydraulic properties. In this section, we assemble aquifer property information from both past groundwater availability models as well as our current analyses and integrate that data in a way that can be implemented in the High Plains Aquifer System groundwater availability model. The ability of the aquifer to transmit groundwater to a well can vary greatly depending on factors such as aquifer lithology, structural deformation, fracturing, and thickness of overburden. Several hydraulic properties are used to describe groundwater flow in aquifers. For this analysis, we considered hydraulic conductivity, transmissivity, and storage properties gathered from several sources. The following section reviews the sources of available data describing hydraulic properties in the Ogallala, Edwards-Trinity (High Plains), and Dockum aquifers. 4.6.1 Data Sources Hydraulic property data was largely sourced from previous TWDB groundwater availability models of the aquifers of the High Plains Aquifer System (Blandford and others, 2003; 2008; Ewing and others, 2008) as well as a model of the Northern Ogallala Aquifer in Texas (Dutton and others, 2001a; INTERA, Inc., and Dutton, 2010). We also solicited additional data that was either not incorporated in the original models, or has been collected since their publication. These data include unpublished aquifer pumping test results from various municipalities and Groundwater Conservation Districts. The lithologic (sand fraction) data is newly generated based on the geophysical log analyses described in Section 4.2. These data complement the sand fraction values from Seni (1980) that were used as secondary data to inform property distributions in previous studies. 4.6.2 Property Estimates from Calibration With previous groundwater availability modeling studies specifically covering each of the aquifers in the High Plains Aquifer System (with the exception of the Rita Blanca Aquifer, which Final Conceptual Model Report for the High Plains Aquifer System Groundwater Availability Model 4.6-2 has not been treated independently), in most cases we have full property distributions available without requiring any additional analysis. However, the \u201cfinal\u201d property distributions in those previous models have for the most part been adjusted during model calibration from initial estimates. For example, in Dutton and others (2001a), thousands of specific capacity estimates were used, overlain on maps of depositional systems, to hand-contour horizontal hydraulic conductivity. The result comprised the initial estimate. During calibration, the horizontal hydraulic conductivity was adjusted in some areas of the model to better fit head calibration targets. While the changes that were made during calibration of previous models will likely prove informative during the calibration of the current model, our initial estimates of hydraulic properties will be based on previous initial estimates of hydraulic properties, rather than the final calibrated property fields. The current model is the first to combine all of the aquifers of the High Plains Aquifer System and, thus, may behave somewhat differently than previous models, due to interaction between the aquifers, especially the Ogallala Aquifer and Dockum Group. Therefore, we felt the correct approach was to start from the property estimates made from analyzing measured data, and approach the calibration from a \u201cclean slate\u201d perspective. 4.6.3 Lithology When data are sparse, lithology can potentially be a useful and reliable proxy for hydraulic conductivity and other aquifer hydraulic properties (Folk, 1980; Carmen, 1939; Lambe and Whitman, 1969; Masch and Denny, 1966; Cade and others, 1994). The hydraulic conductivity of a deposit will generally increase with increases in the percentage of sand, in the average size of the sand grains, and in the sorting of the deposits. Since the spatial distribution of lithological information is typically better known than that of hydraulic properties, defining a relationship between sand content and hydraulic conductivity can be useful for assigning aquifer properties in a model grid. In the lithological analysis for the current model (see Section 4.2), we established a net sand thickness distribution for each of the aquifers. These distributions compare favorably with past work in the area. Seni (1980) provides a net sand distribution for the Ogallala Aquifer in Texas. Although the net sand thickness distribution developed for the current model includes areas outside of Texas, it agrees well with the Seni (1980) distribution within Texas (Figure 4.6.1). Final Conceptual Model Report for the High Plains Aquifer System Groundwater Availability Model 4.6-3 The previous Dockum Aquifer groundwater availability model (Ewing and others, 2008) provides net sand distributions for the upper and lower Dockum Group. Although the aquifer extents used in the current model differ from the earlier work, the net sand distributions agree in areas of overlap (Figures 4.6.2 and 4.6.3). The previous Edwards-Trinity (High Plains) Aquifer groundwater availability model (Blandford and others, 2008) did not provide a net sand thickness distribution that we could compare to the current model. Because the sand content is consistently high across the entire extent of the Ogallala Aquifer, we do not expect to see major variation in hydraulic conductivity due solely to changes in sand content. Indeed, a direct comparison of hydraulic conductivity to net sand thickness and to sand percent shows no measurable relationship. This is likely due to the uncertainty associated with drillers\u2019 log data. An analysis of variance between groups defined by ranges of net sand thickness or sand percent does show some statistically significant relationships that tie increasing sand content to increasing log hydraulic conductivity values (Alan Dutton, personal communication.).

An analysis of variance between groups defined by ranges of net sand thickness or sand percent does show some statistically significant relationships that tie increasing sand content to increasing log hydraulic conductivity values (Alan Dutton, personal communication.). Because the changes are small, we will not adjust the initial conceptualization of hydraulic conductivity values according to net sand thickness or sand percent distributions. Ewing and others (2008) took into account sand content when developing the hydraulic conductivity distribution for the Dockum Aquifer. Transmissivity values derived from specific capacity values were converted to hydraulic conductivity values using the net sand thickness rather than the full screen length since the clay layers were not considered to contribute a significant amount of water. The hydraulic conductivity values used in the model are these derived \u201csand\u201d hydraulic conductivity values multiplied by the sand fraction, resulting in an effective hydraulic conductivity. There was, however, no demonstrable correlation between the derived sand hydraulic conductivity and net sand thickness in either the upper and lower Dockum Group. In general, we expect higher hydraulic conductivity values in areas of higher sand content. Blandford and others (2008) did not have sufficient data to create a relationship between hydraulic conductivity and geologic setting within the Edwards-Trinity (High Plains) Aquifer. However, for the initial model distribution, they did assume that the hydraulic conductivity in the Antlers Sand and limestone portions of the aquifer was much higher (10 feet per day) than the shale portions of the aquifer (0.1 feet per day). Final Conceptual Model Report for the High Plains Aquifer System Groundwater Availability Model 4.6-4 4.6.4 Correlation of Hydraulic Conductivity to Depth Since the size and distribution of pores in the sand matrix control groundwater flow, the compaction and cementation that occurs as sediment is buried can lead to a decrease in hydraulic conductivity with depth. Previous work did not mention any measurable relationship between hydraulic conductivity and depth in either the Ogallala Aquifer or the Edwards-Trinity (High Plains) Aquifer (Blandford and others, 2003, 2008). Ewing and others (2008) did find that hydraulic conductivity did appear to decrease slightly with depth in the lower Dockum Group. In the upper Dockum Group, where data was scarcer, they found no measurable correlation between hydraulic conductivity and depth. 4.6.5 Horizontal Hydraulic Conductivity Hydraulic conductivity is a measure of the ease with which groundwater can flow through an aquifer expressed in units of length per time (for example, feet per day) or rate per area (for example, gallons per day per square foot). Higher hydraulic conductivity indicates that the aquifer will allow more water movement under the same hydraulic gradient. Field-scale hydraulic conductivity can be estimated from various types of aquifer performance tests, including slug tests (local near-well estimate), specific capacity tests (relatively near-well estimate), or multi-hour to multi-day aquifer pumping tests (integrated estimate over radius of influence, the size which depends on the duration of the test). Aquifer pumping tests can be used to estimate the transmissivity of an aquifer, which is the effective aquifer thickness multiplied by the hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer. To calculate hydraulic conductivity, the transmissivity value is divided by the effective aquifer thickness for the aquifer pumping tests. The effective aquifer thickness is often taken as the well screen length. However, since a well screen is unlikely to extend across the entire thickness of an aquifer (and so is smaller than the full aquifer thickness) this approach can produce an upper bound of hydraulic conductivity. The lower bound could be estimated by dividing the transmissivity by the full aquifer thickness. Because high quality data from multi-day aquifer pumping tests are scarce, another method of estimating hydraulic conductivity values uses specific capacity measurements, which are much more commonly available. Where transmissivity is not directly measured, it can be determined from an empirical relationship between transmissivity and specific capacity. This relationship is Final Conceptual Model Report for the High Plains Aquifer System Groundwater Availability Model 4.6-5 established by plotting transmissivity against specific capacity for wells that have both measurements recorded. Because of the many assumptions involved in this method, these values are considered more uncertain than the values determined using the previous methods. However, using specific capacity measurements can greatly improve data coverage and so is useful for providing a general idea of reasonable hydraulic conductivity values in an area with few direct measurements. The following sections provide hydraulic conductivity estimates compiled for the Ogallala and Edwards-Trinity (High Plains) aquifers and the Dockum Group. The literature review did not provide any data specific to the Rita Blanca Aquifer. Because the Rita Blanca Aquifer is hydraulically connected to the Ogallala Aquifer, its properties are often assumed to be similar to the Ogallala Aquifer. However, it likely has a lower effective hydraulic conductivity than the Ogallala Aquifer due to its lower sand percent (Figure 4.2.23). There is no evidence in the literature of regional horizontal anisotropy in the High Plains Aquifer System, so this discussion does not include horizontal anisotropy estimates. 4.6.5.1 Ogallala Aquifer Blandford and others (2003) developed the hydraulic conductivity distribution of the Southern Ogallala Aquifer using data from 7,938 well locations. Only 118 of these values are field or lab measurements of transmissivity or conductivity, while the rest are calculated using specific capacity data. The mean hydraulic conductivity value derived from specific capacity tests did not differ significantly from the mean value of reported hydraulic conductivity measurements. The spatial distribution of initial hydraulic conductivity accounts for the influence of paleochannels as mapped in Naing (2002).

The mean hydraulic conductivity value derived from specific capacity tests did not differ significantly from the mean value of reported hydraulic conductivity measurements. The spatial distribution of initial hydraulic conductivity accounts for the influence of paleochannels as mapped in Naing (2002). Blandford and others (2003) established that the hydraulic conductivity for the Southern Ogallala Aquifer ranges from 0.01 to 2,600 feet per day, with a geometric mean of approximately 6.8 feet per day. The updated Southern Ogallala and Edwards- Trinity (High Plains) aquifers model (Blandford and others, 2008) did not include any additional hydraulic conductivity data for the Ogallala Aquifer. The Northern Ogallala Aquifer model (Dutton and others, 2001a) used specific capacity data from 1,341 wells to calculate transmissivity and hydraulic conductivity in the Northern Ogallala Aquifer. They established that the geometric mean of hydraulic conductivity in the Northern Ogallala Aquifer is about 14.8 feet per day with a standard deviation of 5 to 44 feet per day. This Final Conceptual Model Report for the High Plains Aquifer System Groundwater Availability Model 4.6-6 distribution of hydraulic conductivity used in the model was adjusted by hand to match maps of depositional systems within the Ogallala Formation as given in Seni (1980). The update to the Northern Ogallala Aquifer model (INTERA, Inc., and Dutton, 2010) introduced several new data sources for hydraulic conductivity data in the Ogallala Aquifer. These include four additional aquifer pumping tests each from the City of Amarillo, Mesa Water Inc. and their consultants, and the Panhandle Groundwater Conservation District in Carson, Potter, and Roberts counties. These 12 new values largely agreed with the original hydraulic conductivity distribution produced by Dutton and others (2001a) and only required local changes to the distribution within a few square miles of each new data point. Additional data compiled for this report include aquifer pumping test data from the City of Clarendon, the Canadian River Municipal Water Authority, the City of Amarillo via the Panhandle Groundwater Conservation District, and the South Plains Underground Water Conservation District. The locations of these datasets are shown in Figure 4.6.4 and the data is given in Tables 4.6.1 through 4.6.4. Most of the values reported by the South Plains Underground Water Conservation District are significantly higher than previous estimates of hydraulic conductivity in this region. As the new values were derived from specific capacity measurements, this difference could be due simply to the uncertainty inherent in establishing a specific-capacity/transmissivity relationship. Since this area has good existing data coverage, we have reserved inclusion of this data in the updated hydraulic conductivity distribution for the Ogallala Aquifer. During calibration of the numerical model, we will examine the sensitivity to inclusion of this higher hydraulic conductivity data. The initial horizontal hydraulic conductivity distribution used in the current model is shown in Figure 4.6.5. Hydraulic conductivity values for the South Ogallala Aquifer and the portion of the Northern Ogallala Aquifer within Texas are derived from the hydraulic conductivity contours presented in Naing (2002), the same data used to develop the hydraulic conductivity distribution in Blandford and others (2003). The hydraulic conductivity values for the Northern Ogallala Aquifer outside of Texas are derived from the hydraulic conductivity contours presented in Dutton and others (2001a). The contours from Naing (2002) and Dutton and others (2001a) were converted to points and additional hydraulic conductivity point values from the City of Clarendon, the City of Amarillo, and the Canadian River Municipal Water Authority datasets Final Conceptual Model Report for the High Plains Aquifer System Groundwater Availability Model 4.6-7 were also added. These combined hydraulic conductivity point values were used to create a hydraulic conductivity distribution using the TopoToRaster interpolation function in ArcGIS. Figure 4.6.5 shows an increase in average hydraulic conductivity in the Ogallala Aquifer moving north from Texas into Oklahoma and Kansas. This trend appears in the original hydraulic conductivity estimate of Dutton and others (2001a) (see Figure 20 of that work), and was maintained in the current initial estimate. We will assess whether this trend affects model performance during calibration. Regardless of the results of that assessment, the trend is expected to have a minimal effect on the model performance as a tool for making availability assessments in Texas. 4.6.5.2 Edwards-Trinity (High Plains) Aquifer Information on the hydraulic properties of the Edwards-Trinity (High Plains) Aquifer is very limited. Blandford and others (2008) found no reported hydraulic conductivity values and were only able to locate 13 wells with specific capacity test information that were screened only in the Edwards-Trinity (High Plains) Aquifer. Using a transmissivity/specific-capacity relationship, they calculated that the hydraulic conductivity for the Edwards-Trinity (High Plains) Aquifer ranges from 0.4 to 42.8 feet per day. For the initial model distribution, they assumed that the hydraulic conductivity was 0.1 feet per day for the shale layer and 10 feet per day in both the Antlers Sand and limestone layers. Since the current model does not distinguish between the different geologic layers within the Edwards-Trinity (High Plains) Aquifer, these initial hydraulic conductivity values were weighted by the thickness of each layer to produce a composite hydraulic conductivity for the entire aquifer. The resulting initial hydraulic conductivity distribution used for the current model is shown in Figure 4.6.6. 4.6.5.3 Dockum Group Ewing and others (2008) collected three published conductivity values and 45 measured transmissivity values for the Dockum Group. Using a relationship between transmissivity and specific capacity, 19 additional hydraulic conductivity values were calculated from reported specific capacity values for the upper Dockum Group and 414 for the lower Dockum Group. As mentioned before, these derived values are effectively \u201csand\u201d hydraulic conductivities and were multiplied by sand fraction before implementation in the model. The sand hydraulic conductivities for the upper Dockum Group ranged from 0.41 to 20 feet per day with a mean Final Conceptual Model Report for the High Plains Aquifer"

The resulting initial hydraulic conductivity distribution used for the current model is shown in Figure 4.6.6. 4.6.5.3 Dockum Group Ewing and others (2008) collected three published conductivity values and 45 measured transmissivity values for the Dockum Group. Using a relationship between transmissivity and specific capacity, 19 additional hydraulic conductivity values were calculated from reported specific capacity values for the upper Dockum Group and 414 for the lower Dockum Group. As mentioned before, these derived values are effectively \u201csand\u201d hydraulic conductivities and were multiplied by sand fraction before implementation in the model. The sand hydraulic conductivities for the upper Dockum Group ranged from 0.41 to 20 feet per day with a mean Final Conceptual Model Report for the High Plains Aquifer System Groundwater Availability Model 4.6-8 value of 8.1 feet per day. In the lower Dockum Group, the range of hydraulic conductivity was 0.59 to 61 feet per day with a mean of 6.6 feet per day. Since Ewing and others (2008) did not include the section of upper Dockum Group north of the Canadian River, and we could find no specific capacity estimates in that region of the upper Dockum Group, the initial sand hydraulic conductivity was defined as the median value of the sand hydraulic conductivity in the southern portion (7 feet per day). The initial horizontal hydraulic conductivity distributions for the upper and lower Dockum Group are shown in Figures 4.6.7 and 4.6.8, respectively. These were derived by multiplying the sand hydraulic conductivity distributions provided in Ewing and others (2008) by the sand fractions developed in Section 4.2. Because Ewing and others (2008) decreased the estimates of horizontal hydraulic conductivity to about 20 percent of their initial estimate during calibration, these initial estimates for both the upper and lower Dockum Group may also be revised downward during calibration of the High Plains Aquifer System groundwater availability model. The sand hydraulic conductivity distribution for the Lower Dockum Aquifer incorporated additional aquifer pumping test data from the City of Canyon that was compiled for this report. The locations of these new data points are shown in Figure 4.6.9. Using drawdown and discharge data from these tests, we were able to calculate transmissivity values using the Cooper- Jacob straight line approximation (Cooper and Jacob, 1946). Table 4.6.5 summarizes the aquifer pumping test data and calculated hydraulic conductivity values. The calculated hydraulic conductivity values range from 7.7 to 76.5 feet per day, with an average value of 37.93 feet per day. 4.6.6 Vertical Hydraulic Conductivity At very small scales, the vertical and horizontal hydraulic conductivities may differ by very little. However, at thicknesses of several hundred feet and greater, the differences between the vertical and horizontal conductivities can be very large. In areas where the aquifer is thought to be largely structurally intact, the vertical hydraulic conductivity is limited by the hydraulic conductivity of the lower permeability units. For instance, a continuous low permeability clay layer in the middle of a sandy aquifer could greatly impede vertical flow in what would otherwise be a high permeability system. This could create a difference of several orders of magnitude between vertical and horizontal hydraulic conductivity. The presence of clays and shales will generally have the largest effect on vertical conductivity, and we will use the Final Conceptual Model Report for the High Plains Aquifer System Groundwater Availability Model 4.6-9 estimates of sand and clay fractions determined for this study (and from previous studies) to inform the distribution of vertical conductivity during calibration. Because vertical hydraulic conductivity is not measurable at the large scale typical of a regional model grid, it is usually a calibrated model parameter. Indeed, it is generally accepted that groundwater models provide the best means for estimating vertical hydraulic conductivity at a regional scale (Anderson and Woessner, 1992). The section below provides vertical hydraulic conductivity estimates produced during the calibration process of past models in the study region. 4.6.6.1 Ogallala Aquifer In the Southern Ogallala Aquifer, Blandford and others (2008) produced a model-calibrated vertical hydraulic conductivity value that is one-tenth of the horizontal hydraulic conductivity. Because Dutton and others (2001a) was a single-layer model, no vertical hydraulic conductivity value was defined for the northern portion of the Ogallala Aquifer. In general, we would expect the Ogallala Aquifer to have a higher vertical conductivity than the units that underlie it. Therefore, vertical conductivity of underlying units, including the Dockum, Edwards-Trinity (High Plains), and Rita Blanca aquifers, will likely control the overall vertical conductance between the two aquifers. 4.6.6.2 Edwards-Trinity (High Plains) Aquifer Blandford and others (2008) defined vertical hydraulic conductivity values for the different geologic layers of the Edwards-Trinity (High Plains) Aquifer. Shale layers had a model- calibrated vertical hydraulic conductivity value of 0.00001 feet per day, or 1/100th of the horizontal hydraulic conductivity. Limestone and Antlers Sand layers had a model-calibrated vertical hydraulic conductivity value that was 1/10th of the horizontal hydraulic conductivity value. 4.6.6.3 Dockum Group A model of the Palo Duro Basin in Texas (Senger and others, 1987) gives a model-calibrated vertical hydraulic conductivity value for the Dockum Group that is four orders of magnitude lower than the horizontal hydraulic conductivity. Ewing and others (2008) estimated the initial distribution of vertical hydraulic conductivity in the upper and lower Dockum Group using the harmonic mean of the sand hydraulic conductivity (5 feet per day) and clay hydraulic Final Conceptual Model Report for the High Plains Aquifer System Groundwater Availability Model 4.6-10 conductivity (5 x 10-4 feet per day), weighted according to the sand fraction. Model-calibrated vertical hydraulic conductivity values in the Dockum Aquifer ranged from 2.5 x 10-4 to 5 x 10-3 feet per day. In most of the study area, the lower Dockum Group consists of the Santa Rosa Formation overlain by the Tecovas Formation. The Tecovas Formation is composed mainly of shale and sandy shale, which limits the connection with overlying units. However, in places where the Tecovas Formation is absent, the connection with overlying units could be enhanced by direct contact with the Santa Rosa Formation which consists mainly of sandstone. Wells with Santa Rosa Formation directly overlain by the Ogallala Aquifer were identified during the process"

However, in places where the Tecovas Formation is absent, the connection with overlying units could be enhanced by direct contact with the Santa Rosa Formation which consists mainly of sandstone. Wells with Santa Rosa Formation directly overlain by the Ogallala Aquifer were identified during the process of picking geologic surfaces. Gamma, resistivity or other geophysical logs were used to pick the top of the Santa Rosa Formation and the presence or absence of the Tecovas Formation in 212 of the wells. The majority of picks were derived from gamma logs as few high-quality resistivity or other geophysical logs were available. High gamma and low resistivity responses on the geophysical logs indicate clay and were used to pick the top of the Tecovas Formation shales, where present. Low gamma and higher resistivity responses indicated sandstone and were used to pick the top of the Santa Rosa Formation. Figure 4.6.10 provides example geophysical log interpretations comparing a well where the Tecovas Formation is present and one where it is absent. Figure 4.6.11 shows the distribution of wells where the Lower Dockum Group is directly overlain by the Ogallala Aquifer and indicates whether the Tecovas Formation is present or absent at those locations. 4.6.7 Storage Properties Water is released from storage differently in confined and unconfined aquifers. In confined aquifers, the release of water is dominated by changes in pressure head. Water is released due to pressure-induced changes in the arrangement and bulk density of the aquifer matrix as well as in the density of the water. In confined aquifers, these processes are described using the term specific storage, defined as the volume of water a unit volume of aquifer releases from storage per unit decline in head (Freeze and Cherry, 1979). The dimensionless storage coefficient in confined aquifers is the product of the specific storage and the thickness of the aquifer. In unconfined aquifers, released water comes from the draining of the pore spaces of the aquifer. Specific yield is defined as the volume of water that an aquifer releases from storage per unit Final Conceptual Model Report for the High Plains Aquifer System Groundwater Availability Model 4.6-11 surface area of aquifer per unit decline in water table (Freeze and Cherry, 1979). As in confined aquifers, there is some release due to change in the aquifer matrix but this is small compared to specific yield. 4.6.7.1 Ogallala Aquifer Since the Ogallala Aquifer is generally unconfined, specific yield is the most important storage property to consider. In Blandford and others (2003), specific yield values for the Southern Ogallala Aquifer ranged from 15 to 22 percent with an average of 16 percent. Blandford and others (2008) cite a specific yield value of 15 percent, likely since this is a commonly assumed value for the Ogallala Aquifer (Mullican and others, 1997; Luckey and others, 1986). In the Northern Ogallala Aquifer, Dutton and others (2001a) established a specific yield distribution by merging Texas values from Knowles and others (1984) with non-Texas values from Luckey and Becker (1999). The Luckey and Becker (1999) distribution was based on Gutentag and others (1984). The Knowles and others (1984) estimates were based on a large-scale drilling program with laboratory analysis of the resulting cores. Specific yield values in the final Dutton and others (2001a) coverage ranged from 0.04 to 0.28. Figure 4.6.12a shows the combined specific yield coverages from Blandford and others (2003) in the Southern Ogallala Aquifer and Dutton and others (2001a) in the Northern Ogallala Aquifer. McGuire and others (2012) also created a specific yield distribution for the entire Ogallala Aquifer based on data from Gutentag and others (1984) and Cederstrand and Becker (1998), which were based on analyses of drillers\u2019 logs. Specific yield values from McGuire and others (2012) ranged from 0.025 to 0.28 for the Ogallala Aquifer (Figure 4.6.12b). Since specific yield is correlated to porosity, estimates of porosity from geophysical logs can be used to estimate specific yield. However, porosity estimates require a neutron porosity log, and, as there were only a handful of these logs available in the log database, there was insufficient data to make revised specific yield estimates. Rather, the current study relies on previous studies for estimates of specific yield. 4.6.7.2 Edwards-Trinity (High Plains) Aquifer The Edwards-Trinity (High Plains) Aquifer has both unconfined (a small area) and confined portions. There are no recorded storativity values available for any Edwards-Trinity (High Plains) Aquifer wells. Instead, Blandford and others (2008) assumed a constant specific storage Final Conceptual Model Report for the High Plains Aquifer System Groundwater Availability Model 4.6-12 value of 3 x 10-6 per foot. Where the aquifer is unconfined, they assumed the specific yield of the Antlers Sand portion of the aquifer ranges from about 10 to 20 percent. In the producing Edwards and Comanche Peak limestone intervals, the specific yield was assumed to be less than 10 percent, since drainage is largely due to secondary porosity from fractures and solution channels, rather than primary porosity. The initial specific yield values were thus set at 0.05 for limestone and 0.15 for Antlers Sand. Shale was assumed to be 0.1. The literature value for specific yield in shale and limestone is generally lower, ranging from 0.005 to 0.05 (Sterrett, 2007). Sensitivity to specific yield will be tested during calibration and the specific yield values will be adjusted, if necessary. 4.6.7.3 Dockum Group The Dockum Aquifer also has both unconfined and confined portions. For the confined portion, a literature review reported in Ewing and others (2008) defined a storativity range from 5 x 10-5 to 2 x 10-3 with a geometric mean of 1.6 x 10-4. Due to the scarcity of data, however, specific storage in the Ewing and"

For the confined portion, a literature review reported in Ewing and others (2008) defined a storativity range from 5 x 10-5 to 2 x 10-3 with a geometric mean of 1.6 x 10-4. Due to the scarcity of data, however, specific storage in the Ewing and others (2008) model was calculated by combining the specific storage for sand (3 x 10-6) and the specific storage for clay (7.5 x 10-6), weighted according to the sand fraction. The distribution of specific storage used for the upper and lower Dockum Group is shown in Figures 4.6.13 and 4.6.14, respectively. There are no reported estimates of specific yield for the Dockum Aquifer. Instead, Ewing and others (2008) assume a value of 0.15 for the unconfined portions of the aquifer. This value is based on combining reasonable ranges for material similar to the sediments in the study area (0.03 to 0.28) given by Domenico and Schwartz (1998) and for unconfined aquifers (0.1 to 0.3) given by Lohman (1972). Since the literature review did not provide any data specific to storage properties in the Rita Blanca Aquifer, specific yield values in the outcrop and specific storage values in the subcrop were estimated using the same methodology as for the Dockum Aquifer.

Final Conceptual Model Report for the High Plains Aquifer System Groundwater Availability Model 4.7-1 4.7 Aquifer Discharge Discharge refers to water moving out of an aquifer by either natural or anthropogenic processes. Natural processes include evapotranspiration, cross-formational flow, and discharge to streams, springs, and other surface water bodies. The most important anthropogenic discharge mechanism is groundwater pumping. 4.7.1 Natural Aquifer Discharge Under pre-development conditions, without any pumping, aquifer recharge and discharge are balanced. Natural aquifer discharge occurs as base flow to streams, springs and seeps, groundwater evapotranspiration, and cross-formational flow. Recharge that discharges through surficial features is sometimes termed \u201crejected recharge\u201d. This discharging water has the potential to be captured by pumping, if the water table is lowered to the point where gradients are affected, and natural discharge is decreased. The plethora of springs and seeps from the Ogallala Aquifer observed by Gould (1906, 1907) in stream valleys is an example of recharge rejected by the aquifer prior to its development. The decrease in flow to springs in the Ogallala Aquifer post-development is an example of capture of \u201crejected recharge\u201d. Natural aquifer discharge through stream base flow is discussed in Sections 4.5.1. Discharge through springs is discussed in Section 4.5.2. Cross-formational flow is discussed in Section 4.3.6. Refer to these sections for additional information on these discharge mechanisms. The remaining natural discharge mechanism, groundwater evapotranspiration, is the focus of this section. Evapotranspiration is the combined process of soil water evaporation near the land surface and the uptake in the root zone and subsequent transpiration of water by vegetation. For the purposes of groundwater modeling, two types of evapotranspiration are distinguished: vadose zone evapotranspiration and groundwater evapotranspiration. Evapotranspiration in the vadose zone captures infiltrating water before it reaches the water table. Groundwater evapotranspiration is plant uptake or surface evaporation of groundwater. Here, the focus is groundwater evapotranspiration, since it is the type implemented in the groundwater model. Vadose zone evapotranspiration is accounted for in the recharge estimate as discussed in Section 4.4. Final Conceptual Model Report for the High Plains Aquifer System Groundwater Availability Model 4.7-2 Groundwater evapotranspiration occurs primarily in riparian buffer strips adjacent to streams (Scanlon and others, 2005a). Since riparian zones are not specifically mapped in Texas, two methods can be used to define the location of groundwater evapotranspiration. Either a fixed buffer around streams can be defined as riparian areas, or topographically lower areas can be assumed to be likely regions of groundwater evapotranspiration. In general, the goal is to limit the potential for groundwater evapotranspiration to regions where the water table is near ground surface. Both approaches likely produce similar results, although some combination may be necessary if the stream coverage does not have adequate resolution to define all of the discharge areas. The potential for groundwater evapotranspiration is expected near rivers and streams crossing the Ogallala Aquifer and the outcrops of the Rita Blanca and Dockum aquifers. Scanlon and others (2005a) summarize the conceptual approach to estimating groundwater evapotranspiration. In general, if water tables are very near the surface, evapotranspiration will be close to the potential evapotranspiration, assuming there is some type of vegetative cover. Potential evapotranspiration and reference evapotranspiration are terms often used interchangeably. Reference evapotranspiration is defined as the evapotranspiration rate from a reference vegetation, often a short grass, that has unlimited available water. Potential evapotranspiration should not be confused with \u201cpan evaporation\u201d, which is the rate of water evaporation from an open pan. Potential evapotranspiration can be related to pan evaporation by the use of pan coefficients; however, since potential evaporation can be estimated with basic climate data, pan evaporation is not used in the calculation of potential evapotranspiration. When the water table is below ground surface but still in the main vegetation root zone, evapotranspiration will occur at the unhindered vegetative evapotranspiration rate, ETVmax. This can be estimated by (Scanlon and others, 2005a): ETVmax = PET * Kc (4.7.1) where Kc is the vegetation coefficient PET is the potential evapotranspiration Thus, to parameterize groundwater evapotranspiration, three parameters must be estimated: potential evapotranspiration, vegetation coefficient, and rooting depth. Rooting depth and Final Conceptual Model Report for the High Plains Aquifer System Groundwater Availability Model 4.7-3 vegetation coefficient are specific to the type of vegetation, so a necessary prerequisite is some knowledge of the types of vegetation in the riparian areas in the model region. The following paragraphs discuss potential evaporation in the study area, how the types of vegetation in the model region were estimated, and the corresponding vegetation coefficients and rooting depths. Borrelli and others (1998) provide an estimate of long-term potential evapotranspiration in Texas, based on the Penman-Monteith method, as reproduced in Figure 4.7.1 for the study area. This figure shows that the long-term average potential evapotranspiration ranges from about 59 to 78 inches per year, increasing from northeast to southwest. Although evapotranspiration varies considerably with seasons, it does not vary significantly year to year (annual average basis). For this reason, the assumption is made that potential evapotranspiration is constant throughout a transient simulation, where annual stress periods are used. The National Land Cover Database 2006 (Fry and others, 2011) provides detailed land use data for the entire conterminous United States. Figure 4.7.2 shows land use coverage for the study area. Unfortunately, this dataset does not specifically identify riparian vegetation or riparian zones. To determine whether different types of vegetation are identified in areas near rivers, a coverage of the major rivers and streams in the area including a one-mile riparian buffer was created and intersected with the vegetation coverage. The distribution of vegetation types for this subset was calculated and compared to the vegetation distribution in the entire model region, as shown in Figure 4.7.3."

The distribution of vegetation types for this subset was calculated and compared to the vegetation distribution in the entire model region, as shown in Figure 4.7.3. With the exception of cultivated crops, the relative frequency of each vegetation type is very similar, indicating that either markedly atypical vegetation does not naturally occur near streams, or the vegetation coverage does not contain sufficient resolution to discriminate the riparian areas. Lacking higher resolution information, the potential for discharge through groundwater evapotranspiration was assumed to occur within riparian areas defined by a buffer around streams. Scanlon and others (2005a) provides a database of estimates of vegetation coefficient and rooting depths for many types of vegetation. Table 4.7.1 shows estimates for several vegetation types in the Amarillo region according to Scanlon and others (2005a). Using the Simplified-Surface-Energy-Balance (SSEB) Model, Houston and others (2013) calculated average annual actual evapotranspiration during the period 2000 to 2009 for the Ogallala Aquifer. These values, shown in Figure 4.7.4, range from 5 to 48 inches per year, with Final Conceptual Model Report for the High Plains Aquifer System Groundwater Availability Model 4.7-4 the highest values clustered around rivers and streams. A comparison of the calculated groundwater evapotranspiration for the model to the actual evaporation estimated by Houston and others (2013) could provide a consistency check of the model values, as they should not be greater than actual evapotranspiration. 4.7.2 Aquifer Discharge through Pumping Under pre-development conditions, a long-term dynamic equilibrium exists where aquifer recharge is balanced by aquifer discharge. This hydraulic condition is generally referred to as a steady-state system. Human activities alter the dynamic equilibrium of the pre-development flow system through groundwater pumping withdrawals, changes in recharge through development and irrigation return flow, and changes in vegetation. From the groundwater perspective, groundwater withdrawals due to pumping almost always have the greatest impact on aquifer hydraulics. Groundwater removed by pumping is supplied through reduced natural groundwater discharge, decreased groundwater storage, and sometimes increased recharge. The observable impact resulting from pumping is declines in water levels. Throughout much of the High Plains Aquifer System, groundwater withdrawals exceed the amount of recharge, and water levels have declined fairly consistently through time. Water-level declines in excess of 200 feet have occurred in the Ogallala Aquifer in several areas over the last 50 to 60 years (see Section 4.3). However, there are also areas where water levels have risen over the last few years (see Section 4.3). For an aquifer system that has experienced significant groundwater loss through pumping and associated changes in water levels, accurate definition of pumping is an important parameter required for development of a reliable model. Data from various sources was integrated in estimating pumping. These data included: \uf0b7 Water use surveys provided by the TWDB for the periods 1980 to 2008 (TWDB, 2013b) and 2000 to 2012 (TWDB, 2013c). \uf0b7 TWDB irrigation survey data for the years 1958, 1964, 1969, 1974, 1979, 1984, and 1989 (TWDB, 1991). \uf0b7 Agricultural water demands for the years 1952 to 1956, 1982 to 1984, 1987, 1992 to 1994, and 1997 estimated by Amosson and others (2003). Final Conceptual Model Report for the High Plains Aquifer System Groundwater Availability Model 4.7-5 \uf0b7 Metered pumping data for the years 2008 to 2012 from the North Plains Groundwater Conservation District (Hallmark, 2013). \uf0b7 Historical pumping estimates for the years 1950 to 2008 from the Northern Ogallala Aquifer groundwater availability model Update to Support the 2011 [Region A] Water Plan (INTERA, Inc. and Dutton, 2010). \uf0b7 Historical pumping estimates for the years 1940 to 2000 from the Southern Ogallala Aquifer groundwater availability model (Blandford and others, 2003). \uf0b7 Historical pumping estimates for the years 1930 to 2000 from the Edwards-Trinity (High Plains) Aquifer groundwater availability model (Blandford and others, 2008). \uf0b7 Historical pumping estimates for the years 1950 to 1997 from the Dockum Aquifer groundwater availability model (Ewing and others, 2008). Aquifers considered for pumping are: the Ogallala Aquifer, the Dockum Aquifer, the Edwards- Trinity (High Plains) Aquifer, and the Rita Blanca Aquifer. Pumping for each of these aquifers is discussed in subsequent sections. Pumping is considered for the following seven categories: irrigation, municipal, manufacturing, mining, power, livestock, and rural domestic. Because the Edwards-Trinity (Plateau) and Pecos Valley aquifers will not be explicitly modeled in the High Plains Aquifer System groundwater availability model (they will be treated as boundary conditions), pumping in those aquifers is not estimated as part of this study. 4.7.2.1 Northern Ogallala Aquifer Pumping Most groundwater discharge from the Northern Ogallala Aquifer is through pumping, of which irrigation is the dominant type of water use. Pumping estimates for the Northern Ogallala Aquifer were based on three data sources: the most updated Northern Ogallala Aquifer groundwater availability model (INTERA, Inc. and Dutton, 2010), metered data obtained from the North Plains Groundwater Conservation District (Hallmark, 2013), and water use survey data provided by the TWDB for the period 2000 to 2012 (TWDB, 2013c). The updated Northern Ogallala Aquifer groundwater availability model (INTERA, Inc. and Dutton, 2010) incorporates historical pumping from 1950 to 2008.

The 2004 groundwater availability model reconstructed historical groundwater withdrawals in the period 1950 to 1998 from the following sources. o Pumping for municipal, industrial, irrigation, livestock, mining, and power uses during 1958, 1964, 1969, and 1974 was taken from worksheets compiled by Knowles and others (1984). o Pumping for 1980 to 1996 was tallied from a groundwater-summary database compiled by the TWDB (Dutton and Reedy, 2000). o Decadal estimates of irrigation withdrawal for 1950 to 1997 were made by the Texas Agricultural Experiment Station on the basis of rainfall and irrigation efficiencies (Dutton and Reedy, 2000). o Pumping estimates were modified as appropriate to reflect pumping only from the Ogallala Aquifer. \uf0b7 The updated model by INTERA, Inc. and Dutton (2010) used the same estimates as the 2004 groundwater availability model for historical irrigation, livestock, and rural domestic pumping for all Texas counties for the period 1950 to 1997. \uf0b7 The updated model extended historical irrigation pumping for all Texas counties from 1998 through 2008. The new estimates were based on metered data received from the North Plains and Panhandle Groundwater Conservation Districts along with irrigation demand estimates developed by Freese and Nichols. \uf0b7 The updated model extended historical livestock and rural domestic pumping for all Texas counties from 1998 through 2008 using demand estimates developed by Freese and Nichols. \uf0b7 INTERA, Inc. and Dutton (2010) updated municipal, manufacturing, mining, and power pumping for all Texas counties using information provided by the TWDB, which enumerated annual water use by individual large and small surveyed entities. Final Conceptual Model Report for the High Plains Aquifer System Groundwater Availability Model 4.7-7 Information from the TWDB was supplemented or replaced as appropriate where more accurate data were available. \uf0b7 Historical pumping in all non-Texas counties for all water use categories was kept the same as the 2004 groundwater availability model, which derived these data from the digital files of Luckey and Becker (1999). After reviewing the pumping estimates from the updated Northern Ogallala Aquifer groundwater availability model (INTERA, Inc. and Dutton, 2010), it was decided that those estimates provided the most reliable source of information for regional pumping for the aquifer. Thus, all historical pumping estimates for the period between 1950 and 2008 for the Northern Ogallala Aquifer in the High Plains Aquifer System groundwater availability model were kept consistent with the updated Northern Ogallala Aquifer groundwater availability model (INTERA, Inc. and Dutton, 2010). Pumping was assumed to be zero in 1930. Pumping for the years between 1930 and 1950 was linearly interpolated between zero in 1930 and the value in the updated Northern Ogallala Aquifer groundwater availability model in 1950. For the period from 2009 to 2012, two pumping data sources were available: TWDB water use survey data for the years 2000 through 2011 (2012 pumping was missing or incomplete for many counties in the TWDB water use survey data) and irrigation pumping volumes provided by the North Plains Groundwater Conservation District from their metering program for the years 2006 through 2012. For counties completely within the North Plains Groundwater Conservation District boundary, the metered data was fairly consistent with the TWDB water use survey data between 2006 and 2011. These counties include Hansford, Lipscomb, Ochiltree, and Sherman. A good match between the metered data and the water use survey data for Hartley County, which is only partially within the North Plains Groundwater Conservation District, was also found. Figures 4.7.5 shows the model historical pumping from the updated Northern Ogallala Aquifer groundwater availability model compared to the TWDB water use survey data and the metered pumping volumes from the North Plains Groundwater Conservation District for Hansford County, which lies completely within the District. Figure 4.7.6 shows the same comparison for Dallam County, which is partially within the North Plains Groundwater Conservation District boundary. Final Conceptual Model Report for the High Plains Aquifer System Groundwater Availability Model 4.7-8 Based on these comparisons, the North Plains Groundwater Conservation District metered data were used to extend irrigation pumping from 2009 to 2012 for all counties lying completely within the District boundary. Non-irrigation pumping for these counties was extended using the TWDB water use survey data from 2009 to 2011. For counties partially located within the North Plains Groundwater Conservation District, the TWDB water use survey data were used to extend pumping from 2009 to 2011 for all water use categories, including irrigation. Due to missing data in 2012 in the TWDB water use survey, 2012 pumping levels were kept the same as 2011 levels when using the TWDB water use survey data. A United States Geological Survey study with remote-sensing based water-balance estimates (Stanton and others (2011) was evaluated for additional pumping information in the study area.

This second estimate compares favorably with the 2000 to 2009 average pumping estimated from the TWDB water use survey (4.7 million acre-feet). It is promising that one of the models did roughly agree with the TWDB water use survey, which is used as the \"gold standard\" for estimating pumping in the current report. However, in general, the Stanton and others (2011) study does not otherwise provide additional helpful information for checking and/or correcting the current study's pumping estimates. For non-Texas (New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Kansas) counties, pumping from 1950 through 2008 was taken from the updated Northern Ogallala Aquifer groundwater availability model. Pumping was linearly extended back to 1930 (assuming zero pumping for that year) and kept constant at 2008 levels for the period 2009 through 2012. Final Conceptual Model Report for the High Plains Aquifer System Groundwater Availability Model 4.7-9 Figure 4.7.7 shows total pumping by category for the Texas portion of the Northern Ogallala Aquifer. Figure 4.7.8 shows total pumping for the non-Texas portion of the Northern Ogallala Aquifer. 4.7.2.2 Southern Ogallala Aquifer Pumping Similar to the Northern Ogallala Aquifer, the Southern Ogallala Aquifer is also dominated by irrigation pumping, which accounts for approximately 95 percent or more of total groundwater withdrawal (Blandford and others, 2003). This part of the Ogallala Aquifer was originally modeled by Blandford and others (2003) as part of the Southern Ogallala Aquifer groundwater availability model and later updated in the Edwards-Trinity (High Plains) Aquifer groundwater availability model (Blandford and others 2008). Historical pumping for the original model (Blandford and others, 2003) extended from 1940 through 2000. Irrigation pumping estimates for the original Southern Ogallala Aquifer groundwater availability model were based on a study conducted by Amosson and others (2003). That study estimated pumping for irrigated agriculture for the years 1982, 1983, 1984, 1987, 1992, 1993, 1994, and 1997 based on a water balance approach. Their procedure involved using weather data, crop types, acreages, irrigation technologies, and other relevant data from the region. Observed water levels were used to validate the crop demand estimates where available. Pre-1980 irrigation pumping estimates were based on irrigation surveys provided by the TWDB for both Southern Ogallala Aquifer groundwater availability models. Blandford and others (2003) assumed that irrigation return flows contributed a significant amount of recharge to the aquifer. They accounted for this by reducing the amount of pumping assigned in their model. The return flows estimated by Blandford and others (2003) are given in Table 4.7.2. Using these estimates, they reduced pumping for the different decadal periods by a proportionate amount. As discussed in Section 4.4, new analyses of recharge and irrigation return flow in the Ogallala Aquifer indicate that irrigation return flow has not occurred in many of the counties where the \"high percentage return flow\" assumption was made (for example, Hale, Floyd, Parmer, and Castro counties). Additionally, many high producing counties with evidence of return flow (for example, Lamb, and Lubbock counties), show that return flow did not reach the water table until the 1990s, too late to have made any difference during the time of proposed peak production. Therefore, the pumping estimates presented here do not account for Final Conceptual Model Report for the High Plains Aquifer System Groundwater Availability Model 4.7-10 return flow. In Section 4.7.2.7, a discussion is provided as to whether these high demands, which required the percentage adjustment by Blandford and others (2008), are plausible given the estimated change in storage during that time period. Blandford and others (2003) provide pumping estimates for the original Southern Ogallala Aquifer groundwater availability model, without accounting for return flows, in Appendix C of their report. Blandford and others (2008) updated these pumping estimates by modifying irrigation pumping for individual districts to assist in model calibration. Those modifications are described in Appendix D of their report. The post-calibration pumping estimates from Blandford and others (2008) were not considered applicable to the current modeling study, especially as return flows are handled differently in this study. Therefore, the pre-calibration pumping estimates without the effect of return flows as given in Appendix C of Blandford and others (2003), were used as the basis for historical pumping in the Southern Ogallala Aquifer for the current model. That pumping is consistent with the Amosson and others (2003) irrigation demands for 1982, 1983, 1984, 1987, 1992, 1993, 1994, and 1997 and the irrigation survey data provided by the TWDB (1991) for groundwater withdrawals for the years 1958, 1964, 1969, 1974, and 1979. Amosson and others (2003) also estimated irrigation demands for the years 1952 through 1956 (consistent with the drought of record for much of the southern High Plains). Those estimates were based on climatic conditions in the 1950s but assumed the same crop acreage and irrigation practices as in 1997. Use of these 1950s estimates from Amosson and others (2003) was investigated when evaluating approaches to updating historical irrigation pumping for the Southern Ogallala Aquifer. The 1950s estimates from Amosson and others (2003) provide useful information on potential trends in irrigation water use in the 1950s. However, direct use of those data was not considered because they were not developed using crop acreages and irrigation practices applicable to the 1950s. During the numerical modeling phase, these estimates may be used to guide calibration efforts. For the current model of the High Plains Aquifer System, 1958 pumping from Blandford and others (2003) was interpolated back to zero pumping in 1930. The year 1958 was chosen as this was the earliest year with reliable irrigation pumping estimate from the irrigation survey (TWDB, 1991). For"

However, direct use of those data was not considered because they were not developed using crop acreages and irrigation practices applicable to the 1950s. During the numerical modeling phase, these estimates may be used to guide calibration efforts. For the current model of the High Plains Aquifer System, 1958 pumping from Blandford and others (2003) was interpolated back to zero pumping in 1930. The year 1958 was chosen as this was the earliest year with reliable irrigation pumping estimate from the irrigation survey (TWDB, 1991). For most counties, the interpolation followed the trend in irrigated acreage for Final Conceptual Model Report for the High Plains Aquifer System Groundwater Availability Model 4.7-11 the southern High Plains provided by Luckey and others (1986) and shown in Table 4.7.3. The periods 1930 through 1939, 1940 through 1944, 1945 through 1949, 1950 through 1954, and 1954 through 1959 were on average 0, 8, 33, 73, and 100 percent, respectively, of the 1958 estimated pumping number. For several counties, records of early (pre-1940) irrigation districts suggest the possibility that pumping may have been significant in these counties in early years. These included Bailey, Briscoe, Castro, Crosby, Deaf Smith, Floyd, Hale, Hockley, Lamb, Lubbock, Parmer, and Swisher counties. For these counties, pumping was interpolated linearly between 1930 and 1958. For the intermediate years not included in the Amosson and others (2003) data, Blandford and others (2003) estimated irrigation pumping through linear interpolation. The TWDB water use survey data provide information on irrigation pumping trends in these intermediate years as well as beyond 1997. Therefore, the Amosson and others (2003) data were merged with the TWDB irrigation pumping trends using a scaling methodology to interpolate between the values for years given in Amosson and others (2003). This was done as follows: \uf0b7 For all years with an Amosson and others (2003) estimate, pumping was maintained at the value given by Amosson and others (2003). \uf0b7 For the intermediate years, the ratio between the average of Amosson and others (2003) pumping estimates for the beginning and ending of the period and the average TWDB water use survey pumping for the period was taken. For example, for the period between 1987 and 1992 the ratio (r) was calculated as: \u074e\u0d4c \u0d6b\u0bca\u0cb2\u0cd8\u0cda\u0cde\u0cde\u0cda\u0cd9,\u0c2d\u0c35\u0c34\u0c33\u0b3e\u0bca\u0cb2\u0cd8\u0cda\u0cde\u0cde\u0cda\u0cd9,\u0c2d\u0c35\u0c35\u0c2e\u0d6f/\u0b36 \u1240\u2211 \u0bca\u0cc5\u0cc8\u0cb5\u0cb3,\u0ce4 \u0ce4\u0c38\u0c2d\u0c35\u0c35\u0c2e \u0ce4\u0c38\u0c2d\u0c35\u0c34\u0c33 \u1241/\u0b39 (4.7.2) where QAmosson, 1987 and QAmosson, 1992 are the Amosson and others (2003) estimates for the years 1987 and 1992, and QTWDB, y is the TWDB estimates for years from 1987 to 1992. \uf0b7 The pumping estimates for the intermediate years were calculated as the product of the TWDB pumping for the years and the calculated ratio. \uf0b7 For years beyond 1997, the ratio was kept the same as for the 1994 to 1997 period. \uf0b7 The TWDB values used in the calculation for the years 1980 through 1999 are based on the TWDB water use survey data from 1980 to 2008 (TWDB, 2013b) and the values used Final Conceptual Model Report for the High Plains Aquifer System Groundwater Availability Model 4.7-12 for the years 2000 to 2011 are based on the TWDB water use survey data from 2000 to 2012 (TWDB, 2013c). Due to incomplete data for 2012 in the TWDB water use survey, pumping for 2012 was kept at the same level as that for 2011. The final pumping estimates developed for the High Plains Aquifer System groundwater availability model are consistent with the pre-calibrated irrigation pumping estimates from the Southern Ogallala Aquifer groundwater availability model (Blandford and others, 2003) without accounting for return flows for the period between 1958 to 1984, as well as the years 1987, 1992, 1993, 1994, and 1997. Pre-1958 pumping either follows trends based on Luckey and others (1986) or were interpolated linearly between 1930 and 1958. For intermediate years between the Amosson and others (2003) estimates, as well as for the period from 1997 to 2012, the pumping estimates follow the trends in the TWDB water use survey data but the magnitudes are scaled to be commensurate with the Amosson and others (2003) estimates for the period. Figures 4.7.9 through 4.7.18 show the developed irrigation pumping estimates for select counties along with the different data sources used to develop the estimates (that is, pre-calibrated/no return flow irrigation pumping from the original Southern Ogallala Aquifer groundwater availability model (Blandford and others, 2003), irrigation survey data (TWDB, 1991), Amosson and others (2003) estimates, and the TWDB water use survey data). Counties such as Deaf Smith, Hale, Lubbock, Parmer, and Swisher counties are among those with early irrigation districts and, thus, follow a linear trend between 1930 and 1958. Counties such as Gaines, Midland, Randall, Terry, and Yoakum counties did not have early irrigation districts and, thus, follow the trend from Luckey and others (1986), which rises slowly beginning in 1930 and ramps up rapidly in the 1950s. Current estimates are consistent with the irrigation survey (TWDB, 1991) between 1958 and 1979 and with the pre-calibrated pumping estimates for the years 1958 through 1984 from Blandford and others (2003). The only exception is for Yoakum and Terry counties where Blandford and others (2003) reduced pre-1980 pumping. For the sake of consistency, the estimates for this model maintain consistency with the estimates in the TWDB irrigation survey (TWDB, 1991) for these years. All estimates are consistent with the Amosson and others (2003) estimates for the years 1982, 1983, 1984, 1987, 1992, 1993, 1994, and 1997. Trends in the intermediate years (1985, 1986, 1988, 1989, 1990, 1991, 1995, 1996, Final Conceptual Model Report for the High Plains Aquifer System Groundwater Availability Model 4.7-13 1998, and beyond) are consistent with the TWDB water use surveys data, while maintaining the same magnitude as the Amosson and others (2003) estimates. For most counties, the 1950s estimates from Amosson and others (2003) (which were not used directly in the estimation process) are fairly consistent with the interpolated levels in the 1950s (see Figures 4.7.9 through 4.7.18).

Trends in the intermediate years (1985, 1986, 1988, 1989, 1990, 1991, 1995, 1996, Final Conceptual Model Report for the High Plains Aquifer System Groundwater Availability Model 4.7-13 1998, and beyond) are consistent with the TWDB water use surveys data, while maintaining the same magnitude as the Amosson and others (2003) estimates. For most counties, the 1950s estimates from Amosson and others (2003) (which were not used directly in the estimation process) are fairly consistent with the interpolated levels in the 1950s (see Figures 4.7.9 through 4.7.18). Gaines, Parmer, Terry, and Yoakum counties are some of the counties where developed pumping estimates are higher or lower that the 1950 Amosson and others (2003) estimates. Non-irrigation pumping in both the original and updated Southern Ogallala Aquifer groundwater availability models was based on TWDB water use surveys data for respective non-irrigation categories. Consistent with this approach, the current non-irrigation pumping estimates were taken from the water use survey data for the years 1980 to 2011. Pre-1980 non-irrigation pumping was taken from the previous Southern Ogallala Aquifer groundwater availability models (Blandford and others, 2003, 2008). Due to incomplete data for the year 2012 in the TWDB water use survey data, pumping in 2012 was assumed to be the same as in 2011. Pumping for all New Mexico counties in the Southern Ogallala Aquifer (Curry, Lea, Quay, and Roosevelt counties) was taken from the previous groundwater availability models without any modifications. Pumping was linearly extracted back to 1930 (assuming zero for that year) and kept constant at 1997 levels for the period 1998 through 2012. Figure 4.7.19 shows the estimated pumping by category developed for the Southern Ogallala Aquifer for the Texas portion of the aquifer. Figure 4.7.20 shows the total pumping for the Southern Ogallala Aquifer outside of Texas. 4.7.2.3 Dockum Group Pumping Historical pumping estimates for the years 1950 through 1997 are available from the Dockum Aquifer groundwater availability model (Ewing and others, 2008). Ewing and others (2008) used estimates provided by the TWDB in a pumpage geodatabase for historical pumping in all Texas counties from 1980 through 1997. The geodatabase included estimates for municipal, manufacturing, power generation, mining, livestock, and irrigation. Rural domestic pumping, which consists primarily of unreported domestic water use, was estimated based on population density data provided by the TWDB. Ewing and others (2008) estimated pre-1980 pumping by interpolating 1980 pumping to 1950 assuming a regional trend based on total irrigation water use Final Conceptual Model Report for the High Plains Aquifer System Groundwater Availability Model 4.7-14 reported in the TWDB irrigation surveys for the years 1958, 1964, 1969, 1974, and 1979 (TWDB, 1981). Ewing and others (2008) based pumping in New Mexico counties on countywide pumping estimates from the New Mexico Office of the State Engineer (Sorensen, 1977, 1982; Wilson, 1992; Wilson and Lucero, 1997; Wilson and others, 2003) and the United States Geological Survey (United States Geological Survey, 2007), which covered the period from 1975 through 2000 in 5 year increments. Historical pumping estimates for Dockum Group are also available from the water use surveys obtained from the TWDB for the period 1980 to 2008 and 2000 to 2012 (TWDB, 2013b,c). Pumping from the Dockum Aquifer groundwater availability model (Ewing and others, 2008) and the TWDB water use surveys were combined in estimating pumping for the current model. Pumping from the Dockum Aquifer groundwater availability model was taken for the years 1980 to 1997. Consistent with the Dockum Aquifer groundwater availability model, pre-1980 pumping was interpolated back to 1930 using ratios based on regional irrigation pumping trends from the TWDB irrigation survey for the years 1958, 1958, 1964, 1969, 1974, and 1979 (TWDB, 1981). Since the TWDB irrigation estimates only go back to 1958, 1930 pumping was assumed to be 10 percent of 1958 levels. Table 4.7.4 shows the percentage of 1980 pumping used for pre- 1980 estimates. Intermediate years not shown in the table were interpolated linearly. Post-1997 pumping for all categories was estimated based on the 2000 to 2012 TWDB water use survey (TWDB, 2013c). Pumping for 1998 and 1999 was kept constant at 1997 levels. In some instances, the Dockum Aquifer groundwater availability model has pumping for counties or categories that were not found in the latest TWDB water use survey data. In such instances, 1997 levels from Ewing and others (2008) were kept constant until 2012. Figure 4.7.21 shows the estimated pumping by category developed for the Dockum Group for the Texas portion of the aquifer. Figure 4.7.22 shows the total pumping for the Dockum Group in New Mexico. 4.7.2.4 Edwards-Trinity (High Plains) Aquifer Pumping Blandford and others (2008) estimated historical pumping in the Edwards-Trinity (High Plains) Aquifer based on the TWDB pumpage geodatabase. The TWDB water use surveys (TWDB, Final Conceptual Model Report for the High Plains Aquifer System Groundwater Availability Model 4.7-15 2013b,c) contain more updated estimates for pumping. Therefore, the pumping estimates from Blandford and others (2008) were updated using the TWDB water use survey data (TWDB, 2013b,c). Pumping for 1930 to 1980 was taken directly from the Edwards-Trinity (High Plains) Aquifer groundwater availability model. Since only total pumping is available from that groundwater availability model, the pumping was split between categories (irrigation and livestock were the only categories mentioned by Blandford and others, 2008) using the 1980 ratios from the TWDB water use survey data. Pumping for 1980 to 1999 was taken from the TWDB water use survey data for the years 1980 to 2008 (TWDB, 2013b). Pumping for the years 2000 to 2012 was taken from the TWDB water use survey data for the years 2000 to 2012 (TWDB, 2013c). The original groundwater availability model has only irrigation and livestock pumping, however, the water use surveys report pumping for several other categories (for example, municipal, mining, and manufacturing). Pumping in Gaines and Dawson counties was considered as a special case by Blandford and others (2008). In these counties, the Cretaceous-age shale separating the Ogallala Aquifer from the Edwards-Trinity"

Figure 4.7.22 shows the total pumping for the Dockum Group in New Mexico. 4.7.2.4 Edwards-Trinity (High Plains) Aquifer Pumping Blandford and others (2008) estimated historical pumping in the Edwards-Trinity (High Plains) Aquifer based on the TWDB pumpage geodatabase. The TWDB water use surveys (TWDB, Final Conceptual Model Report for the High Plains Aquifer System Groundwater Availability Model 4.7-15 2013b,c) contain more updated estimates for pumping. Therefore, the pumping estimates from Blandford and others (2008) were updated using the TWDB water use survey data (TWDB, 2013b,c). Pumping for 1930 to 1980 was taken directly from the Edwards-Trinity (High Plains) Aquifer groundwater availability model. Since only total pumping is available from that groundwater availability model, the pumping was split between categories (irrigation and livestock were the only categories mentioned by Blandford and others, 2008) using the 1980 ratios from the TWDB water use survey data. Pumping for 1980 to 1999 was taken from the TWDB water use survey data for the years 1980 to 2008 (TWDB, 2013b). Pumping for the years 2000 to 2012 was taken from the TWDB water use survey data for the years 2000 to 2012 (TWDB, 2013c). The original groundwater availability model has only irrigation and livestock pumping, however, the water use surveys report pumping for several other categories (for example, municipal, mining, and manufacturing). Pumping in Gaines and Dawson counties was considered as a special case by Blandford and others (2008). In these counties, the Cretaceous-age shale separating the Ogallala Aquifer from the Edwards-Trinity (High Plains) Aquifer is relatively thin (or non-existent). Therefore, multiple wells are completed into both aquifers. Blandford and others (2008) simulated these wells used the Multi-Node Well package in MODFLOW, which only requires total pumping for wells screened in two or more aquifers, splitting the pumping based on saturated thickness and properties for the respective aquifers. Thus, the pumping estimates by Blandford and others (2008) for the Edwards-Trinity (High Plains) Aquifer in Gaines and Dawson counties are model dependent and could not be directly used for the current model. Therefore, pumping in these two counties for the Edwards-Trinity (High Plains) Aquifer was estimated as follows: \uf0b7 For irrigation pumping, the average ratio of Edwards-Trinity (High Plains) Aquifer pumping to Ogallala Aquifer pumping in 1984 and 1985, using data from the TWDB water use survey, was calculated and applied to the estimated Ogallala Aquifer pumping from 1930 through 1980. \uf0b7 For other pumping categories, the average ratio of each category to irrigation pumping in 1984 and 1985 in the TWDB water use survey data was calculated and applied to the estimated irrigation pumping to obtain pre-1980 pumping \uf0b7 Post-1980 pumping for all categories was taken from the TWDB water use survey data. Final Conceptual Model Report for the High Plains Aquifer System Groundwater Availability Model 4.7-16 For some counties, pumping for some years was missing or reported as zero in the TWDB water use survey data. In these cases, linear interpolation was used to estimate pumping for the missing years or the years with zero pumping. For example, the irrigation pumping in the TWDB water use survey data for Dawson, Gaines, Lynn, and Terry counties was zero in the years 1994 through 1999 and were linearly interpolated using the non-zero data in 1993 and 2000. Figure 4.7.23 shows the estimated pumping by category developed for the Edwards-Trinity (High Plains) Aquifer. Blandford and others (2008) investigated pumping from the Edwards- Trinity (High Plains) Aquifer in New Mexico and determined that it was small and could be neglected in the model. The same assumption is made for the High Plains Aquifer System groundwater availability model. 4.7.2.5 Rita Blanca Aquifer Pumping Dallam County is the only county with any pumping from the Rita Blanca Aquifer. The TWDB water use surveys are the only available data source for pumping in the Rita Blanca Aquifer. Though the North Plains Groundwater Conservation District does provide metered well data in Dallam County, it does not explicitly differentiate between Rita Blanca Aquifer and Ogallala Aquifer wells and so, no metered pumping can be specifically assigned to the Rita Blanca Aquifer. Rita Blanca Aquifer pumping estimates for the years 1980 through 2012 were based on the TWDB water use survey data. Pre-1980 pumping in the Rita Blanca Aquifer was estimated according to the ratio of 1980 pumping in the Rita Blanca Aquifer to 1980 pumping in the Ogallala Aquifer in Dallam County, using pre-1980 Northern Ogallala Aquifer pumping estimates (from Section 4.7.2.1). The TWDB water use survey data shows a sharp increase (approximately one order of magnitude) in pumping from the Rita Blanca Aquifer in 2004 and subsequent years. This is due to the fact that the TWDB changed the contribution of pumping between the Rita Blanca and Ogallala aquifers in 2004 and subsequent years. However, the 2003 ratio of pumping in the Rita Blanca Aquifer to pumping in the Ogallala Aquifer in Dallam County is considered more reasonable. Therefore, post-2003 pumping in the Rita Blanca Aquifer is estimated according to the 2003 ratio, using Ogallala Aquifer pumping estimates (from Section 4.7.2.1) for the years 2004 through 2012. Final Conceptual Model Report for the High Plains Aquifer System Groundwater Availability Model 4.7-17 Figure 4.7.24 shows the estimated pumping by category developed for the Rita Blanca Aquifer. Evidence of production in the Rita Blanca Aquifer is seen in hydrographs showing downward trends in Union County. Because no pumping estimates were available from previous models, pumping in the Rita Blanca Aquifer for Union County was estimated during calibration of the numerical model (Deeds and Jigmond, 2015). 4.7.2.6 Summary of Pumping Historical pumping for the aquifers of the High Plains Aquifer System region were estimated based on multiple sources of information. Given the inherent uncertainty in the estimation process at each stage, the most reliable and plausible data source was chosen. To summarize: \uf0b7 For the Northern Ogallala Aquifer, pumping was based on the existing updated Northern Ogallala Aquifer groundwater availability model (INTERA, Inc. and Dutton, 2010) from 1950 to 2008. Pumping was linearly extrapolated back to 1930 from 1950 levels. Where available, North Plains Groundwater Conservation District metering data was used to estimate irrigation pumping from 2008 to 2012. For counties without metering data or for counties only partially within the North Plains Groundwater Conservation District, the TWDB water use survey data were used to estimate post-2008 irrigation pumping. For all counties and all other pumping categories, the TWDB water use survey data were used to estimate post-1980 pumping. \uf0b7 For the Southern Ogallala Aquifer, irrigation pumping between 1958 and 1980 was based on the original Southern Ogallala Aquifer groundwater availability model (Blandford and others, 2003) and TWDB irrigation surveys (TWDB, 1991). Pumping estimates taken from Blandford and others (2003) were corrected for their assumption of irrigation return flows. Irrigation pumping after 1980 was based on crop water demand estimates made by Amosson and others (2003) and the TWDB water use survey"

For all counties and all other pumping categories, the TWDB water use survey data were used to estimate post-1980 pumping. \uf0b7 For the Southern Ogallala Aquifer, irrigation pumping between 1958 and 1980 was based on the original Southern Ogallala Aquifer groundwater availability model (Blandford and others, 2003) and TWDB irrigation surveys (TWDB, 1991). Pumping estimates taken from Blandford and others (2003) were corrected for their assumption of irrigation return flows. Irrigation pumping after 1980 was based on crop water demand estimates made by Amosson and others (2003) and the TWDB water use survey data, which were used to fill the gaps between years with Amosson and other (2003) estimates. Pumping in 1958 was extrapolated to 1930 based on early estimates of pumping from Luckey and others (1986) and the existence of early irrigation districts. Non-irrigation pumping was based on the Ogallala Aquifer pumping in the Edwards-Trinity (High Plains) groundwater availability model (Blandford and others, 2008). Post-2008 non-irrigation pumping was based on the TWDB water use survey data. Final Conceptual Model Report for the High Plains Aquifer System Groundwater Availability Model 4.7-18 \uf0b7 Pumping for the Dockum Group was taken from the Dockum Aquifer groundwater availability model (Ewing and others, 2008) and the TWDB water use surveys. Pre-1950 pumping was based on trends in regional irrigation pumping taken from the TWDB irrigation survey (TWDB, 1981). \uf0b7 Pumping in the Edwards-Trinity (High Plains) Aquifer was taken as a combination of model pumping from Blandford and others (2008) and pumping estimates from the TWDB water use surveys. \uf0b7 Pumping in the Rita Blanca Aquifer was taken from the TWDB water use surveys. \uf0b7 In all cases, corrections and adjustments were made when pumping estimates did not seem reasonable or gaps existed in the data. Figures 4.7.25 through 4.7.33 show county-wide pumping for the Ogallala, Dockum, Edwards- Trinity (High Plains), and Rita Blanca aquifers for the years 1950, 1980, and 2010. Tables 4.7.5 through 4.7.27 show pumping estimates by category for all Texas counties (grouped by Groundwater Conservation District, where applicable) for each of the four aquifers every decade from 1940 to 1990 and then every 5 years from 1990 to 2010. Tables of power and rural domestic pumping estimates for the Edwards-Trinity (High Plains) Aquifer are not included because there is no pumping from the aquifer for those two categories. Tables 4.7.28 through 4.7.30 show non-Texas pumping for the Ogallala, Rita Blanca, and Dockum aquifers for the same years. The pumping numbers shown in Tables 4.7.5 through 4.7.30 are rounded to the nearest acre-foot. If a county did not have any pumping from an aquifer in any year for a water use category, that county is not included in the table for that aquifer and water use category. In some tables, the pumping value given for all years for a county is zero, indicating that pumping for that aquifer and water use category is estimated to be zero in that county for the years shown in the table. These counties are included in the table because, even though pumping is estimated to be zero for the years shown in the table, pumping from that aquifer and that water use category is non-zero in the county for at least one year from 1930 through 2012. 4.7.2.7 Comparison of Demand-Based Pumping Estimates to Estimated Change in Storage The previous sections present the development of pumping estimates for the High Plains Aquifer System groundwater availability model based on historical estimates of pumping from a number Final Conceptual Model Report for the High Plains Aquifer System Groundwater Availability Model 4.7-19 of sources. In this section, those developed pumping estimates are referred to as demand-based estimates of pumping. For an unconfined aquifer, historical estimates of pumping can also be developed through calculation of the change in aquifer storage volume with time. This section presents calculations of estimated pumping based on changes in aquifer storage and compares those estimates to the demand-based estimates presented in the previous sections. The purpose for this comparison was to evaluate the consistency between historical demand-based estimates of pumping with observed water-level declines in the Ogallala Aquifer. This comparison is important because the primary use of groundwater from the Ogallala Aquifer is for irrigation purposes, and estimating historical irrigation pumping using a demand-based approach is difficult and results in large uncertainty. The following text first introduces and describes the approach for estimating pumping based on changes in aquifer storage and then represents and discusses the comparison between the pumping estimates from both approaches. 4.7.2.7.1 Introduction and Description of Approach Because the Ogallala Aquifer is primarily unconfined, declines in water levels correspond to drainage of water from aquifer storage. Estimating the change in storage requires only the change in water level and the specific yield of the aquifer, that is: \u2206\u0735\u0d4c\u2206\u0744\u2219\u0735\u0bec (4.7.3) where \u0394S is the change in storage per unit area of aquifer, \u0394h is the change in head (water level), and Sy is the average specific yield for that area of the aquifer. Equation 4.7.3 was used to estimate the change in storage in the Ogallala Aquifer for comparison to demand-based estimates of pumping. A direct comparison requires the assumption that sources of input to the aquifer are small compared to production, including recharge and any cross-formational flow from underlying formations. This assumption will be further addressed later in this section. In performing these estimates, three lessons were immediately learned: 1. The estimates of change in storage are very sensitive to data control, both in time and space. The method will fail in areas that lack dense monitoring networks. Final Conceptual Model Report for the High Plains Aquifer System Groundwater Availability Model 4.7-20 2. Even in data-dense regions, significant drawdown is required in order for the method to work consistently. The method will fail in areas that have small to medium historical production totals. 3.

Long-time integration is often required to achieve #2. The method will not generally work year-to-year. With these lessons in mind, the analysis was performed at several different time scales and with different data control. First, the decline estimate shown in Figure 4.3.30 was used to calculate a change in storage by county over the historical period. This estimate is considered to be most representative of the change in storage between 1950 and the present, since few data were available prior to 1950. Second, the difference between the 1950 water-level surface (Figure 4.3.27), the 1980 water-level surface (Figure 4.3.28), and the 2010 water-level surface (Figure 4.3.29) were used to estimate 30-year changes in storage (that is, 1950 to 1980 and 1980 to 2010). Note that the decline surface shown in Figure 4.3.30 was not produced by subtracting the 2010 water level surface from the 1950 water-level surface, but rather was created by analyzing wells with long-term water-level records. Figure 4.3.30 is expected to be more accurate, where decline data are available, than taking the simple difference between two estimated water-level surfaces. However, the decline shown in Figure 4.3.30 is also expected to be biased somewhat low (less decline) in areas where long-term decline data are not available. Thus, the 1950 to 2010 water- level difference was also analyzed to help provide a second estimate. The estimates discussed above are based on water level and decline surfaces that were produced using careful data analysis, supplemental data where water-level measurements were not available, and professional judgment. This type of approach could not be used for making surfaces at very short time intervals (that is, every 3 to 5 years) for the historical period within the resources of this study. Therefore, an automated tool that could quickly produce estimates of aquifer storage for any given county and year was developed. This automated tool has the advantage of speed, but the disadvantage of not having an analyst\u2019s eye on every step of the process. The tool was developed using ArcMap as a front-end, and utilizes ArcObjects libraries in the background. The workflow is as follows: Final Conceptual Model Report for the High Plains Aquifer System Groundwater Availability Model 4.7-21 1. The user points the tool to the TWDB groundwater database, accessing a view (query) that screens water-level measurements by county, aquifer, and measurement code. 2. The user indicates which months of the year are considered \u201cwinter months\u201d, and a range of years to process. 3. The tool queries the database, splits the water-level measurements out by year, and creates point coverages in ArcMap containing measurements by year. Some additional processing occurs, such as querying the 10-meter digital elevation model at each well location to ensure that the land surface datum shown in the database is reasonable. 4. The tool then interpolates the water levels by year, and does a basic volume calculation using the surface of the base of the Ogallala Aquifer and a coverage of specific yield. For the application presented here, combined estimates of specific yield from the previous northern and Southern Ogallala Aquifer groundwater availability models were used. 5. Finally, the tool uses coverages of county and groundwater conservation district boundaries to estimate volumes by county and district for the specified years. The results from this tool were tested by comparing estimates to those produced by Mullican (2012) in a study for the High Plains Water District that estimated the change in volume in storage for the period 2003 to 2012. The comparison is shown in Figure 4.7.34. Note that partial counties Deaf Smith and Randall are not shown on the figure, since the volume tool does not clip single counties to the district boundary. In general, the results are quite comparable, given the automated nature of the volume tool compared to the expert-aided approach in the Mullican (2012) study. 4.7.2.7.2 Results and Discussion A basic comparison was made between the historical demand-based pumping estimates presented in Sections 4.7.2.1 and 4.7.2.2 and the estimates of change in aquifer storage volume. Figure 4.7.35 shows the results of the 60-year (1950 to 2010) comparison between the demand- based pumping estimates, the storage change estimate based on the decline analysis (Figure 4.3.30), and the change in water-level surfaces from 1950 to 2010 (Figures 4.3.27 and 4.3.29), as discussed above. The top seven producing counties all show demand-based estimates that exceed the estimates of change in storage, often by double the amount. The two change in Final Conceptual Model Report for the High Plains Aquifer System Groundwater Availability Model 4.7-22 storage estimates are not always consistent, with the decline-based estimate typically producing the lower value. Figure 4.7.36 shows, for Hale County, a comparison of the demand-based estimates of pumping to the storage change rate estimates over various integration periods. The 60-year changes (same as Figure 4.7.35) are shown, along with 30-year (1950 to 1980 and 1980 to 2010) changes, which are based on the water-level and decline estimates (Figures 4.3.27 through 4.3.30). In addition, decadal estimates were made using the volume tool. The well counts for each year where the volume tool calculated a value of storage are also shown on the plot. The result from the volume tool is shown only for those years where more than 50 wells with measurements were available. The sensitivity of the estimate (or the variability in the estimate) to the number of wells was reviewed to arrive at this number.

The sensitivity of the estimate (or the variability in the estimate) to the number of wells was reviewed to arrive at this number. The rates of storage change shown in Figure 4.7.36 were calculated by dividing the estimated change in storage by the duration of the integration period (that is, 60, 30, or 10 years). The rate from 1930 to 1950 was assumed to increase linearly from zero in 1930 to the 1950 estimate. Figure 4.7.36 shows a large difference between the demand-based pumping estimate and the estimate based on storage change, especially in the period from 1950 to 1980. While the decadal estimate follows the same basic shape as the demand-based estimate, it is significantly lower over the 1950 to 1980 period. The previous Southern Ogallala Aquifer groundwater availability model (Blandford and others, 2008) dealt with this discrepancy by proposing that a large percentage of the irrigation water (55 to 40 percent over that 30-year period) was returned directly to the water table in the same year that it was produced (see Table 4.7.2). However, the recharge analysis described in Section 4.4 indicates that little if any irrigation return flow has occurred in Hale County, since there are only limited elevated nitrates at the water table. If 500,000 to 700,000 acre-feet per year of irrigation water (corresponding to a flux rate of 9.5 to 13 inches per year) were returned to the water table on an annual basis over two decades, significant nitrates at the water table would be expected. Based on the results from a borehole in Hale County under irrigated conditions, Scanlon and others (2010a) report that the chloride and nitrate profiles in the vadose zone indicate that irrigation water has reached less than 10 feet below ground surface (that is, irrigation return flow has not reached the water table.) Final Conceptual Model Report for the High Plains Aquifer System Groundwater Availability Model 4.7-23 With a lack of evidence for return flow, the proposed reason for the discrepancy between the rate of storage change and the demand-based pumping estimate is due to overestimation of groundwater production in the period before 1980. Figure 4.7.37 shows estimates of irrigated and total farm acreage in Hale County for 1935 (no estimate of irrigated acreage is available that year), 1954, 1974, 1997, and 2007 based on a USDA agricultural census data (U.S. Department of Agriculture, 1935, 1954, 1974, 1997, 2007). The estimate of irrigated acreage does not increase from 1954 to 1974. While data is not available from the census for the intervening years, the overall trend does not favor the extreme peaking that occurs in the demand-based pumping curve. Because Hale County was an early area of declining water levels, it is not expected that the change in storage would exactly match production, since water would move laterally in from adjacent counties where water-level elevations are higher. However, the experience of Blandford and others (2008) and the storage change analysis would indicate that the demand- based pumping estimate should be revised downward in the peak years of 1960 to 1975. The last 30 years should be able to remain relatively unmodified from the original estimate. Figures 4.7.38 and 4.7.39 show the comparison for Floyd and Parmer counties, respectively, which are examples of high production counties where the rate of storage change and the demand-based pumping curve are more closely matched. In Floyd County, where the various time integrated averages of storage change fall above and below the demand curve through time, the demand-based pumping curve looks plausible compared to the storage change. With the exception of a peak in the late 1950s, the demand curve in Parmer County looks plausible compared to the storage change. Figures 4.7.40 through 4.7.43 show more example comparisons for counties that are more like Hale County, where the peak demand-based pumping estimate in the 1960s and 1970s seems to greatly exceed the rate of storage change. Although Lamb County shows evidence of some irrigation return flow starting in the 1990s, (see Section 4.4) this would not account for the large difference in the two estimates for the period 1955 through 1970 (see Figure 4.7.40). Castro, Swisher, and Bailey counties are similar, with large differences in approximately the same time period, and the curves from the demand and storage-based estimates coming together in the 1990s. Final Conceptual Model Report for the High Plains Aquifer System Groundwater Availability Model 4.7-24 The implications of this analysis are that in the historical period, prior to around 1980, the large peak demands reported in the irrigation surveys will likely be adjusted downward for the model based on the estimates of the rate of storage change during that period. The numerical model will help inform the amount of influence from adjoining counties and, thus, the amount of downward adjustment that must occur.

Please note that, in the discussion above, salinity terms are consistent with United States Geological Survey (2012) terminology, which defines \u201cfresh\u201d as having a total dissolved solids concentration less than 1,000 milligrams per liter, \u201cslightly saline\u201d as 1,000 to 3,000 milligrams per liter, \u201cmoderately saline\u201d as 3,000 to 10,000 milligrams per liter, and \u201cvery saline\u201d as greater than 10,000 milligrams per liter. 4.8.1 Previous Studies Given their economic importance, the aquifers of the High Plains Aquifer System have been the subject of numerous reports that include water-quality discussions. In general, previous work has focused on assembling all available data in order to characterize the water chemistry of each aquifer. This approach typically treats each aquifer as an individual entity with little to no emphasis on interaction between the aquifers. On their own, hydrochemical assessments of individual aquifers are of limited use for analyzing the High Plains Aquifer System as an interconnected system. Given the distinct chemical characteristics of each aquifer, water Final Conceptual Model Report for the High Plains Aquifer System Groundwater Availability Model 4.8-2 chemistry can help highlight mixing zones created by cross-formational flow. A few studies have taken advantage of these chemistry differences to illustrate potential connections between the aquifers in the High Plains Aquifer System. Because it is the largest source of freshwater in most of the study area, the quality of groundwater in the Ogallala Aquifer has attracted particular scrutiny. Cross-formational flow into the Ogallala Aquifer is especially of interest since sufficiently large inputs from surrounding formations with poorer water quality could potentially degrade local or regional water quality in the Ogallala Aquifer. Several studies have focused on identifying areas where there is hydrochemical evidence for potential cross-formational flow into the Ogallala Aquifer. Nativ (1988) noted that the hydrochemical facies of the groundwater in the Ogallala Aquifer (sodium-bicarbonate or sodium-chloride type) is similar to that of the groundwater in the Dockum Group in parts of Deaf Smith, Parmer, Dickens, Howard, Garza, and Crosby counties, Texas and Curry County, New Mexico (Figure 4.8.1). These areas coincide with areas near the Dockum Aquifer outcrop where the hydraulic head gradient could make upward flow from the Dockum Aquifer feasible. In portions of the Midland Basin, Nativ (1988) also found that groundwater in the Ogallala Aquifer has similar hydrochemical facies, isotopic (\uf06418O and \uf064D) composition and tritium values to the underlying Edwards-Trinity (High Plains) Aquifer (Figure 4.8.1). These areas also largely coincide with regions where the hydraulic head gradient favors upward flow from the Edwards- Trinity (High Plains) Aquifer into the Ogallala Aquifer (Nativ and Gutierrez, 1988). Adding further support to the existence of cross-formational flow from the Edwards-Trinity (High Plains) Aquifer, a mass-balance calculation based on major ion concentrations in a nearby well field in Hale County indicated that 8 to 17 percent of the Ogallala Aquifer groundwater could be contributed by lateral cross-formational flow from the Edwards-Trinity (High Plains) Aquifer (McMahon and others, 2004b). Mehta and others (2000) mapped two plumes with anomalously high chloride and sulfate concentrations and depleted isotopic signatures in parts of Carson, Gray, and Roberts counties, Texas, that cover a combined area greater than 386 square miles (Figure 4.8.1). Though the total dissolved solids concentrations of the surrounding Northern Ogallala Aquifer is generally less than 400 milligrams per liter, these plumes had elevated total dissolved solids ranging from 400 Final Conceptual Model Report for the High Plains Aquifer System Groundwater Availability Model 4.8-3 to greater than 2,000 milligrams per liter. A model of the plumes indicate that the higher salinity groundwater inputs originate from underlying salt-bearing Permian-age formations (Mehta and others, 2000). Sodium-chloride type water found in the Ogallala Aquifer near the western Caprock Escarpment (Figure 4.8.1) is also thought to be due to water interacting with Permian- age salt deposits and then flowing upward through the Dockum Group (Langman, 2008). McMahon (2001) attributes the increased salinity of Ogallala Aquifer groundwater along the Cimarron River Valley to the upward flow of halite-dissolution brines from underlying Permian- age beds as well (Figure 4.8.1). Outside the Ogallala Aquifer, evidence of water chemistry changes due to cross-formational flow is poorly documented and studies are more uncommon. Nativ and Gutierrez (1988) identified areas in the northwest section of the Edwards-Trinity (High Plains) Aquifer where the hydraulic head gradient could favor upward flow from the underlying Dockum Group. In this region, the Dockum Group contains sodium-mixed anion type water transitioning to sodium-chloride type (Dutton and Simpkins, 1986), similar to the sodium-mixed anion type water and abundance of sodium and chloride in the Edwards-Trinity (High Plains) Aquifer above (Nativ and Gutierrez, 1988). This suggests the existence of cross-formational flow here. Elevated sulfate levels in the Pecos Valley Aquifer in Reeves County are attributed to flow from the underlying Rustler Formation (Ashworth, 1990). With some exceptions, as mentioned above, the hydraulic head gradients in the aquifers of the study area generally favor downward flow into underlying formations. Whether or not downward flow actually occurs and the rate at which it occurs is a function of the permeability of the contact between the two aquifers and the presence of intervening confining units. And even when aquifers are thought to be hydraulically connected, there are few documented instances in which downward mixing creates noticeable changes in water chemistry. Scanlon and others (2005b) note that elevated natural arsenic concentrations in the Edwards-Trinity Aquifer only occur in areas where it is overlain by the Ogallala Aquifer. For instance, elevated"

Scanlon and others (2005b) note that elevated natural arsenic concentrations in the Edwards-Trinity Aquifer only occur in areas where it is overlain by the Ogallala Aquifer. For instance, elevated arsenic concentrations are seen along the northern edge of the Edwards-Trinity (Plateau) Aquifer where it underlies the Ogallala Aquifer, but not elsewhere in the aquifer. The Ogallala Aquifer has elevated natural arsenic levels in the southern portion that decreases northward. Elevated arsenic levels are seen in the southern portion of the Edwards-Trinity (High Plains) Aquifer where it underlies this higher-arsenic section of the Ogallala Aquifer, but not seen in the northern portion Final Conceptual Model Report for the High Plains Aquifer System Groundwater Availability Model 4.8-4 where it underlies a lower-arsenic section of the Ogallala Aquifer. These data indicate some impact to the water quality in the Edwards-Trinity (High Plains) Aquifer due to downward flow from the Ogallala Aquifer. In Sterling County, the Dockum Group transitions to a calcium- bicarbonate type water similar to groundwater in the Edwards-Trinity (Plateau) Aquifer. Since this corresponds with an area where the Dockum Group is in hydrologic contact with the Edwards-Trinity (Plateau) Aquifer (Walker, 1979), this has been interpreted as evidence of downward groundwater movement (Ashworth and Christian, 1989; Bradley and Kalaswad, 2003). The Dockum Group is noted to transition to a calcium-sulfate-mixed anion-type water when overlain by the Pecos Valley Aquifer (Bradley and Kalaswad, 2003), also potentially indicating downward movement. Besides cross-formational flow, groundwater chemistry can also offer insight into the rate and path of surface recharge to an aquifer. Dutton (1995), for instance, used isotopic composition (\uf06418O and \uf064D) and other age tracers (14C and 3H) in High Plains groundwater to establish that unconfined Ogallala Group groundwater was young (0 to 1,000 years) and derived from meteoric input. Confined Dockum Group groundwater was older (15,000 to 35,000 years) and derived from vertical leakage from the Ogallala Aquifer above. Tritium values show a stratification of age in the Ogallala Aquifer, in that groundwater at the water table is typically less than 50 years old whereas deep Ogallala Aquifer water is greater than 50 years old (McMahon, 2001; McMahon and others, 2004b). The appearance of recent agricultural inputs such as nitrate and pesticides in groundwater can also be used to establish recent origin. Fahlquist (2003) used the presence of nitrate and pesticides combined with tritium values to date water in southern Ogallala Aquifer wells as less than 50 years old. Changes in groundwater chemistry can also provide information on surface processes, both natural and anthropogenic. These surface processes can potentially affect all aquifers in outcrop areas where they are essentially unconfined. Most available documentation focuses on the Ogallala and Pecos Valley aquifers, which are unconfined throughout much of their extent. Some saline plumes in the Ogallala Aquifer are thought to be the result of eolian sediment transport from saline lake basins and the subsequent dissolution and transport of salts to the water table (Wood and Sanford, 1995b). While that process is largely natural, most other surface processes with an impact on groundwater are anthropogenic. Irrigation, in what is otherwise an arid to Final Conceptual Model Report for the High Plains Aquifer System Groundwater Availability Model 4.8-5 semi-arid area, mobilizes dissolved solids in the unsaturated zone and increases groundwater flux rate and thus transport of dissolved solids to the water table (McMahon and others, 2006). Before recharging, irrigation water can undergo evaporation at the surface and become more saline, also increasing the amount of dissolved solids transported to the water table. This is likely the source of salinity in the Pecos Valley Aquifer in Reeves County and northwest Pecos County (Ashworth, 1990). The application of fertilizer and pesticides at the surface leads to the appearance of these anthropogenic contaminants at the water table. McMahon and others (2004b) identified a distinct stratification in the groundwater chemistry of the Ogallala Aquifer with shallow water near the water table showing high total dissolved solids, nitrate and pesticide levels and dilute deep water showing little to no contamination. High nitrate levels found in the Pecos Valley Aquifer in parts of Reeves and Pecos counties are also likely due to agricultural surface application (Ashworth, 1990). Contamination from surface industrial waste can also change groundwater chemistry. Local high-salinity portions of the Pecos Valley Aquifer in Winkler and Loving counties are attributed to the improper surface disposal of oil-field brines (Ashworth, 1990). Even without the direct input of agricultural and industrial contamination, humans can also alter groundwater chemistry by simple water withdrawal. Declines in water level can induce changes in the flow system that then manifest themselves as changes in water chemistry. Water-level declines have induced recharge from the Pecos River, introducing its poor quality (high total dissolved solids) water to portions of the Pecos Valley and Edwards-Trinity (Plateau) aquifers in northwestern Pecos and north-central Reeves counties (Ashworth, 1990; Barker and Ardis, 1996). While the stratification of water quality in the Ogallala Aquifer has prevented the contamination of deep wells, future water-level declines could eventually pull saline, nitrate- contaminated water, currently isolated at the water table, into deeper wells. Deep wells, particularly oil and gas wells, can lead to contamination when poorly cased wells leak and introduce shorter flow paths for poorer quality water from deeper formations. Nativ (1988) suggested that formation brines leaking from old oil and gas wells contributed to the higher total dissolved solids levels found in the Southern Ogallala Aquifer compared to the Northern Ogallala Aquifer. High chloride in Edwards-Trinity (Plateau) Aquifer groundwater has also been blamed on oil field brine leakage from poorly cased or plugged wells"

Final Conceptual Model Report for the High Plains Aquifer System Groundwater Availability Model 4.8-6 Due to the temporal scarcity of water quality measurements, few studies have been able to use water chemistry to quantify changes due to irrigation and other agricultural practices over time, or to establish any pre-development water chemistry baseline. Groundwater dating techniques combined with nitrogen isotope data have been used to establish pre- and post-development nitrate concentrations in the Ogallala Aquifer (McMahon and others, 2004a; McMahon and B\u00f6hlke, 2006). These show that pre-development nitrate concentrations remained steady for thousands of years and began to sharply increase in the 1940s and 1950s, coincident with greater agricultural activity and fertilizer application. Dutton (2005) did also identify a slightly increasing nitrate trend in the Dockum Group from the 1930s to the 2000s. While groundwater chemistry does demonstrate some impact from agricultural input over the past half-century, data are insufficient to quantify recharge amounts and rates of different constituents and relate them to specific changes in irrigation practices at the timescale of our model. 4.8.2 Data Sources and Methods of Analysis The water-quality data used in the current analysis is from the TWDB groundwater database for wells located within Texas and from the United States Geological Survey National Water Information System database for wells located outside of Texas. If a well had screen information or total depth, the well was assigned to an aquifer based on the updated structural surfaces created for this project (see Section 4.2). Wells that were screened across several aquifers were not included in the analysis since the water chemistry would not be representative of either aquifer. Because of the scarcity of data, we also included data from wells without screen information that were designated as Edwards-Trinity (High Plains) Aquifer or Rita Blanca Aquifer wells in the TWDB groundwater database. This groundwater water quality analysis included 4,919 wells completed within the Ogallala Aquifer, 818 wells within the lower Dockum Group, 80 wells in the upper Dockum Group, 22 in the Rita Blanca Aquifer, and 58 in the Edwards-Trinity (High Plains) Aquifer. For the purpose of statistical evaluation and mapping, only the most recent sampling event for a given parameter was chosen from each well. The most recent data were used in order to assess the most current status of the quality of groundwater. Final Conceptual Model Report for the High Plains Aquifer System Groundwater Availability Model 4.8-7 4.8.3 Drinking Water Quality Screening levels for drinking water supply are based on the maximum contaminant levels established by the Environmental Protection Agency. Primary maximum contaminant levels are legally enforceable standards that apply to public water systems to protect human health from contaminants in drinking water. Secondary maximum contaminant levels are non-enforceable guidelines for drinking water contaminants that may cause aesthetic effects (taste, color, odor, and foaming), cosmetic effects (skin or tooth discoloration), and technical effects (corrosivity, expensive water treatment, plumbing fixture staining, scaling, and sediment). Tables 4.8.1 through 4.8.5 summarizes the occurrence and levels of some commonly measured groundwater quality constituents in the Ogallala Aquifer, upper and lower Dockum Group, Rita Blanca Aquifer, and Edwards-Trinity (High Plains) Aquifer, respectively. Total dissolved solids, a measure of salinity, is the sum of concentrations of all dissolved ions (such as sodium, calcium, magnesium, potassium, chloride, sulfate, carbonates) plus silica. Some dissolved solids, such as calcium, give water a pleasant taste, but most make water taste salty, bitter, or metallic. Dissolved solids can also increase the corrosiveness of water. The total dissolved solids level has exceeded the secondary maximum contaminant level of 500 milligrams per liter in approximately 38 percent of the sampled Ogallala wells, 50 percent of the sampled upper Dockum Group wells, 67 percent of the sampled lower Dockum Group wells, 6 percent of the sampled Rita Blanca Aquifer wells, and 93 percent of the sampled Edwards-Trinity (High Plains) wells. Figure 4.8.2 shows the spatial distribution of total dissolved solids in Ogallala Aquifer groundwater, Figure 4.8.3 shows Dockum Group groundwater, and Figure 4.8.4 shows Rita Blanca and Edwards-Trinity (High Plains) aquifers groundwater. The concentration of total dissolved solids in groundwater in the Ogallala Aquifer is low in the northern portion of the aquifer but increases significantly in the southern portion. The total dissolved solids in groundwater in the Dockum Group generally increases with depth toward the center of the depositional basin. Groundwater in the Dockum Group that is sufficiently fresh to meet safe-drinking water standards is limited to the shallower areas near and on the outcrop of the Dockum Aquifer. All available Rita Blanca Aquifer groundwater samples are fresh. Edwards-Trinity (High Plains) Aquifer groundwater is also generally fresh, but does increase in total dissolved solids towards the south. Final Conceptual Model Report for the High Plains Aquifer System Groundwater Availability Model 4.8-8 Sulfate and chloride are major components of total dissolved solids. The secondary maximum contaminant level for both sulfate and chloride is 250 milligrams per liter. Fourteen percent of sampled Ogallala Aquifer wells, 24 percent of sampled upper Dockum Group wells, 43 percent of lower Dockum Group wells, and 59 percent of the Edwards-Trinity (High Plains) Aquifer wells exceeded this level for sulfate. Eleven percent of sampled Ogallala Aquifer wells, 22 percent of sampled upper Dockum Group wells, 31 percent of lower Dockum Group wells, and 56 percent of the Edwards-Trinity (High Plains) Aquifer wells exceeded this level for chloride.

None of the sampled Rita Blanca Aquifer wells exceeded 250 milligrams per liter for either sulfate or chloride. Fluoride is a naturally-occurring element found in most rocks. At very low concentrations, fluoride is a beneficial nutrient. For instance, at a concentration of 1 milligram per liter, fluoride helps to prevent dental cavities. However, at concentrations above the secondary maximum contaminant level of 2 milligrams per liter, fluoride can stain children's teeth. This level is exceeded in 51 percent of the sampled Ogallala wells, 28 percent of the sampled lower Dockum Group wells, 59 percent of the sampled upper Dockum Group wells, 10 percent of the sampled Rita Blanca Aquifer wells, and 64 percent of the sampled Edwards-Trinity (High Plains) wells. At concentrations above the primary maximum contaminant level of 4 milligrams per liter, fluoride can cause a type of bone disease. This level is exceeded in 17 percent of the sampled Ogallala Aquifer wells, 9 percent of the sampled upper Dockum Group wells, 4 percent of the sampled lower Dockum Group wells, 5 percent of the sampled Rita Blanca Aquifer wells, and 22 percent of the sampled Edwards-Trinity (High Plains) wells. Nitrate, which is often indicative of agricultural contamination, is another potentially hazardous constituent of drinking water. Since high concentrations of nitrate can cause serious illness in infants younger than 6 months old, the EPA established a primary maximum contaminant level of 10 milligrams of nitrate per liter as nitrogen. This level is exceeded in 5 percent of the sampled Ogallala Aquifer wells, 10 percent of the upper Dockum Group wells, 11 percent of the lower Dockum Group wells, and 14 percent of the Edwards-Trinity (High Plains) Aquifer wells. None of the available Rita Blanca Aquifer samples exceeded 10 milligrams per liter. Figures 4.8.5 through 4.8.7 show the distribution of nitrate in groundwater samples in the Ogallala Aquifer, Dockum Group, Rita Blanca Aquifer, and Edwards-Trinity (High Plains) Aquifer, respectively. Final Conceptual Model Report for the High Plains Aquifer System Groundwater Availability Model 4.8-9 Arsenic can be another hazardous, but often naturally-occurring, component of groundwater. Since long-term exposure can cause various forms of cancer, arsenic has a primary maximum concentration of 10 micrograms per liter. This level is exceeded in 19 percent of Ogallala aquifer wells, 27 percent of upper Dockum Group wells, 7 percent of lower Dockum Group wells, and 27 percent of Edwards-Trinity (High Plains) Aquifer wells. None of the available Rita Blanca Aquifer samples exceeded 10 micrograms per liter. Figures 4.8.8 through 4.8.10 show the distribution of arsenic in groundwater samples in the Ogallala Aquifer, Dockum Group, Rita Blanca Aquifer, and Edwards-Trinity (High Plains) Aquifer, respectively. 4.8.4 Irrigation Water Quality The utility of groundwater from the High Plains Aquifer System for crop irrigation was evaluated based on its salinity hazard, sodium hazard, and concentration of chloride. Although crops can differ in their tolerance of high salinity, saline irrigation water is generally undesirable as it limits the ability of plants to take up water from soils. The salinity hazard classification system of the United States Salinity Laboratory (1954) classifies waters with electrical conductivity over 750 micromhos as a high salinity hazard, and those with electrical conductivity over 2,250 micromhos as a very high salinity hazard. Of the wells in the Ogallala Aquifer with chemical analyses, groundwater from 43 percent have exhibited a high salinity hazard and 8 percent exhibited a very high salinity hazard. In the upper and lower Dockum aquifers, 68 and 73 percent exhibited a high salinity hazard, respectively, and 14 and 31 percent have exhibited a very high salinity hazard, respectively. In the Rita Blanca Aquifer, only one well showed a high salinity hazard and none had a very high salinity hazard. In the Edwards-Trinity (High Plains), 96 percent exhibited a high salinity hazard and 54 percent have exhibited a very high salinity hazard. Groundwater with a high sodium concentration compared to other major ion concentrations can negatively affect soil cultivation and permeability in irrigated land. A sodium hazard condition generally results when the sodium concentration in water is in excess of 60 percent of total cations. The sodium hazard of groundwater is typically calculated in terms of sodium adsorption ratio (United States Salinity Laboratory, 1954): \u0735\u074b\u0740\u0745\u0751\u0749 \u0723\u0740\u074f\u074b\u074e\u074c\u0750\u0745\u074b\u074a \u0734\u073d\u0750\u0745\u074b\u0d4c \u0bc7\u0bd4 \u0da7\u0cb4\u0ccc\u0c36\u0cbe\u0cd2 \u0c2e (4.8.1) Final Conceptual Model Report for the High Plains Aquifer System Groundwater Availability Model 4.8-10 where the sodium (Na), calcium (Ca), and magnesium (Mg) concentrations are expressed in milliequivalents per liter. The United States Salinity Laboratory (1954) classifies groundwater into low (less than 10), medium (10 to 18), high (18 to 26), and very high (greater than 26) sodium adsorption ratio ranges. In the Ogallala Aquifer, less than 1 percent of the wells fall into the high or very high categories. In the upper Dockum Group, 8 percent of groundwater samples have a high sodium hazard and 5 percent have a very high sodium hazard. In the lower Dockum Group, 19 percent of groundwater samples have a high sodium hazard and 16 percent have a very high sodium hazard. In the Edwards-Trinity (High Plains) Aquifer, 11 percent of groundwater samples have a high sodium hazard and 5 percent have a very high sodium hazard. None of the Rita Blanca Aquifer samples show a high or very high sodium hazard. The sodium hazard (sodium adsorption ratio) of groundwater for the Ogallala Aquifer, Dockum Group, Rita Blanca Aquifer, and Edwards-Trinity (High Plains) Aquifer are shown in Figures 4.8.11"

Most crops cannot tolerate chloride levels above 1,000 milligrams per liter for an extended period of time (Tanji, 1990). Only 2 percent of the sampled Ogallala Aquifer wells have a chloride concentration greater than 1,000 milligrams per liter. However, this chloride concentration is exceeded in 4 percent of upper Dockum Group wells, 12 percent of lower Dockum Group wells, and 18 percent of Edwards-Trinity (High Plains) Aquifer wells. None of the Rita Blanca Aquifer wells had a chloride concentration that exceeded 1,000 milligrams per liter.

Final Conceptual Model Report for the High Plains Aquifer System Groundwater Availability Model 5.0-1 5.0 Conceptual Model of Groundwater Flow for the High Plains Aquifer System Groundwater Availability Model The conceptual model for groundwater flow in the High Plains Aquifer System is based on the hydrogeologic setting described in Section 4. The conceptual model is a simplified representation of the hydrogeological features that govern groundwater flow in the aquifer. In addition to identifying the hydrostratigraphic layers of the aquifer, the conceptual model also describes factors influencing groundwater flow through the aquifer, defines the mechanisms of recharge and natural aquifer discharge, and quantifies anthropogenic stresses such as pumping. These components of the model are discussed below. The steady-state model will represent the High Plains Aquifer System in its pre-development condition, which is represented as conditions prior to about 1930. Although cultivation was well under way by 1930, groundwater irrigation was minimal, and the effects of land use on percolation had yet to strongly impact recharge at the water table. Under steady-state conditions, the aquifer system is unaffected by anthropogenic activities and is in long-term dynamic equilibrium. In this pre-development state, aquifer recharge is balanced by aquifer discharge resulting in no net change in groundwater storage. Figure 5.0.1 shows the location of two cross- sections in the study area. Figure 5.0.2 shows the structure cross-section W1-E1 in the northern part of the study area, annotated with pre-development recharge and discharge features. The lower half of the figure is a block schematic with similar annotation showing the proposed numerical model layer scheme. The formations dip strongly from west to east, following land surface. The Ogallala Aquifer is largely unconfined and, under pre-development conditions, was recharged by precipitation, with focused recharge occurring in playa lakes. Groundwater flow generally followed the topography, with west to east flow in the Northern Ogallala Aquifer. These regional flow patterns were locally diverted in topographically low areas. Discharge occurred through springs, streams, and saline lakes. Some discharge occurred through evapotranspiration in riparian areas. Some discharge exited the aquifer as cross-formational flow, recharging the underlying aquifers, such as the Rita Blanca Aquifer. Except in its outcrop area, the Rita Blanca Aquifer is overlain by the Ogallala Aquifer. Under pre-development conditions, the aquifer was recharged by precipitation in the outcrop area and by downward flow from the Ogallala Aquifer in some areas. In general, groundwater flowed Final Conceptual Model Report for the High Plains Aquifer System Groundwater Availability Model 5.0-2 downdip towards the southeast. Discharge occurred at springs and small streams in the Rita Blanca Aquifer outcrop and as cross-formational flow to the underlying Dockum Aquifer. The Edwards-Trinity (High Plains) Aquifer is largely under confined conditions, and is overlain by the Ogallala Aquifer throughout its entire extent. Under pre-development conditions, recharge occurred through downward flow from the Ogallala Aquifer. Because the upper formations (Duck Creek and Kiamichi) of the Edwards-Trinity (High Plains) Aquifer exhibit high shale and clay content, the greatest potential for interaction occurs where these formations are thin or eroded away. Regional groundwater flow in the aquifer was to the southeast. Some discharge occurred at surficial saline lakes and as cross-formational flow downward into the Dockum Aquifer. The upper and lower Dockum aquifers are under confined conditions except in outcrop areas. Under pre-development conditions, the aquifer was recharged by precipitation in the outcrop where the lower Dockum Aquifer is exposed. This recharge did not move very far downdip but, rather, discharged locally to springs and streams. The subcrop of the Dockum Group is no longer an active groundwater flow system and has received little to no recharge since the Pleistocene. The shallow active portion of the Dockum Aquifer near the outcrops receives recharge from the overlying Ogallala, Edwards-Trinity (High Plains), and Pecos Valley aquifers. The locations where cross-formational flow recharges the Dockum Aquifer is generally limited to areas where the upper Dockum Aquifer is missing and the lower Dockum Aquifer is relatively shallow, as is the case along the eastern edge of the aquifer. In areas where the upper Dockum Aquifer is present, its low permeability mudstone likely restricts downward flow from the overlying Ogallala and Edwards-Trinity (High Plains) aquifers. Some small amount of groundwater may also flow vertically from the overlying Edwards-Trinity (Plateau) Aquifer to the Dockum Aquifer. The transient model will represent the High Plains Aquifer System during its post-development stage. In this period, human activities altered the dynamic equilibrium of the pre-development flow system through pumping withdrawals, changes in recharge through development and irrigation return flow, and changes in vegetation. Figure 5.0.3 shows the structure cross-section W2-E2 in the southern part of the study area, annotated with post-development recharge and discharge features. Final Conceptual Model Report for the High Plains Aquifer System Groundwater Availability Model 5.0-3 In the Ogallala Aquifer, post-development irrigation pumping has significantly lowered the Ogallala Aquifer water table and locally affected groundwater flow direction as discussed in Section 4.3. Pumping is now the largest discharge mechanism in the Ogallala Aquifer. Most of the pumping discharge is offset by a decrease in aquifer storage.

Final Conceptual Model Report for the High Plains Aquifer System Groundwater Availability Model 5.0-3 In the Ogallala Aquifer, post-development irrigation pumping has significantly lowered the Ogallala Aquifer water table and locally affected groundwater flow direction as discussed in Section 4.3. Pumping is now the largest discharge mechanism in the Ogallala Aquifer. Most of the pumping discharge is offset by a decrease in aquifer storage. Figure 5.0.4 shows a plot of the estimated drawdown from pre-development water levels versus the pre-development saturated thickness in the Southern Ogallala Aquifer (Scanlon and others, 2010a). Drawdown is based on the difference between the earliest water level available (average 1958) and 2002 water levels. The values shown are representative of the northern and southern portions of the Southern Ogallala Aquifer, separated by the 500 milligram per liter total dissolved solids contour (see Figure 5.0.1). In both portions, the largest amount of pumping and corresponding drawdown clearly occurred where the initial saturated thickness was largest. This relationship can help guide where to place pumping in the model. Some of the pumping discharge is offset by capture, with decreased discharge to springs, streams, and other surface discharge features. Many springs have either experienced reduced flow or dried up completely. Streams and draws that were originally fed by springs or aquifer discharge also have reduced or no flow. As discussed in Section 4.4, post-development conversion of rangeland to cultivated land increased percolation in certain local areas due to changes in the soil character, and decreases in evapotranspiration and runoff. Irrigation return flow also increased percolation. However, enhanced percolation does not immediately appear as recharge to the water table. In some counties, such as Dawson, the enhanced percolation recharged the Ogallala Aquifer early, prior to 1940. Some areas in that region show steady or increasing water levels, indicating recharge in excess of discharge. Other counties in the Southern Ogallala Aquifer region show evidence of enhanced recharge from cultivation and/or irrigation beginning in the 1970s through 1990s. In the Northern Ogallala Aquifer region, unsaturated zone borehole profiles indicate that the conversion to cultivated agricultural land has had little to no impact on recharge, likely due to the presence of restrictive underlying soil layers. Post-development recharge in this region therefore remains close to pre-development rates. Similar to the Ogallala Aquifer, the Rita Blanca Aquifer generally shows a decline in water levels due to increased pumping discharge, which is balanced by reduced groundwater storage, less cross-formational flow, and reduced groundwater storage. The decline in the Edwards- Trinity (High Plains) Aquifer water levels is not as pronounced or as uniformly distributed as in Final Conceptual Model Report for the High Plains Aquifer System Groundwater Availability Model 5.0-4 the Ogallala or Rita Blanca aquifers. The increased discharge from pumping is balanced by decreased discharge to saline lakes, less cross-formational flow, and reduced groundwater storage. The upper Dockum Aquifer does not show a change from pre-development conditions north of the Canadian River. In the southern portion of the aquifer, minor water-level declines are observed across the entire aquifer with higher declines concentrated in northeastern Deaf Smith County and south-central Swisher County as described in Section 4.3. The increase in discharge via pumping is likely balanced by a decrease in discharge as cross-formational flow. As shown in Section 4.3, the lower Dockum Aquifer has shown a more consistently distributed decline in water level than in the upper Dockum Aquifer. The highest declines are seen in northwestern Pecos County and along the border of Curry and Roosevelt counties, New Mexico. In a few local areas, particularly in the Colorado River outcrop area, increased recharge due to irrigation return flow appears to offset this increased discharge through pumping. Elsewhere, discharge through pumping is offset by reduced natural discharge to springs and streams in outcrop areas and cross-formational flow. Figures 5.0.2 and 5.0.3 contain block schematics of the formations presented in the cross- sections, and their proposed numerical model layer representations. The numerical model will consist of four layers. In the northern and central portions of the study area, Layer 1 represents the Ogallala Aquifer. In the southern portion of the study area, Layer 1 will represent the Pecos Valley Aquifer. Although the Pecos Valley Aquifer is not explicitly modeled as part of the High Plains Aquifer System, it is included to provide a reasonable head boundary for the underlying Dockum Aquifer in areas where the Ogallala Aquifer is absent. Layer 2 represents the Rita Blanca Aquifer in the northern portion of the study area, the Edwards-Trinity (High Plains) Aquifer in the central portion of the study area, and the Edwards-Trinity (Plateau) Aquifer in the southern portion of the study area. Like the Pecos Valley Aquifer, the Edwards-Trinity (Plateau) Aquifer is not considered part of the High Plains Aquifer System, but is included in the model to provide a reasonable head boundary for the underlying Dockum Aquifer. Model Layers 3 and 4 represent the upper and lower Dockum aquifers, respectively, in all areas of the model. The top of the Permian-age sediments forms the no-flow bottom boundary of the model.

Final Conceptual Model Report for the High Plains Aquifer System Groundwater Availability Model 6.0-1 6.0 Future Improvements In this section, recommendations for potential future improvements in the conceptual model are provided. Additional ideas may occur through the continued stakeholder process and the development of the numerical model. The recommendations are approximately grouped when applicable, according to the sections in Chapter 4. Hydrostratigraphy and Structure The current work provides a regional structural framework based on geophysical log analysis, with supplemental local estimates of Ogallala Aquifer bottom from driller log analyses, where available. As additional analyses, either geophysical log or driller log, become available, they could be added to the dataset used to build the surfaces, improving resolution in those areas. Hydraulic Heads The Ogallala Aquifer contains an extensive water level monitoring network. However, the minor aquifers, including the Dockum, Rita Blanca, and Edwards Trinity (High Plains) aquifers, have fewer measurements. Wells are often only partially completed in the minor aquifers making interpretation of water levels challenging. As these minor aquifers continue to be developed, new wells and data will become available to help refine the water level estimates. This is especially true for analyzing vertical flow between the aquifers, which is currently difficult to assess using water levels because of sparcity of data, and lack of nearby well pairs clearly screened in different units. Recharge Recharge has been studied extensively in the Ogallala Aquifer. Additional field studies in the Dockum Aquifer outcrop could help improve estimates of recharge in the aquifer. Hydraulic Properties Similar to water levels, continued development of the minor aquifers should bring access to more aquifer tests and geophysical logs to help increase resolution of hydraulic conductivity data. What would be especially useful would be an aquifer test specifically in one formation, with monitoring in the over- or underlying formation, to allow for some estimate of the vertical Final Conceptual Model Report for the High Plains Aquifer System Groundwater Availability Model 6.0-2 conductivity between the formations. Continued development of the minor aquifers will cause cross-formational flow to become an increasingly important factor, especially given the difference in water quality among the aquifers that compose the High Plains Aquifer System. Pumping The vast majority of agricultural pumping in the Ogallala does not have rate measurements at the wellhead or at the pivot. In the absence of these measurements, other strategies, such as GIS-based analyses of crop water use, might improve estimates of production. Water Quality Similar to water levels and hydraulic properties, additional wells in the minor aquifers will bring additional water quality information that could be useful in improving the characterization of water quality in the minor aquifers. Additionally, characterization of the brackish portions of the aquifers is becoming more important. Data is currently somewhat limited in many of the fresh-brackish transition zones, especially in the Dockum Aquifer.

The purpose of this map is to illustrate how all the aquifers of the High Plains Aquifer System are spatially related with each other, which is not immediately clear when the aquifers are split out into different maps. Later maps (Figure 2.0.5 and 2.0.6) provide separate maps of just major and just minor aquifers, respectively, if necessary.

Please update the chapter to include a discussion on horizontal anisotropy. We found no evidence in the literature for regional horizontal anisotropy in the High Plains Aquifer System. We added text to this effect at the end of Section 4.6.5. 111. Section 4.6.5: per Exhibit B, Attachment 1 of the contract (Section 4.4.1, pages 18-20), please include histograms of hydraulic conductivity, storativity, and specific storage (if applicable) for each model layer. Histograms were not included. The hydraulic conductivity and specific yield coverages developed for the current model were based on existing coverages developed in previous reports, not point data. Text modified in Section 4.6.5.1 to clarify this point. Information on the raw data used to create these existing coverages is available in the source material reports. Any new data points added during this Final Conceptual Model Report for the High Plains Aquifer System Groundwater Availability Model A-19 study (that is Tables 4.6.1, 4.6.2, 4.6.3, and 4.6.5) were only used to modify the existing coverage in place, not added to an original raw point dataset. The small sample size of these additional datasets was not appropriate for histogram plotting and also, would be misleading since it is not representative of all of the data used to create the final coverages. No point measurements for specific storage were available to create a histogram. 112. Section 4.6.5, pages 4.6-4 to 4.6-8: per Exhibit A (pages 9 and 14, paragraph 4) of the contract, specific yield will be revised based on new geophysical data, primarily porosity measurements from geophysical logs. The Conceptual Model report makes no mention of this analysis being performed. The report mentions the range of values for the study, 0.025 to 0.28 (page 4.6-10), but does not mention where those values came from. Please document the source of the specific yield values in the text of the report. If the geophysical log analysis was not performed please explain why in the text of the report. Specific yield would be correlated to porosity and other factors, but estimates of porosity based on geophysical logs require a neutron porosity log. There were only a handful of these logs available in the log database, therefore these estimates were not possible, and we relied on previous studies for estimates of specific yield. Text has been added to this effect in Section 4.6.7.1. Text has also been modified to clarify that the range 0.025 to 0.28 refers to Dutton and others (2001a) and that the range 0.025 - 0.28 refers to McGuire and others (2012). 113. Page 4.6-6, Paragraph 3, Section 4.6.5, and Figures 4.6.5, 4.67, and 4.6.8: per Exhibit B (page 19) of the contract please include locations of point values of hydraulic conductivity on the figures, if feasible. The hydraulic conductivity coverages shown in Figures 4.6.5 \u2013 4.6.8 were created based on existing coverages developed in previous reports, not point data. The few new data points incorporated into the existing coverages are shown in Figure 4.6.4 for the Ogallala Aquifer and Figure 4.6.9 for the Dockum Aquifer. 114.

The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service National Wetlands Inventory include mapped riparian zones\u2014please see http://www.fws.gov/wetlands/Other/Riparian-Product-Summary.html for more information concerning downloading the dataset. Using the Wetlands Mapper, riparian zones were included in the dataset for the study area. Please consider investigating this dataset for applying evapotranspiration in the study area. Upon review of the riparian coverage, we found that many areas along streams that appear to be influenced by the stream (that is, are green and vegetated) were inconsistently reflected in the coverage. Therefore we decided not to use the coverage as the basis for evapotranspiration in the numerical model. This is discussed in the numerical model report as well. 121. Pages 4.7-4 to 4.7-22 Section 4.7.2: per Exhibit A (page 11, paragraph 3) of the contract, in addition to the change in storage estimates which were compared to demand based Final Conceptual Model Report for the High Plains Aquifer System Groundwater Availability Model A-21 pumping estimates, a remote-sensing based water-balance estimates will be evaluated such as the USGS study from Stanton [and others] (2011) for comparison to estimates of groundwater pumping. The remote-sensing analysis is not documented in the conceptual model report. If the analysis was not performed, please explain why in the text of report. Otherwise please discuss this in the text of the report. Text added to Section 4.7.2.1 to explain why these pumping estimates were not incorporated. 122. Pages 4.7-5 to 4.7-8, 4.7-15, Section 4.7.2.1 and 4.7.2.5, and Figure 4.7.6: it is unclear how pumping in Dallam County will be adjusted. Existing models combined the Rita Blanca Aquifer with the Ogallala Aquifer and all associated pumping with both aquifers should have been applied in the model. It is assumed with this new model that pumping from the Rita Blanca Aquifer (Section 4.7.2.5) will be applied in the associated model layer; however, the text does not discuss reducing the pumping for the Ogallala Aquifer layer to reflect this refinement (note pumping from the model in Figure 4.7.6 should be the combination of pumping from the Ogallala and Rita Blanca aquifers). Please clarify in the text of the report. In addition, please clarify in Section 4.7.2.5 that North Plains Groundwater Conservation District did not have metered data for wells completed in the Rita Blanca Aquifer. And finally Section 4.7.2.5 on page 4.7-16 states pumping in the Rita Blanca Aquifer in New Mexico was assumed negligible; however, hydrographs in wells 363041103054601 and 361847103064701 indicate 40 feet to over 100 feet decline in water levels, please clarify in the text. Section 4.7.2.5 explains how assignments of Rita Blanca Aquifer pumping were based on the 2003 ratio of Rita Blanca Aquifer pumping to Ogallala Aquifer pumping for post-2004 and on the 1980 ratio for pre-1980 pumping. Text reworded slightly for clarity. Text also added to indicate that the North Plains Groundwater Conservation District does not explicitly delineate between Rita Blanca and Ogallala wells, therefore the metered data also makes no such delineation. Pumping in the Rita Blanca was added for Union County (Table 4.7.29). Text in Section 4.7.5 revised to reflect this. 123.

The values plotted on the graphs appear to be significantly different; for example the maximum pumping in Hale County is 760,128 acre-feet in 1960 per Table 4.7.12 and on Figure 4.7.36 pumping/Demand Est is over 1,000,000 acre-feet for around the same timeframe. Table 4.7.12 shows total pumping every 10 years, whereas the figure plots the full time-series.

Please re-visit text and figure so they agree. The text is correct. The figures erroneously highlighted samples with values equal to the threshold of 10 micrograms per liter. The figure (as well as the other figures in this chapter) have been revised so that the highlighted samples only include values exceeding the threshold and do not include values equal to the threshold. This approach is consistent with the statistics shown in Tables 4.8.1-4.8.5 and discussed in the text. Note that Figures 4.8.2-4.8.4 and 4.8.14-4.8.16 have been revised to use 500 mg/L total dissolved solids and 250 mg/L chloride thresholds, respectively, to be consistent with the EPA drinking water thresholds used in the text and tables, rather than the Texas drinking water thresholds. 132.

For example, northern saline plume (Mehta and others, 2000) shows all freshwater in Figure 4.8.2 as well as the area of mixed Dockum and Ogallala in Deaf Smith and Parmer counties (Nativ, 1988). Since Mehta and others (2000) define the \u201csaline\u201d plumes based on comparison to the low-salinity Northern Ogallala Aquifer, their total dissolved solids \u201csaline\u201d threshold is 400 mg/L, much lower than the 1,000 mg/L threshold used in Figure 4.8.2. The word \u201csaline\u201d has therefore been removed from the discussion of the Mehta and others (2000) study, as it is confusing and inconsistent with the word\u2019s use in the rest of the current report. The area in Deaf Smith and Parmer discussed in Nativ (1988) is defined based on a hydrochemical facies analysis. This depends on the chemical make-up of the water, rather than absolute value of total dissolved solids and so is not necessarily expected to be visible in Figure 4.8.2. In general, evidence of cross- formational flow and mixing is more subtle than drastic changes in water chemistry that cause exceedances of drinking or agricultural water standards.

Page 8.0-23, References: the TWDB website URL is now www.twdb.texas.gov/ : it is no longer www.twdb.state.tx.us. Please revise 10 TWDB references to the current TWDB website URL. Corrected. Draft BRACS comments to be addressed: 142. Please provide readme file within the BRACS_db folder with a brief explanation of the database and its contents. Added. 143. 108 digital (LAS) geophysical well logs are referenced on page 4.2-1. Please provide these logs to TWDB. Added. 144. Bracs Database table HP_GAM_tblWell_Geology stratigraphic records need to be edited so that the top, bottom, and thickness (if known) of each distinct geologic unit are listed in one record. The present data has many records in which the top of a unit and the base of a unit are in two separate records. Corrected. 145. Bracs Database table HP_GAM_tblWell_Geology stratigraphic records need to be edited so that missing top, bottom, and thickness values are recorded, if known. The present data has many records that are incomplete but could be made complete. Corrected. 146. Bracs Database table HP_GAM_tblWell_Geology records need to be edited so that missing information in the following fields is added: [source_geologic_data], [initials], and [last_change]. Corrected. 147. Bracs Database table HP_GAM_tblWell_Geology records need to be edited so that the [source_geologic_data] is accurate. There are hundreds of records showing base of Ogallala that indicate a geophysical well log was used for this stratigraphic pick. We assume water well reports were used for many of these wells. Corrected. 148. Bracs Database table HP_GAM_tblWell_Location field [well_type] records need to be edited so that the full name (tblLkWellType field well_type) is listed in this field and not Final Conceptual Model Report for the High Plains Aquifer System Groundwater Availability Model A-26 the well type code (tblLkWellType field well_type_code). Corrected. 149. Bracs Database table HP_GAM_tblWell_Location field [county_name] contains a number of misspelled names: armstron; deaf smi; hutchins; 0; roosevel. Please correct. Corrected. 150. Bracs Database table HP_GAM_tblWell_Location records of wells do not have any well owner , depth, drill date, or corresponding records in the table HP_GAM_tblBracs_ForeignKey from the following sources: DBS&A, 2012; DBS&A, 2013; Hemphill County UWCD, 2013. If there are any attributes of these wells that can be added to Bracs Database to support the identification of these wells, please provide it. For example, wells from the source PGCD, 2013 have a state well number in the foreign key table that will allow identification of additional data. All data that INTERA has is contained within this table. 151. Bracs Database table HP_GAM_tblGeophysicalLog_Header field [gl_digital_file_name] requires the filename without the file extension. Corrected. Draft geodatabase comments to be addressed 152. Please add metadata information to the geodatabase and also provide the spatial reference information.

This feature class is in agreement with the Strategic Mapping Program (StratMap) county Final Conceptual Model Report for the High Plains Aquifer System Groundwater Availability Model A-27 boundaries within Texas. No derivative data dependent on this boundary feature class were created and so further revision was not required. 155. Please consider not using the CONMNETTXStateBoundaries feature class as it too has the same drift issue as the CountyBoundaries feature class (in previous comment). \u201cCONMNETTXStateBoundaries\u201d feature class removed from the geodatabase and replaced with the \u201cState_Boundary_GAM\u201d feature class. This feature class is in agreement with the Strategic Mapping Program (StratMap) county boundaries within Texas. 156. Please revise the metadata to describe why the TWDB_PecosValleyAquifer feature class does not match the \u201cofficial\u201d TWDB boundary for the Pecos Valley Aquifer or correct the TWDB_PecosValleyAquifer feature class and any derivative data that may have been created from this feature class.

The definition of the GAM coordinate system is included in the metadata description added for the geodatabase as a whole, per Comment #151. General suggestions for Draft geodatabase 212. Please consider moving the EvapGrids and EvapGridsSelect feature classes from the SurfaceHydro feature dataset to the Climate feature dataset. Done. 213. Please consider using a raster mosaic data model structure instead of the raster catalog for the (DEM) elevation datasets and/or please consider not using duplicates (DEM raster catalog and GeomorphologyDEM raster catalog) for the elevation datasets to help reduce the size of the geodatabase. Duplicate DEM removed. Official DEM is contained in \u201cGeomorphologyDEM\u201d raster catalog. 214. Please consider using, for each of the raster catalogs within the geodatabase, the same format used for the Contents listing of the raster datasets within the raster catalog in the metadata description to make it easier to correlate between the Contents listing and the metadata description. In other words, please consider listing an individual metadata description for each raster dataset within the raster catalogs that includes both the name and OBJECTID for each raster dataset. Done. Suggestions for Conceptual Model Report: General suggestions 215. Please check for grammar, spelling, and punctuation throughout the report. Final Conceptual Model Report for the High Plains Aquifer System Groundwater Availability Model A-36 Text revised throughout report where needed. 216. Please capitalize Aquifer when discussing one aquifer and please use lower case when referencing more than one. Text revised throughout report where needed. 217. Please consider using the term \u201csubcrop\u201d instead of \u201cdowndip\u201d for aquifers or formations that do not have a regional dip such as the Edwards-Trinity (Plateau) Aquifer. \u201cDowndip\u201d replaced with \u201csubcrop\u201d throughout report, where appropriate. 218. Value range scales on the figures are sized differently and only marked with minimum and maximum values (e.g. Figures 4.2.11A - 4.2.19). Please put more values on the value scale ranges and resize them to be consistent. Value range scales adjusted on figures throughout the report, where appropriate. Specific suggestions 219.

Areas where these studies identify the likelihood of cross- formational flow are in some cases more specifically explained or shown on figures, sometimes must be inferred from figures, but sometimes only general descriptions of the areas are provided. In addition, areas of cross-formational flow are not always consistent between the literature studies.

It appears that areas without recharge also correspond to bands of low precipitation and areas with early recharge breakthroughs are in areas with higher precipitation (or please clarify if this is circular reasoning as the approach used is not clear). The conceptualization is that precipitation is not the major driver for increased recharge, but rather the occurrence of agricultural activity. We don\u2019t see any obvious correlation in breakthrough times with precipitation. If it were true, the most northeastern county should have the earliest breakthrough and get steadily later towards the southwest (since precipitation decreases from northeast to southwest). However, the wettest, most northeastern county (Crosby) actually broke through much more recently (1990\u2019s) than the one just southeast of it (Lynn) which broke through pre-1960. Other counties with similar precipitation values break through at very different times, supporting our conceptualization that recharge depends on factors other than precipitation. 246.
