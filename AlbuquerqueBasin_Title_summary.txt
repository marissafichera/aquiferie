This text repeatedly references multiple studies related to the Albuquerque Basin and its aquifer systems. Several different titles are mentioned—among them:  
• “Mapping Suitability for Managed Aquifer Recharge in the Albuquerque Basin.”  
• “Estimated 2016 Groundwater Level and Drawdown in the Santa Fe Group Aquifer System, Central New Mexico.”  
• “New perspectives on the geometry of the Albuquerque Basin.”  
• “Regional Survey of Structural Properties and Cementation Patterns of Fault Zones in the Northern Part of the Albuquerque Basin, New Mexico—Implications for Ground-Water Flow.”

Much of the text focuses on clarifying which title actually corresponds to a particular document. In doing so, it notes that the precise study title sometimes is not explicitly stated in the shared content. Nonetheless, the overarching theme is geological and hydrological research on the Albuquerque Basin, encompassing managed aquifer recharge, groundwater levels and drawdowns, structural features of the basin, and how these factors affect groundwater flow.
