Therefore it is prudent to analyze the data collected at such great expense with methods that will extract the most useful information. The present work builds on other recent studies and demonstrates that spatiotemporal kriging of water-level data is superior to spatial kriging in this regard.

I N T R O D U C T I O N T he Mimbres Basin watershed and subjacent aquifers are located in Do\u00f1a Ana, Grant, Luna, and Sierra Counties of southwest New Mexico (Figure 1). Major population centers in the basin include Silver City, Hurley, Tyrone, Deming and Columbus. The surface extent of the Mimbres Basin in the United States is shown in Figure 1, and covers about 11,590 km2 (4,475 mi2). The topographic basin is closed and the watershed and aquifer extend south into Mexico. The northern boundary of the surface-water basin coincides with the Continental Divide north and west of Silver City. The Continental Divide also forms the western boundary of the basin and extends south from the Little Burro Mountains almost to the international border. On the east, the basin bound\u00ad ary extends south and east around the Good Sight Mountains and across the West Potrillo Mountains to the international border. The basin boundaries transect a great variety of topographic relief, geologic structures, and rock types (Figures 1 and 2). Agriculture, mining, and ranching form the basis of the regional economy. Groundwater is the major water supply for agricultural, industrial, municipal and domestic uses. Luna County encompasses a large portion of the Mimbres Basin and almost all of the irrigated acreage. Magnuson et al. (2019) estimated that of the 29,880 acres irrigated in Luna County in 2015, 28,480 acres (95%) were irrigated solely with groundwater. Irrigated agriculture and public water supply together accounted for 83,100 acre-feet of groundwater withdrawals in 2015 (Magnuson et al., 2019). Groundwater has been vital to the development of the Mimbres Basin since the early 20th century, and thus its importance has long been recognized. Groundwater development for agriculture began near Deming in 1908 and irrigated acreage and groundwa\u00ad ter use expanded rapidly. Until that time, agriculture was limited to lands near the upper Mimbres River that could be irrigated with surface water (Hawley et al., 2000, and references therein). Water levels in wells across the basin have been measured by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), the New Mexico Office of the State Engineer (NMOSE), the New Mexico Bureau of Geology and Mineral Resources (NMBGMR) and other entities since extensive groundwater development began. The database of water-level data maintained by the Aquifer Mapping Program at the NMBGMR contains measurements from the Mimbres Basin dating back to 1910. Manual measurement of water levels in wells is a crucial task for understanding groundwater resources (Taylor and Alley, 2001), yet it is labor-intensive, time- consuming, and expensive. Figure 3 illustrates that the overall number and frequency of water-level measure\u00ad ments in the Mimbres Basin has declined greatly since 1980. Prior to 2020, the last basin-wide water-level measurement campaign was in 2012, and far fewer measurements were made at that time than in previous field studies. Developing water-table or water-level elevation maps is a major use of water-level measure\u00ad ments."

Developing water-table or water-level elevation maps is a major use of water-level measure\u00ad ments. Such maps convey vital information about an aquifer, such as groundwater flow directions, locations of recharge and discharge, groundwater-surface water interactions, and control of lithology and geologic structure on groundwater occurrence and flow. These maps can be used to infer aquifer hydraulic properties and their spatial variation, and assess the impacts of groundwater pumping on water resources. It is critical to use high-quality data and robust methods to inter\u00ad polate between the locations of field measurements. The geostatistical interpolation method of kriging was originally developed in the mining industry and has a strong theoretical background (Cressie, 2015). It is applied regularly across the gamut of earth and environmental sciences (Webster and Oliver, 2007) and groundwater hydrology in particular (Kitanidis, 1997), including recent studies in New Mexico (Rinehart et al., 2016, Rawling and Rinehart, 2018). Spatiotemporal kriging is an extension of spatial krig\u00ad ing to include the additional dimension of time, and it derives from an equally well-developed theory (Cressie and Wikle, 2011; Gr\u00e4ler et al., 2016; Wikle et al., 2019). It has also seen use in earth and environmental sciences (e.g., Huevelink and Griffith, 2010; Gasch et al., 2015) but only recently have there been applica\u00ad tions to groundwater hydrology (Ruybal et al., 2019; Varouchakis and Hristopulos, 2019).

The first was to characterize current groundwater conditions by again measuring water levels in wells across the Mimbres Basin. The goal was to revisit the wells measured in 2012, as these wells had been measured many times previously and thus new measurements would add to existing water- level time series. The second was to create a series of maps of water levels, and changes in water levels over time, using spatiotemporal geostatistical methods. The data manipulation and computations were performed using the R language (R Core Team, 2018) and the gstat, space, and spacetime packages (Pebesma, 2004; Pebesma, 2012, Bivand et al., 2013). The spatiotem\u00ad poral approach maximizes the amount of information and insight that can be extracted from the new and existing water-level data by quantifying the correla\u00ad tion of the measurements in space and time. This increases the precision and accuracy of the derived water-level maps. The method allows estimates to be made of water levels at times when there are no data, and in places where there are no data, and provides estimates of the uncertainty in both cases. Figure 3.

They also contain reference lists of older and/or larger scale mapping that was used in the geologic compilations. More recent work includes the important study of Heywood (2002), who interpreted the thickness of alluvial fill and depth to bedrock in the Mimbres Basin using isostatic residual gravity anomalies. The earliest groundwater studies in the Mimbres Basin were the work of Darton (1914, 1916). Other historical regional-scale groundwater studies include White (1931), Theis (1939), Conover and Akin (1942), and Trauger (1972). McLean (1977) sum\u00ad marized existing hydrologic data and conditions in the mid-1970s and Hawley et al. (2000) contains a detailed and thorough summary of the geology and hydrogeology of southwestern New Mexico, includ\u00ad ing an exhaustive reference list. Kennedy et al. (2000) is an overview of the main conclusions of the Hawley et al. (2000) study. Numerous unpublished reports by consultants have discussed issues such as regional water plan\u00ad ning and estimates of current and future supply and demand (e.g., D.B. Stephens and Associates, 2009, for the Deming region), and numerical groundwater flow models developed to address particular hydrologic questions (e.g., Romero and Cook, 2009, managed aquifer recharge near Silver City). Hanson et al. (1994) described the hydrogeologic framework of the basin and a preliminary two-dimensional numerical groundwater flow model. Finch et al. (2008) describe a more detailed three-dimensional flow model originally developed for the Chino Mines Company. The flow model currently used by the NMOSE to administer and manage water rights in the Mimbres Basin is described by Cuddy and Keyes (2011). A notable consequence of ongoing groundwater pumping in the Mimbres Basin is land subsidence and the formation of earth fissures. Galloway et al. (1999) provide a review of the mechanisms and consequences of land subsidence due to extraction of groundwater. Contaldo and Mueller (1991) and Haneberg and Friesen (1995) described land subsidence and mea\u00ad sured fissure formation in the Mimbres Basin. Regional Geology Simplified geology of the Mimbres Basin is shown on Figure 2. This overview is largely based on sources cited in the \u201cPrevious Work\u201d section, Clemons and Mack (1988), and New Mexico Bureau of Geology and Mineral Resources (2003). The landscape is characterized by steep and rugged fault-block mountains at the basin margins that bound wide desert plains formed on the intervening structurally down-dropped valleys. This landscape has resulted from middle Miocene to late Pleistocene extensional block faulting (Clemons and Mack, 1988). The Florida, Tres Hermanas, and Victorio Mountains, and numerous smaller prominences, are intrabasin mountains surrounded by broad, low-relief pediments and bajadas (Figure 1). The regional geology is quite complex, as the Mimbres Basin lies at the intersection of three distinct geologic/tectonic provinces\u2014the southern Colorado Plateau, the Basin and Range, and the Rio Grande rift (Hanson et al., 1994). The bedrock in the mountains range from Proterozoic to Cenozoic in age. Proterozoic rocks are dominantly granite with minor syenite, gneiss, and schist, and are abundant in the Big Burro Mountains. Lower Paleozoic intrusive igneous rocks are present in I I . B A C K G R O U N D 7 W A T E R - L E V E L T R E N D S I N T H E M I M B R E S B A S I N , S O U T H W E S T N E W M E X I C O the Florida Mountains. Paleozoic sedimentary rocks range from Cambrian to Permian in age. They are dominated by limestone and dolomite, with subor\u00ad dinate sandstone, shale and siltstone, and claystone redbeds. These units are found in the Florida Mountains, Tres Hermanas Mountains, Cookes Range, and the Pinos Altos Range. Mesozoic rocks consist of Cretaceous sandstone and shale in scattered exposures in Cookes Range, the Tres Hermanas Mountains, and Pinos Altos Range. Lower Paleozoic intrusive igneous rocks are present in the Florida Mountains. Mesozoic rocks consist of Cretaceous sandstone and shale in scattered exposures in Cookes Range, the Tres Hermanas Mountains, and Pinos Altos Range. Tertiary sedimentary, volcaniclastic, and intrusive and extrusive igneous rocks are widespread in all of the mountains. Quaternary basalt flows com\u00ad prise the volcanic field of the West Potrillo Mountains at the southeast margin of the area. The sedimentary basins underlying the valleys are filled with Cenozoic sedimentary rocks, with lesser amounts of volcaniclastic and volcanic rocks. These units host the aquifer system that is the focus of this study. The depth to bedrock in the basins varies widely (see below), and the thickness of the sedi\u00ad mentary fill varies accordingly (Hanson et al., 1994; Seager, 1995; Hawley et al., 2000). As summarized by Hawley et al. (2000), regionally a distinction can be made between an upper, poorly consolidated basin-fill sedimentary unit with thickness ranging from 100 to 300 m (330 to 990 ft), and a lower, usually more indurated unit composed of conglomerate, sandstone, and mudstone as much as 1,000 m (3,280 ft) thick. The lower unit is often identified as, or correlated with, the well-indurated Gila Conglomerate and/or Gila Group, which is widely exposed at the northern margins of the Mimbres Basin area and in the moun\u00ad tains to the north. The majority of the wells in this study are completed in the upper unit, or the upper\u00ad most part of the lower unit.

        "Text": "sandstone and shale in scattered exposures in Cookes Range, the Tres Hermanas Mountains, and Pinos Altos Range. Lower Paleozoic intrusive igneous rocks are present in the Florida Mountains. Mesozoic rocks consist of Cretaceous sandstone and shale in scattered exposures in Cookes Range, the Tres Hermanas Mountains, and Pinos Altos Range. Tertiary sedimentary, volcaniclastic, and intrusive and extrusive igneous rocks are widespread in all of the mountains. Quaternary basalt flows com\u00ad prise the volcanic field of the West Potrillo Mountains at the southeast margin of the area. The sedimentary basins underlying the valleys are filled with Cenozoic sedimentary rocks, with lesser amounts of volcaniclastic and volcanic rocks. These units host the aquifer system that is the focus of this study. The depth to bedrock in the basins varies widely (see below), and the thickness of the sedi\u00ad mentary fill varies accordingly (Hanson et al., 1994; Seager, 1995; Hawley et al., 2000). As summarized by Hawley et al. (2000), regionally a distinction can be made between an upper, poorly consolidated basin-fill sedimentary unit with thickness ranging from 100 to 300 m (330 to 990 ft), and a lower, usually more indurated unit composed of conglomerate, sandstone, and mudstone as much as 1,000 m (3,280 ft) thick. The lower unit is often identified as, or correlated with, the well-indurated Gila Conglomerate and/or Gila Group, which is widely exposed at the northern margins of the Mimbres Basin area and in the moun\u00ad tains to the north. The majority of the wells in this study are completed in the upper unit, or the upper\u00ad most part of the lower unit. The near-surface deposits in the Mimbres Basin are Upper Quaternary in age and were deposited by the Mimbres River and San Vicente Arroyo drainage systems (Seager, 1995; Love and Seager, 1996). These unconsolidated deposits can have saturated thicknesses up to 30 m (100ft). Hawley et al. (2000) proposed a conceptual framework of subdividing the basin fill into hydro\u00ad stratigraphic units characterized by distinct lithofacies associations. This scheme relates depositional envi\u00ad ronment (e.g., alluvial fan, braided stream channel, basin-floor playa) to sediment textural characteristics, bedding thickness, spatial geometry, and con\u00ad nectivity, and ultimately hydraulic conductivity and groundwater production potential. Although geologi\u00ad cally and hydrologically sound, in practice, these classifications cannot be mapped except in a very general way in the subsurface in the Mimbres Basin due in part to a lack of borehole geophysical data (Hawley et al., 2000; see plate 1 therein). The dif\u00ad ficulty of correlating individual beds of gravel, sand, silt, and clay using lithologic logs or cuttings was noted even in the earliest studies in the basin (Darton, 1916; Contaldo and Meuller, 1991). The subsurface geometry and geologic structure of the Mimbres Basin consists of numerous sub\u00ad basins with great variations in thickness of the basin- fill units. Several workers prior to Heywood (2002) presented structural-tectonic maps and cross sections of the region with various names for the subbasins, their mapped or inferred extents, depth estimates from limited well, gravity and seismic data, and mapped or inferred geometries of bounding faults (e.g., Wilkins, 1986, Hanson et al., 1994, Seager, 1995; Hawley et al., 2000). The gravity study of Heywood (2002) clarified the subsurface geometry of the basins and clearly identified their shallow and deep portions (Heywood, 2002, Fig. 4; also repro\u00ad duced as contours in Finch et al., 2008, Fig. 1). Great thicknesses of basin fill exist northeast of Deming, and along the northwest-southeast trend of San Vicente Arroyo and the lower Mimbres River (Figure 2). This area corresponds to the Mangas Trench of Hanson et al. (1994), also referred to as the San Vicente Subbasin by Hawley et al. (2000). The northwest-southeast region of thick basin fill west and southwest of the Florida Mountains corresponds to the Seventy-Six basin of Hanson et al. (1994), also referred to as the southern Deming Subbasin by Hawley et al. (2000). The Florida graben or subbasin east of Cookes Range and the Florida Mountains contains three areas of thick basin fill separated by saddles of shallower bedrock. Large areas of the Mimbres Basin have total basin-fill thickness of less than 100 m (330 ft). The cross sections of Seager et al. (1982) and Seager (1995) show that almost everywhere in the central and southern Mimbres basin, the basin fill sedimentary units overlie middle to lower Tertiary volcanic rocks. This is also seen in the oil-test wells east and northwest of Deming studied by Clemons (1986). Hawley et al. (2000) notes that the upper Mimbres River drainage and a region east of the Tres Hermanas Mountains in the southern Florida subbasin/graben are the only areas in the Mimbres Basin where these pre-Gila Group volcanic rocks are important parts of the aquifer system.

(2008) discuss the surface and groundwater hydrology of the Mimbres Basin in detail. The Mimbres River usually has perennial flow from its headwaters to the vicinity of the Grant \u2013 Luna county line. Flood flows during spring snowmelt or exceptional rainfall events often extend further south to near Black Mountain northwest of Deming and very rarely to Deming itself (Figure 1). Infiltration of Mimbres River water is a main source of recharge to the Mimbres Basin aquifer (Hawley et al., 2000). Small amounts of perennial flow occur in upstream reaches of San Vicente Arroyo from urban irriga\u00ad tion and leakage in Silver City and treated effluent discharge from the sewage treatment plant. This water infiltrates upstream of the confluence with the Mimbres River. Flood flows in the normally dry drainages (e.g., Cow Springs Draw, Seventy-Six Draw, Macho Draw) extending from the basin bounding mountains contribute small amounts of recharge. Groundwater in the Mason Draw drainage in the northeast part of the Mimbres Basin has been shown to discharge to the Mesilla Basin to the east (Hawley et al., 2000). Estimates of total recharge vary but all agree that it is only a few percent of the annual total precipitation over the basin. Potential evapotranspiration is very high and areal recharge across the basin floors is negligible. Most recharge comes from infiltration of Mimbres River water and mountain front recharge (Wilson and Guan, 2004) along the northern margins of the basin. Little or no recharge is derived from the highlands south of Deming, except perhaps the largest few watersheds. Hanson et al. (1994) developed a water budget and estimated total recharge to the United States portion of the Mimbres Basin at about 52,000 acre-feet per year. Their two-dimensional groundwater model suggested this was too high, and that a value of about 55% of this, or about 29,000 acre-feet was more reasonable. The smaller value is in agreement with results from calibra\u00ad tion of the more elaborate model of Finch et al. (2008), who estimated total recharge at 29,050 acre-feet per year. Finch et al. (2008) did not specify whether their"

The smaller value is in agreement with results from calibra\u00ad tion of the more elaborate model of Finch et al. (2008), who estimated total recharge at 29,050 acre-feet per year. Finch et al. (2008) did not specify whether their results were for the whole basin or just the portion in the United States. These numbers are about one third of the estimated groundwater withdrawals in Luna County in 2015 (83,100 acre-feet; Magnusson et al., 2019). Groundwater pumping and evapotranspiration from playas are the main discharges. The latter has largely been replaced by the former since large scale groundwa\u00ad ter pumping began (Hawley et al., 2000). Groundwater flow is generally south and southeast from the northern highlands to the international border, with progressively decreasing gradient. Gradients and flow directions are highly perturbed from pre-development conditions in areas with large water-level declines due to pumping. South and southeast of Columbus, flow directions have completely reversed, and groundwater flows north into the United States. Finch et al. (2008) subdivided the Mimbres Basin into four major hydrogeologic regions based on patterns of recharge and discharge, and large scale hydrogeologic properties determined by the geologic structure such as the depth to bedrock in the basins (Figure 4). Darton (1916) noted water-bearing zones of 1.5 to 12 m (5 to 40 ft) in thickness and highly variable lateral continuity. Darton (1916) and White (1931) described the Mimbres Basin aquifer as overall phreatic or unconfined, with local zones of partial confinement and subartesian conditions, the latter indicating water levels that rise in wells above the water-bearing zone, but not flowing at the surface. Hawley et al. (2000) noted that the upper 100 m (330 ft) of the Mimbres basin aquifer \u201cat many localities\u201d contains fine-grained material such as playa-lake beds and/or is partly indurated, suggesting potential for local confined or partially confined conditions. Almost all of the wells in this study are located in outcrop areas of basin-fill sediment or Gila Group (Figure 4) and are assumed to be completed in these units. Many irrigation wells have multiple screens and likely tap more than one water bearing zone. Water levels do not show distinct trends with depth of wells. It is assumed that the water levels analyzed here are derived from one complex but continuous, regional, unconfined aquifer system. 9 W A T E R - L E V E L T R E N D S I N T H E M I M B R E S B A S I N , S O U T H W E S T N E W M E X I C O Figure 4.

The field notes and records of this work were obtained from the NMOSE with the goal of revisiting all of the wells for additional measure\u00ad ments in late winter 2020. In 2012, 158 wells were measured, in January and February 2020, 107 wells were measured. We could not measure numerous wells for various reasons, including collapse of the well, denial of permission by the owner, locked gates, muddy and impassable roads, and flooded crossings of the Mimbres River. Water levels were measured with a steel tape or an electric water-level sounder if the well was unequipped. At least two depth-to-water measurements were made at each well to attempt repeatability within 0.02 ft (0.6 cm). Well locations were recorded with a handheld GPS unit. In addition to the 2012 and 2020 data, well locations and water levels for all wells in the Mimbres Basin were obtained from the NMBGMR Aquifer Mapping program database. This database contains all readily available water-level data from the USGS, NMOSE, and NMBGMR for the Mimbres Basin since 1910. These data were filtered and processed in the following ways: 1. Only wells with water-level measurements since 1980 were considered, and only data since 1980 were included in this study. 2. Hydrographs for each well were viewed in an interactive script, where all measurements during the normal irrigation season, March through October inclusive, were removed. The exception was year 2012, in which there were many mea\u00ad surements in March. These were kept unless there was an obvious irrigation signal. 3. Measurements with a USGS data quality flag were removed. A data flag indicates measurement issues, such as the water-level recovering from pumping, or adjacent wells were being pumped at the time of the measurement. 4. Any other measurements that appeared to be significant outliers were removed, based on interactive inspection of the hydrographs. 5. All well locations were projected from UTM coordinates to Lambert Conformal Conic projec\u00ad tion. This was done because the boundary of UTM zones 12 and 13 passes though the study area, resulting in well locations in two different projections, and in some cases wells in UTM zone 12 were recorded with UTM zone 13 coordinates. These were converted to UTM zone 12 before projection to Lambert Conformal Conic. 6. The land surface elevation at each well was determined from a 4.5 meter (15 ft) lateral resolu\u00ad tion digital elevation model, and the water-level elevation was then determined from the depth-to- water measurements. Water-level data are recorded and used by regula\u00ad tory and management agencies in New Mexico in English units (feet, for depth to water and water-level elevation), whereas location and elevation data for wells may be recorded in English units, metric units, or both. In this study all data were converted to metric units prior to the analyses. Intermediate results of analyses are presented here in metric units. Final results such as water-level elevations and their changes, and estimates of uncertainty, were converted to feet after the analyses"

Water-level data and well information retained after the filtering and processing described above are presented in Appendix 4. Water-level Analysis Elevations in the Mimbres Basin range from 3,099 m (10,170 feet) in the Black Range to 1,207 m (3,959 ft) along the international border southeast of Columbus, with a strong north to south regional topographic gradient (Figure 1). Thus, there is similarly strong regional gradient in water-level eleva\u00ad tions. This is a regional water-level trend that must be accounted for when modelling the water-level surface. I I I .

(1) where m(s,t) is a deterministic trend and \u025b(s,t) is the stochastic, or random, residual with a normal distribution and zero mean. The trend may be a function of space and time as shown, of space or time alone, or a constant value. Here it is assumed to be constant in time; i.e., m(s). This is the \u201cregression\u201d in spatiotemporal regression kriging. It can be thought of as the long-term baseline pattern of water levels and their variation across the region that is controlled by factors that are essentially constant in time but variable in space on a large scale; e.g., land-surface elevation, broad patterns of subsurface geology, long- term natural patterns of recharge and discharge, etc. Deviations from this trend are the residuals and they account for the local geometry of water levels and how they change with smaller scale spatial patterns of discharge, recharge, and variations of these processes in time. Quantifying and modelling the correlation of the residuals in space and time is what is investigated in the \u201cspatiotemporal kriging\u201d part of spatiotempo\u00ad ral regression kriging. Regional Trend In many geologic situations, the water-table elevation of an unconfined aquifer is a subdued replica of the land surface topography (King, 1899; T\u00f3th, 1963; Desbarats et al., 2002). This suggests a model of the regional water-level trend in the Mimbres Basin as a function of geographic coordinates and elevation. The mathematical form of such a model is subjective and nonunique (Huevelink and Griffith, 2010), but ideally it is physically reasonable and explains the large scale variation. Importantly, the residuals from the model (the differences of the data values from the trend model predictions) should be normally distributed, have zero mean, and exhibit stationarity (Webster and Oliver, 2007; Hengl, 2009). The first two conditions indicate that, when all of the data are considered, the trend model does not tend to over- or under-predict the water levels. Stationarity means that the statistics of the residuals do not show spatial trends. Specifically the mean should be constant and the covariance or correlation of the residuals at any pair of points should only depend on their separation, and not their absolute position (Webster and Oliver, 2007). Rawling and Rinehart (2018) modelled the regional trend of water levels in the High Plains Aquifer in eastern New Mexico using a third-order polynomial function of the easting and northing coor\u00ad dinates of the wells. This approach was not successful in the Mimbres Basin, as residuals from polynomial functions of the geographic well coordinates are dis\u00ad tinctly bimodal, have non-zero mean and are skewed. Experimental spatial variograms calculated from these residuals did not reach a constant sill, but rather showed continuous increase with increasing spatial lag, indicating non-stationarity (Webster and Oliver, 2007; variograms are discussed in the next section). Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was used to find a better predictor for the regional water- level trend. PCA is a technique for reducing the dimensionality of datasets while minimizing loss of information (Abdi and Williams, 2010; Jolliffe and Cadima, 2016). It creates new, uncorrelated, variables from a dataset under the constraint of maximizing the variance explained by the new variables. The new variables are called the principal components and are linear combinations of the original data, here, the easting, northing, and land-surface elevation coordi\u00ad nates for each well location (in meters). The principal components are completely defined by the structure of the original data, and the solution is unique apart from the sign, which is arbitrary (Jolliffe and Cadima, 2016). The first two principal components together explain 96% of the variation in the three-dimensional coordinates of the wells (Figure 5; Table 1 and Appendix 1), effectively reducing the well locations to a two-dimensional space. All three spatial coordinates contribute to all three of the principal components (Table 1; each coordinate is multiplied by the load\u00ad ing and these are summed to create the principal component).

The principal components are derived from the east coordinate, north coordinate, and land surface elevation of each well.

This trend is constant in time; for most of the wells there are multiple water-level measurements, so the trend is fit to all of the measurements at each well, regardless of the date of measurement. In Figure 5c, the loadings of the well coordinates (Table 1) were used to cal\u00ad culate the water-level trend prediction at each point of a 1,000 m square grid spanning the study area, where elevations for each grid point were determined from a 4.5 m digital elevation model. Note that the regional trend and subsequent spatiotemporal kriging analysis was not extended to the northern terminus of the basin due to the lack of data in this region. More details of the regional trend are presented in Appendix 1. Figures 6 and 7 show the residuals from the regional trend fit to the data. Two criteria were combined to identify data points that were not fit, or predicted, adequately by the polynomial trend function. Data points with standardized residuals that are greater than two standard deviations from zero are often considered outliers (Schuenemeyer and Drew, 2011). One can also calculate Cook\u2019s Distance, which is an iterative process wherein the parameters of the fitted model are recalculated by dropping each data point in turn and using only the remaining data to fit the model. One common criteria for a high value of Cook\u2019s Distance is any value greater than 4/n, 0.0012 in this study, where n is the number of data (Glen, 2020). Any water-level measurements that satisfied both of these criteria were flagged as outliers. These water-level measurements were then dropped from further analysis, and were not used in the spatiotemporal kriging. Well NM-05236 (one measurement) was also dropped. The standardized residual for this measurement was 3.08 and Cook\u2019s distance was 0.011. However, it clearly plots amongst the other outlier measurements in Figure 6b. Wells with outlier measurements are shown as yellow circles in Figure 4. Outlier measurements are shown in red in Figures 6b and c. Figure 7 shows the statistics and the spatial distribution of the residuals with the outlier measurements removed. One could repeat the above procedure of identify\u00ad ing outliers indefinitely, by repeatedly refitting the regional trend model and identifying and removing outliers using the same combined criteria as above. However, there is no definite end to this process and no reason to think that a deterministic trend will ever adequately represent all of the data. Most of the outlier data points are on the margins of the study region, in geologically and topographically distinct 13 W A T E R - L E V E L T R E N D S I N T H E M I M B R E S B A S I N , S O U T H W E S T N E W M E X I C O areas, where it is plausible that a regional model may not represent extreme, local conditions. In addition, a polynomial trend model will tend to perform worse on the margins of the region, where data is often sparse, and it will be overly influenced by regions of extreme variation (Webster and Oliver, 2007). The outliers are addressed further in the discussion. Both with and without the outlier points, the residuals from the polynomial trend model form a minimally skewed, approximately normal distribution with near zero mean (Figures 6a and 7a respectively). Spatially, they tend to cluster in groups of mostly positive and negative values, but many areas have a mix of both, and there is no regional trend (e.g., all positive values in the south, all negative values in the north) (Figure 6d and 7d). The positive and negative clusters result in the double peak in the histogram (Figure 7a) but the Q-Q plot (Figure 7b) shows that the distribution of residuals after removal of outliers is very nearly normal. Sample and Fitted Variograms The residuals from the regional trend model are the differences of each water-level elevation measurement from the time-invariant trend model prediction at that point. The spatial and temporal correlation of these residuals are investigated by calculating the sample spatiotemporal variogram. The variogram is then modelled with a mathematical function.

The sum-metric model was chosen based on 1) its superior fit based on the optim and MSE param\u00ad eters generated by the numerical optimization scheme used by R to fit the model parameters to the sample variogram, and 2) comparison of \u201cleave-one-out\u201d cross-validation statistics and spatial patterns of cross- validation residuals generated for each model in turn (Cressie and Wikle, 2011; see Appendix 2 for details). Cross-validation involves removing each data point in turn and predicting the value at that location (and time in the spatiotemporal case) using the remaining data. It is a measure of the strength of the model and how well it can reproduce the actual data. where h is the spatial separation, or lag, u is the time separation, or lag, and N(u,h) is the number of paired residuals separated by spatiotemporal lag (h,u) (Heuvelink and Griffith, 2010; Ruybal et al., 2019). The variogram value, gamma, is thus the average squared difference in residuals at each combination of spatial and temporal lag. Because the data points are not regularly arranged in space or time, the data are grouped into bins of spatial and temporal lags. The result is a three-dimensional variogram surface describing the correlation of the residuals in space and time (Figure 8). The sample spatiotemporal variogram was fitted with a sum-metric variogram model (Snepvangers et al., 2003; Gr\u00e4ler et al., 2016).

The nugget variance is present in all three components, but has different magnitudes for each, and is the sum of spatio-temporal variation in the data at ranges smaller than the smallest lag distance and measurement errors (Cressie and Wikle, 2011). The sum-metric model is the sum of separate spatial, temporal, and joint spatio-temporal variogram compo\u00ad nents. The joint component is a metric variogram, where \u03ba is the space-time anisotropy ratio (space/time) that relates spatial and temporal distances into a single space-time distance (Kyriakidis and Journal, 1999; Snepvan\u00ad gers et al., 2003). \u03ba less than one means that, for example, the correlation at 1 m distance equals the correlation at 5 days time, and vice-versa if the anisotropy is greater than one (Gasch et al., 2015). The best fitting sum-metric model is shown in Figure 8 and is given by: The general formula for the sum-metric spatiotemporal variogram model is Circular and exponential (exp) variogram models are two of a limited group of functions used in geostatistics to model variograms because they possess mathematical properties necessary for the kriging equations to be solvable (Webster and Oliver, 2007). Note that the temporal component \u200b\u200b\u03b3\u200b T\u200b(u)\u200b \u200bis a pure nugget variogram; all of the spatiotemporal correlation is accounted for in the joint component. The structure of the sample and fitted spatio- temporal variograms in Figure 8 suggests why the space-time approach is appealing for prediction of water levels in the Mimbres Basin. In the spatial domain, the variogram rises rapidly to a well-defined sill value (\u200b\u200b\u03c3\u200b S\u200b 2\u200b + \u200b\u03c3\u200b nS\u200b 2 \u200b\u200b) of about 145 m2, which is the \u201cglobal\u201d variance of the residuals of the water level data.

This sill is reached at a range of 15,380 m. This means that pairs of data points (wells) separated by a distance, or lag, larger than this are essentially uncorrelated, and a measurement at one provides no information about the water level at the other. At lags less than 15,380 m, the residuals of the water-level data are progressively more strongly correlated as the lags decrease. In the time domain, the variogram rises very slowly, indicating strong temporal correlation of water levels to the largest temporal lags of nearly 22 years. The fluctuations, or cyclicity, about the sill value of the sample variogram reflect the distribution of positive and negative trend residuals in space. Several patterns visible in the maps of residuals (Figures 6 and 7) show up in the sample variogram (Prycz and Deutsch, 2003). 1. The lag distance of the first peak reflects the average spatial extent of the positive and negative groups, about 15,380 m. 2. The lag distance at the first trough is the sum of the average extent of the groups and the average distance between the groups, about 20,000 m. 3.

Sample spatiotemporal variogram of regional trend residuals and fitted sum-metric model. In simple kriging the mean is known and constant and is an input to the kriging algorithm. In ordinary kriging the mean of the data is estimated from the data, rather than assumed constant and/or known beforehand. Prycz and Deutsch (2003) note that the type of correlation structure described above violates the assumption of strong global stationarity inherent in simple kriging and that ordinary kriging is more appropriate to use. Ordinary spatiotemporal kriging was used in this study. The penalty for estimating the mean (ordinary kriging) rather than specifying a known mean (simple kriging) is higher kriging variance (Cressie, 2015). The Mimbres Basin covers over 10,000 km2, and is geologically and topographically diverse, with a variety of land uses. These facts also bear on the issue of stationarity: is it appropriate to use a single sample variogram and fitted model, or \u201cglobal\u201d model, to describe the correlation structure of the water-level data across the entire region? Even with the fluctua\u00ad tions just described, the sample variogram does have a well-defined sill that reaches a plateau value and does not continually increase. Beyond the range value of 15,380 m, the residuals have essentially constant vari\u00ad ance upon which the local fluctuations in the residuals are superimposed. (Figure 8 and Appendix 2). To further explore this issue, the data were subsetted into the San Vicente, Deming, and Florida hydrogeologic regions identified by Finch et al. (2008, Figure 4), with overlap of 5 km along the boundaries. The Upper Mimbres region was not investigated due to the paucity of data. Sample spatiotemporal variograms were calculated for each region and a best fitting model was chosen using the same opti\u00ad mization criteria described above. Cross-validation statistics and spatial patterns of cross-validation residuals were compared for the wells in each region using the region-specific model, and the \u201cglobal\u201d model (Appendix 3). In all cases the \u201cglobal\u201d model performed as well or better than any of the region- specific models, and so only it was used in further analyses. Spatiotemporal Kriging Once the spatiotemporal variogram model has been chosen, it is straightforward to implement spatio\u00ad temporal kriging at the time periods of interest. An important user-specified parameter in spatiotemporal kriging is nmax, the maximum number of nearest (in the sense of most highly correlated) data points to use in calculating the prediction at any given spacetime point. This value was set to a neighborhood of 50. Increasing this number greatly increases processing time and resulted in poorer, not better predictions. Using a local neighborhood in kriging also relaxes strict stationarity assumptions, and smooth variations in the mean, as are seen here, can be accommodated (Gr\u00e4ler et al, 2016). 17 W A T E R - L E V E L T R E N D S I N T H E M I M B R E S B A S I N , S O U T H W E S T N E W M E X I C O spatial 2012 spatiotemporal 2012 spatial 2020 spatiotemporal 2020 Mean -0.059 0.45 0.37 -0.019 Mean squared error 110.92 18.49 119.84 40.28 Mean squared normalized error 1.16 0.99 1.57 0.99 Correlation between observed and predicted 0.55 0.94 0.61 0.88 Correlation between predicted and residual -0.034 -0.011 -0.13 0.021 Variance of residuals 111.86 18.44 120.99 40.71 Standard deviation of residuals 10.58 4.29 10.99 6.38 Skewness 0.51 -0.47 0.79 -3.06 Minimum of residuals -30.16 -21.81 -24.73 -40.10 Maximum of residuals 42.12 15.40 47.09 15.26 Table 2.

Cross-validation statistics for comparison of spatial and spatiotemporal kriging. Better values are in bold. Results were calculated for late winter at five-year intervals from 1980 to 2020. The water level eleva\u00ad tion is the sum of the trend function prediction at each point (which is constant through time) and the predicted residual from the spatiotemporal kriging calculation, which is unique to each prediction time, or instance (Figure 9). Flow direction vectors were calculated from the predicted water-level surface for each time instance. (Figure 10). Higher resolution maps were prepared for the Deming \u2013 Columbus region, where the majority of the irrigated agriculture is located. (Figure 11). These maps utilize the same data with the same 1 km spatial resolution as those in Figure 9. Kriging, whether spatial or spatiotem\u00ad poral, provides an estimate of the variance of the predictions, and thus the uncertainty in the results is quantified. Figure 12a shows the standard error (the square root of the variance; this has the same units as the original measurements) of the regional trend prediction, and the standard error from the spatiotemporal kriging for each instance (Figure 12b). The total variance is the sum of the variance of the trend surface prediction and kriging variance (Cressie, 2015; Cressie and Wikle 2011; Hengl et al., 2007, Ruybal et al., 2019). The former is constant and the latter changes for each instance. Both vary in space. The total prediction standard error is the square root of the total prediction variance (Cressie and Wikle, 2011). The changes in water levels over each five-year time period are shown in Figure 13, with the net water-level change over the 1980\u20132020 period shown in Figure 14. Hydrographs from example wells are shown in Figure 15 with field measurements and predicted values, and the 95% confidence intervals about the predictions. Several of the aforementioned figures have an overlay of gray polygons to indicate the areas of lithified Cenozoic sedimentary rocks and older bedrock. Very few wells are completed in these regions so the interpolations and predictions there are deemphasized. Comparison of Spatial and Spatiotemporal Kriging The improvement in predictive ability gained by the use of spatio-temporal kriging versus spatial kriging can be demonstrated with the prediction standard error and via cross-validation. Figures 16 through 20 compare the results of the two methods for the years 2012 and 2020, the last two years with abundant water-level measurements. Statistics of the cross- validation results for the two methods are presented in Table 2. The predicted water-level elevation maps are very similar in gross appearance at the scale of the whole basin and it is difficult to see differences in the results from the two methods (Figure 16). Differences are more obvious in the maps of water-level change between 2012 and 2020 (Figure 17). Spatial kriging predicts much larger water-level changes, of up to 150 feet. These values are unreasonably large for an eight- year interval, even in areas of intensive irrigation. The largest changes are very localized, creating an irregu\u00ad lar yet very smooth map appearance of closed highs and lows, and some changes are poorly constrained by data, such as between Whitewater and Faywood and southeast of Akela. The different well networks for the two time-periods may be contributing to this effect. Ruybal et al. (2019) showed that changing well networks though time is a major source of uncer\u00ad tainty when comparing spatial kriging maps made at N E W M E X I C O B U R E A U O F G E O L O G Y A N D M I N E R A L R E S O U R C E S : O F R 6 1 6 18 different times. The water-level changes predicted by spatiotemporal kriging are more reflective of natural variability, of much lower magnitude, and the areas of largest change coincide with wells, which are the loca\u00ad tions with the highest reliability of prediction (lowest standard error, Figures 12 and 18). The prediction standard error for the spatial-only kriging case rises rapidly away from the wells, which form \u201cbulls-eyes\u201d of accuracy, to the maximum value of about 40 to 50 feet, while overall the uncertainty is large (Figure 18a and c). The prediction standard error for the spatiotemporal kriging case shows large regions of low values (high precision), 20 to 30 feet or less (Figure 18b and d). This occurs in many areas where there were no measurements in 2012 and 2020, showing the beneficial influence of measurements at other times on the predictions. The high correlation of water-levels in time improves the precision at times when there are no data \u2013 overall the areas of relatively low standard error are much larger when using spatiotemporal kriging. The standard error contributed by the regional trend model is not shown on the maps in Figure 18. It is the same for both the spatial and spatiotemporal kriging cases and is added to the standard error from kriging to result in the total standard error of prediction (see Figures 12a and 15). Recall that the trend surface was calculated using all of the data from 1980 \u2013 2020, and was assumed to be constant in time. However, one could calculate a trend surface for 2012 and 2020 each, using only the data available for those two years. The fewer available data would result in more uncertainty in the trend surface, and a larger total"

However, one could calculate a trend surface for 2012 and 2020 each, using only the data available for those two years. The fewer available data would result in more uncertainty in the trend surface, and a larger total variance of the prediction for either year. The use of data through time improves both aspects of the water level prediction, the trend surface and the kriging results. Cross-validation histograms and scatterplots show the clear improvement of spatiotemporal kriging over spatial kriging alone (Figures 19 and 20). The latter shows significant bias, under-predicting the high values and over predicting the low values (Figures 19a and 20a). The spatiotemporal cross- validation results more closely follow the 1-to-1 line and show less spread about that line (Figures 19c and 20c). Similar results were observed by Ruybal et al. (2019). Histograms of the cross-validation residuals show a narrower peak and less overall spread (Figures 19b and d, Figures 20b and d). The cross-validation statistics also confirm the improvement in prediction using spatiotemporal methods (Table 2).

This criteria resulted in 144 of 3,376 water-level measurements being classified as outliers, which are shown in Figures 4 and 6. Most of the outlier data are from wells near the perimeter of the study area, and 21 of the 46 wells are located in older lithified Cenozoic sedimentary units, or older bedrock, rather than basin-fill sediments. It is likely these well are not completed in basin-fill sediments. Many of the outlier data are clearly off of the regional trends of water-level elevation vs. land surface elevation and northing (Figure 21). Three wells south of Tyrone are located in bedrock, are 340 to 555 feet deep and plot below the regional water-level versus land-surface trend. They are likely completed in a fractured bedrock aquifer (Figure 21a). Seven wells south of Tyrone in the southeastern Big Burro Mountains are less than 100 feet deep and have water levels above the regional water-level vs. northing trend. They are also likely completed in fractured bedrock and/or a local perched aquifer (Figure 21b). Four wells northwest of Hermanas and one in the Tres Hermanas Mountains are located in or near bedrock uplands and plot above the regional water-level elevation vs. northing trend. These are likely completed in fractured bedrock or local perched aquifers (Figure 21c). Six wells between Cooke\u2019s Range and the Goodsight Mountains are completed in basin fill but have water-levels below the regional water-level elevation vs. northing trend (Figure 21d). However, overall, the third-order polynomial function of the first two principal components of easting, northing, and elevation adequately describes the regional water-level trend for the majority of the wells completed in basin fill. Water-level Maps and Patterns of Water- level Change It is very important when interpreting the water-level maps and changes in water-levels over time to consider the patterns of kriging variance (or standard error as shown here), as lower values indicates increased reliability of the predictions (Figure 12). The spatial patterns of standard error reflect the spatial well density and the number of measurements at each well; values are lowest (precision is highest) in areas with many wells and many measurements over time, and vice- versa. The regional pattern of water-level elevations across the whole Mimbres Basin appears to change little over the time period of the study, 1980 to 2020 (Figure 9). The flow direction vectors indicate regional flow to the south and southeast away from recharge areas in the mountains in the northern part of the basin (Figure 10). Closed depressions in the water table surface are evident as areas of converging vectors representing anthropogenic discharge though groundwater pumping south of Deming and east of Columbus. Water-level declines are notable in the region from Deming south to Columbus when viewed at larger scale (Figure 11). The maps of water-level change over the eight five-year periods reveal large spatial and temporal variations (Figure 13), which are summed in the net water-level change map (Figure 14). Many of these changes can be related to patterns of land use and groundwater recharge and discharge. Net water-level declines of up to 80 feet dominate the region from Deming south to Columbus and Hermanas (Figure 14). These are due to groundwater pumping for irrigated agriculture.

Many of these changes can be related to patterns of land use and groundwater recharge and discharge. Net water-level declines of up to 80 feet dominate the region from Deming south to Columbus and Hermanas (Figure 14). These are due to groundwater pumping for irrigated agriculture. The focused water-level maps (Figure 11) and individual change maps (Figure 13) show how the loci in space and time of water-level declines have varied in this agricultural region. Possible influences on these trends are changes in precipitation, land use, and onset and cessation of groundwater pumping. Precipitation records from four stations in the Mimbres Basin since 1964 are shown in Figure 22 (Western Regional Climate Center, 2021). Estimates of irrigated acreage and groundwater withdrawals and depletions in the Mimbres Basin are shown in Figure 23. These data were compiled from Sorenson (1977), Sorenson (1982), Wilson (1986), Wilson (1992), Wilson and Lucero (1997), Wilson et al. (2003), Longworth et al. (2008), Longworth et al. (2013), and Magnuson et al. (2019). 43 W A T E R - L E V E L T R E N D S I N T H E M I M B R E S B A S I N , S O U T H W E S T N E W M E X I C O Withdrawal is the quantity of water taken from a ground or surface water source. Depletion is that part of a withdrawal that has been evaporated, transpired, incorporated into crops or products, consumed by man or livestock, or otherwise removed from the water environment. It includes that portion of ground water recharge resulting from seepage or deep percolation (in connection with a water use) that is not economically recoverable in a reasonable number of years, or is not usable (Wilson, 1992). The NMOSE stopped calculat\u00ad ing depletions after 2003. Depletions for years after that shown in Figure 23 were estimated by using the average ratio of depletions to withdrawals from 1975 to 2000 of 60%. The NMOSE reported depletions but not withdrawals for 1969 and 1975. Withdrawals for these two years were estimated from average ratios of irrigated acreage to withdrawals, and depletions to withdrawals, for years in which all three types of data were available. From 1980 to 2005 the closed depression in the water table south of Deming defined by the 4100 foot contour expanded in area and depth, spreading to the southwest and southeast. After 2005 it became deeper but not much larger. Conversely, the closed depression northeast of Columbus defined by the 3900 foot contour decreased in size from 1980 to 2005, but then expanded greatly after 2005. The areas of net water-level rise west of Red Mountain, south of Akela, and northeast of Columbus all likely represent (partial) recovery of water levels and flattening of the water table after abandonment of extensive irrigation (Figure 14). Figure 23 shows that irrigated acreage, and groundwater withdrawals and depletions have declined since the 1970s across the Mimbres Basin as a whole, but have begun to increase in the last ten years. Delineating spatial and temporal trends of irrigated acreage within the basin using remote sensing imagery is a topic of ongoing research at the NMBGMR, so future work may be able to more accurately relate the patterns of water-level change seen in these maps with irrigation patterns. The areas of net water-level rise include two centers at Whitewater and Faywood (Figure 14). These are due to infiltration of streamflow in San Vicente Arroyo and emergence of deep- sourced water at springs around Faywood, including Faywood Hot Springs (Hawley et al., 2000). The springs at Faywood and associated net water-level rise are adjacent to the Silver City fault zone on the southwest side of the Pinos Altos Range that separates the range from the Mangas Trench or graben to the southwest (Figures 2 and 14; Hawley et al., 2000; Heywood, 2002). Although the net water-level change since 1980 is positive (Figure 14), the individual water-level change maps show that both of these areas have experienced water-level declines from 2010 \u2013 2015 and 2015 - 2020 (Figure 13). The precipitation trend in the Mimbres Basin (Figure 22) shows a steady decline since the 1980s. This long-term precipitation trend may be negatively affecting stream flow and spring discharge, causing the water-level declines. The reach of the Mimbres River south from where it emerges from the bedrock constriction east of Faywood to where it turns to the east, south of Black Mountain, is a region of net water-level rise (Figures 2 and Figure 14). This is the reach where flows in the river usually completely infiltrates; flow rarely extends to Deming. Groundwater-levels have both risen and fallen in this reach since 1980. This is probably due to variation in flow of the Mimbres River. There appears to be minimal structural control of the patterns of water-level change (Figure 14). Faults between Columbus and the West Potrillo Mountains approximately bound areas of water-level rise and decline. The Treasure Mountain Fault between Deming and Cooke\u2019s Range bounds the Mangas Trench on the northeast, separating basin-fill sediments from bedrock of the mountains, and also approximately bounds areas of net water-level rise and decline. The other mapped faults show little relation to the patterns of water level change, suggesting there is little structural compart\u00ad mentalization of the basin fill aquifer at the depths investigated by the wells in this study. Water-level predictions and patterns of water- level change are not reliable northeast of Faywood, Whitewater, and Silver City, due to the poor performance of the regional trend surface there because of the large topographic relief, and the general paucity of data.

Water-level predictions and patterns of water- level change are not reliable northeast of Faywood, Whitewater, and Silver City, due to the poor performance of the regional trend surface there because of the large topographic relief, and the general paucity of data. The most obvious manifestation are the areas shown in pink in the water level surfaces and change maps in this region, which are grid cells where the water level is predicted to be above the ground surface (Figures 14, 16, and 17). These areas are not indicated on the earlier figures for clarity, but the pattern is present for all of the data. The net water-level rise north of Silver City is not considered reliable. Net water-level rises in Cooke\u2019s Range and to the northeast are of somewhat questionable validity, as this is an area of generally high standard error (Figure 12). The same can be said for water-level changes along the eastern margin of the study area; although the regional trend model fits well here, the overall standard error is high. The area of net water-level rise northwest of Akela appears to be largely due to one measurement in well NM-05950, on 2/17/2020 (Figures 13, 14, and 15). This was a high-quality measurement in that it was repeatable, but the last measurement at this well was in N E W M E X I C O B U R E A U O F G E O L O G Y A N D M I N E R A L R E S O U R C E S : O F R 6 1 6 44 2002. Overall, there are few wells and data in this area. The sequential water level change maps (Figure 13) faithfully reproduce the small water-level changes in this well from 1982 to 2002 (Figure 15), yet they also reflect that fact that kriging is a smooth interpolator and that one data point can be highly influential in regions where data is sparse, regardless of the interpo\u00ad lation method used. The hydrographs in Figure 15 illustrates the variety of water level trends across the study area, with rises up to 83 feet (well NM-05950) and declines up to 84 feet (well NM-02018). Measured water levels are plot\u00ad ted with predicted values produced by spatio-temporal kriging. The latter includes two error bars, the smaller indicating the standard error from the regional trend model and the larger indicating the total standard error (regional trend plus spatiotemporal kriging). Note that the former is constant for each well while the latter varies though time. As in purely spatial kriging, the standard error estimates are independent of the actual data values, and are purely a function of the pattern of the measurements in space-time (or space alone in purely spatial kriging; Isaaks and Srivastava, 1989). The total standard error around each predicted water-level elevation on the hydrographs is the 95% confidence interval about that value, or the 95% con\u00ad fidence about the mean. The meaning of this is rather subtle. The entire water-level dataset used here may be viewed as a sample from a (normal or Gaussian) distribution of water levels spread over space and time. If the measurements in space and time that constitute the dataset could be repeated 100 times, and the trend model and spatiotemporal kriging were recalculated for each dataset repetition, then we would expect the mean value of all 100 predictions at each well point at the chosen prediction times to fall within the error bars 95 times, or 95% of the time (Ross, 2009, p. 377). The changes in water levels seen in the hydro\u00ad graphs match the changes in water levels seen on the maps through time (Figures 13 and 15). For wells with no recent measurements, the width of the confidence intervals increases as one moves further away in time from the last measurement (Figure 15; wells NM-02209, NM-02466, NM-02067), and is lower in intervals with abundant data (Figure 15; the early periods of wells NM-02209, NM-02246, NM-02018). This is a useful illustration of the advantage of the spatiotemporal method and can help clarify under\u00ad standing about the reliability of patterns of water-level change through time. For wells with very few measure\u00ad ments (Figure 15; well NM-04102), the spatiotemporal kriging method allows a systematic \u201cfilling out\u201d of the time series using data from other wells, and with a lower standard error than can be achieved using only spatial kriging at any given time instance. A possible application of this is to generate realistic, data-based, time series for water levels at wells, which could then be used for history-matching in calibrating groundwa\u00ad ter flow models. Spatial vs. Spatiotemporal Kriging Rawling and Rinehart (2018) and Rinehart et al. (2016) used extensive space-time datasets of water- level data to assess usable aquifer lifetimes and calcu\u00ad late storage changes over time periods of fifty years. In both studies, median water levels were calculated for each well for each decade, then spatial kriging was used to interpolate median water-level surfaces. The approach is straightforward and produced reliable and useful results in both studies, yet the information contained in the temporal correlation of water-levels is lost by using median water-levels at each well. In addition, at any given decade for which spatial kriging was performed, the extent of the interpolation was limited to regions within the correlation length (the range) around each well, which in some cases results in discontinuous prediction maps (Rinehart et al., 2016). This is significant as groundwater measurement networks are rarely spatially consistent through time. One can then only present a lower bound on some derivative quantity, for example storage changes, as a reliable value cannot be calculated in areas where predictions were not made.

In the spatiotemporal kriging method, predictions can be made at times for which there are no data, \u201cfilling out\u201d the time series as described above (Figure 15, well NM-4102), and allowing the spatial extent of predictions to be larger at any given time. In essence, every well with a measurement in the study area can contribute some information to prediction of a groundwater surface at any time the user chooses. Evenly spaced five-year intervals were chosen for this study, and Figure 12 shows that for most of the time instances very few data were available. The standard error is larger in areas and at times with sparse data, yet a prediction can be rigorously be made, and one can take the standard error into account in interpreta\u00ad tion or further analysis. Figure 12 shows that the increase in standard error is not significant in the time instances with few data\u2014this is because of the high correlation in time of the water-level data in this study. Spurious patterns of change that are an artifact of changing well networks are greatly reduced using the spatiotemporal method (Figure 17, Ruybal et al., 2019). 45 W A T E R - L E V E L T R E N D S I N T H E M I M B R E S B A S I N , S O U T H W E S T N E W M E X I C O Abandoned stock well south of the Florida Mountains N E W M E X I C O B U R E A U O F G E O L O G Y A N D M I N E R A L R E S O U R C E S : O F R 6 1 6 46 C O N C L U S I O N S This study has extended the long history of water- level measurements in the Mimbres Basin and used the geostatistical method of spatiotemporal kriging to create water-level maps every five years from 1980 until 2020. Changes in water-levels over these five- year intervals were calculated. Compared to spatial kriging, the spatiotemporal approach offers improved precision, more detailed maps of water levels and water-level changes, predictions at times with no data as well as at locations with no data, fewer artifacts due to changing well networks over time, and overall less uncertainty in predictions. Several important water-level trends since 1980 are revealed in the maps. In the areas of most abundant groundwater pumping for irrigation, from Deming to Columbus, water levels have declined up to 84 feet. Water-level declines and expansion of cones of depression appear to have slowed south of Deming and increased around Columbus in the past ten years. Water levels west of Red Mountain, east of the Florida Mountains, and northeast of Columbus have risen up to 42 feet, presumably as a result of declining irrigation in these areas that has resulted in flattening of cones of depression. The vicinity of Whitewater and Faywood shows net water-level rises over the 40 year period, but declines have occurred in the past ten years. Water-levels have varied consider\u00ad ably along the reach of the Mimbres River south of Faywood, where most of the river\u2019s flow infiltrates. The spatiotemporal kriging approach is more mathematically complex than spatial kriging, very demanding of computational resources, and multidi\u00ad mensional space-time datasets with thousands of data must be manipulated to implement it. The user must be familiar enough with the theory, methodology, and potential pitfalls to make informed decisions at several points during the analysis that will affect the final results. However, the cost in funds and staff- hours of field studies to gather water-level data has always been high and continues to rise. Therefore it is prudent to analyze the data collected at such great expense with methods that will extract the most useful information. The present work builds on the recent studies of Ruybal et al. (2019) and Varouchakis and Hristopulos (2019) to demonstrate that spatio\u00ad temporal kriging of water- level data is superior to spatial kriging in this regard. Any hydrogeologic analysis that is dependent on water-level maps should benefit from the improvements offered by spatiotemporal kriging. This includes assessment of water-level changes (as demonstrated here), assessment of storage changes, calibration of numerical groundwater-flow models, and design and updating of water-level monitoring networks.

The easting, northing, and land surface elevation coordinate of each well (in meters) was transformed into three principal components as shown in Table 1, and repeated here: PC1 PC2 PC3 Easting 0.53 -0.78 -0.34 Northing 0.57 -0.62 0.54 Land Surface Elevation -0.63 -0.09 -0.77 Standard Deviation 1.53 0.73 0.33 Proportion of Variance 0.78 0.18 0.04 Cumulative Proportion 0.78 0.96 1.00 The three coordinates were centered and standardized prior to the analysis. The three principal components are uncorrelated (geometrically orthogonal) and are linear combinations of the original data, where each coordinate is weighted by its loading on each component, e.g. \u200b The first two components explain 96% of the variation in the original data. These two components were combined in a third order polynomial function to derive a regional trend model. The function was fit to all of the water-level elevation data for each well, regardless of time. Ordinary least-squares fitting was implemented in R (R Core Team, 2018) to optimize the model. The resulting regional trend model is of the form: Where PC1 = x and PC2 = y.

The regional trend prediction at any well is constant through time, and the spatiotemporal kriging accounts for the temporal fluctuations in the water level. Ordinary least squares optimization of the regional trend model was used in this study. Ordinary least squares assumes that the residuals are independent and normally distributed (Schuenemeyer and Drew, 2011). The regional trend predictions were subtracted from the data values and the residuals were then interpolated with spatiotemporal kriging.

Ordinary least squares assumes that the residuals are independent and normally distributed (Schuenemeyer and Drew, 2011). The regional trend predictions were subtracted from the data values and the residuals were then interpolated with spatiotemporal kriging. This procedure is straightforward and commonly used with purely spatial krig\u00ad ing under the general name \u201cregression kriging\u201d (Hengl et al., 2003, 2007) The total variance of the resulting prediction, which is the sum of the separately calculated variance of the trend model prediction plus the kriging variance (spatial or spatiotemporal) is equal to the universal kriging variance, in which the regional trend model and the kriging weights are calculated simultaneously (Hengl et al., 2003, 2004). Figure A1.1. Example hydrograph showing regional trend model prediction at the well point, measured water levels, and spatiotemporal kriging prediction.

The resulting model does not yield minimum variance estimates unless the sample sites are selected randomly (although one could argue that the well locations in this study are essentially random samples of water levels in the aquifer, at least in space). The variogram calculated from the trend model residuals is biased because the residuals are spatially correlated and are nonlinearly dependent on the trend model parameters, which are themselves estimated from the same data and have errors. However, somewhat fortunately, the bias increases with lag distance in the variogram and the shorter spatial (and tempo\u00ad ral in this study) lags are most important in the kriging interpolation. Dealing with this issue rigorously is difficult and entails a significant increase in mathematical and com\u00ad putational complexity (Hengl et al., 2007; Lark and Webster, 2006; Webster and Oliver, 2007). Ordinary and generalized least squares optimization are used to estimate the regional trend, with the modelled covariance structure of the residuals (i.e., the variogram) from the former used as an input in the latter procedure. Iteration is usually required until the generalized least squares model parameters stabilize. Lark and Webster (2006) used the residual maximum likelihood method to estimate the regional trend of a geomorphic surface and it\u2019s vario\u00ad gram of residuals and showed variograms that were \u201csubstantially different\u201d from previous work that employed regression kriging using ordinary least squares. However, in the end, their estimation of the regional trend and residual variation did not differ notably from previous work, probably because of the importance of short lags in the variogram (Lark and Webster,2006). Hengl et al. (2007, p. 1305) commented that the covariance structure of residuals from a regional trend determined by generalized least squares \u201cin practice\u2026will hardly differ from the covariance structure of the ordinary least square residuals\u201d. Thus it is not clear that, in general, the extra effort required to address the shortcomings of ordinary least squares estimation of the regional trend surface is warranted. The issue was briefly explored here by using the R package caret (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/caret/vignettes/caret.html) to calculate a generalized linear model of the third order polynomial function of the first two principal components. This model only relaxes the assumption of independent, normally distributed residuals in fitting the model to the data; it does not address spatial correlation of the residuals. The resulting trend model coefficients were identical to those generated by ordinary least squares. Further calculations and the spatiotemporal kriging used the regional trend model gener\u00ad ated by ordinary least squares. One may conservatively assume that the results presented in the report contain some additional measure of bias and uncertainty beyond that shown, though the effect is likely to be small. 53 W A T E R - L E V E L T R E N D S I N T H E M I M B R E S B A S I N , S O U T H W E S T N E W M E X I C O A P P E N D I X 2 \u2013 C O M P A R I S O N O F S P A T I O T E M P O R A L V A R I O G R A M M O D E L S T O T H E E X P E R I M E N T A L V A R I O G R A M A s was observed by Ruybal et al.

Table A3.1 compares the model fitting parameters for the best-fitting model to the global data, and the best-fitting model to the data in each zone. Figures A3.1\u2013A3.4 illustrate global experi\u00ad mental variogram and best-fitting model, and the local region experimental variograms and their best-fitting models. The global model fits the global sample variogram better than any of the regional models fit the regional data. Put another way, the regional models are poorer representations of the regional spatiotemporal correlation structures, although all models appear to fit the smallest spatiotemporal lags reasonably well, and these are the most important for the kriging interpolation. The cross validation statistics in Table A3.2 indicate that the global model, when applied to the data from the individual regions, performs better in the Deming and San Vicente zone, and about as well in the Florida zone. There is no strong justification for choosing the added complexity of individual regional models over the global model, and so the global model was used in the subsequent analysis. Table A3.1.
