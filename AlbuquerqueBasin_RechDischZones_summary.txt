In the provided text, multiple sources reference how certain studies identified and mapped potential recharge zones. Key factors used to define these zones include soil vertical hydraulic conductivity, soil drainage class, surface slope, depth to groundwater, percolation times, clay content, and historical data (e.g., Hawley, 1996). Some specific locations—such as Bear Canyon Arroyo, Tijeras Arroyo, and areas near the San Juan-Chama Drinking Water Treatment Plant—were highlighted as suitable for shallow-based recharge. However, the text consistently notes that discharge zones were not explicitly defined or discussed. Additionally, there is mention of difficulties extracting complete information from the source PDF, so it is unclear from the provided text whether any given study definitively identified both recharge and discharge areas. Overall, the emphasized focus is on characterizing recharge zones and understanding groundwater flow changes, rather than formally establishing discharge zones.
