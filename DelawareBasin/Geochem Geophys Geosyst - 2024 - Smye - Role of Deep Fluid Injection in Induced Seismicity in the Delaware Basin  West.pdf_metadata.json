Eastwood1, R. Darvari1 , J. P. Nicot1 , and P. Hennings1 1Bureau of Economic Geology, Jackson School of Geosciences, The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX, USA Abstract Rates of seismicity in the Delaware Basin of Texas and New Mexico increased from 10 earthquakes per year of local magnitude (ML) 3.0 and above in 2017 to more than 185 in 2022, coincident with increasing oil and gas production and wastewater re\u2010injection into strata shallow or deeper than producing intervals. Events of large magnitude\u2014up to ML 5.4 to\u2010date\u2014occur on faults extending into formations above the basement that have received more than four billion barrels of injection. Here, we demonstrate the link between injection geology, pore pressure evolution, fault stability, and induced seismicity in this region. We find that the injection targets are largely dolomitized platform carbonates with low (<5 vol.%) matrix porosity and fracture\u2010enhanced permeability with inherent heterogeneity in flow properties. A comprehensive, three\u2010 dimensional geological model populated with reservoir properties is used for fluid flow modeling, with global calibration supplemented by dynamic injectivity data. Pore pressure changes with deep injection are up to 5 MPa from 1983 to 2023, increasing the native pore pressure state by 10% locally. Modeling results show that earthquakes occurring at distances of up to 30 km from deep injection have experienced small (<0.1 MPa) pore pressure increases, indicating that the faults hosting these earthquakes are highly sensitive to changes in effective stress and have lower frictional stability than the 0.6 generally assumed. These results serve as a critical step in understanding the stress changes that induce earthquakes in one of the most seismically active and geologically complex basins in the US. Plain Language Summary Earthquakes have become more frequent in areas with historically little seismicity and are coincident in space and time with an increase in oil and gas production and the re\u2010injection of wastewater. Larger\u2010magnitude earthquakes occur on deep faults and generally within the crystalline basement. They are likely caused by wastewater injection into carbonate rocks above the basement, causing changes in pressure and stress on nearby faults. Results from this modeling work show that deep fluid injection increases pressure by up to 10% near deep injection wells. 1. Introduction The Delaware Basin (DB) of West Texas (TX) and southeast New Mexico (NM) (Figure 1) is one of the most seismically active, geologically complex, and hydrocarbon\u2010productive basins in the U.S. Although the number of conventional vertical wells drilled per year declined \u223c75% from 2012 to 2022, horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing (HF) to recover hydrocarbons from low\u2010permeability formations increased by over 300% in that same time period. More than 20,000 horizontal wells have been drilled in the basin, with drilling rates peaking in 2018\u2013 2019, and again in 2022, at \u223c3,000 wells per year, targeting formations of Wolfcampian and Leonardian age (Figure 2). More than 5 billion barrels (Bbbl) of oil and 17 trillion cubic feet of gas have been produced from horizontal wells in the basin (S & P Global, 2023). Unconventional hydrocarbon production in the DB results in the co\u2010production of volumes of HF flowback and produced formation water that are more than double the volume of oil produced per well (Scanlon et al., 2020). This oilfield wastewater has high salinity (hence the term \u201csaltwater disposal,\u201d or SWD) and other impurities including organic compounds, and it must either be recycled for reuse in HF or injected into formations with porosity and permeability sufficient to accommodate fluid storage. Approximately 20 Bbbl of wastewater have been injected into the subsurface of the DB since 2010 for permanent disposal; 75% of that has gone into Guadalupian\u2010age Delaware Mountain Group sandstone reservoirs (Ge et al., 2022; Lemons et al., 2019; Smye, Banerji, et al., 2021) that are shallower than producing shale intervals (Figures 2 and 3).

More than four billion barrels have gone into deeper carbonate\u2010dominated formations of late Ordovician, Silurian, and Devonian age (Figures 2 and 3) (Gao et al., 2020), with injection depths ranging from 1,370 to 5,800 m (4,500\u201320,000 ft), averaging 3,570 m (11,700 ft). Although secondary in volume to shallow injection, deep injection is of primary importance in induced seismicity in the northern DB given that deep disposal is the most vertically proximal operational activity to seismicity (Figure 4), which occurs mainly in the crystalline basement. Vertical proximity of injection zones to the basement, or more generally, greater depth of injection, has been shown to be a risk factor for induced seismicity in many oilfield wastewater injection scenarios (e.g., Hincks et al., 2018; Skoumal & Trugman, 2021; Skoumal et al., 2018; Skoumal et al., 2020, 2021). Of the regions in the midcontinent of the U.S. that have little natural seismicity, the DB has seen the greatest increase in rates of seismicity in recent years, beginning in 2009 and further accelerating from 2016 (Ells- worth, 2013; Frohlich et al., 2020; Lomax & Savvaidis, 2019; Savvaidis et al., 2019). Since robust monitoring began in 2017, there have been more than 40 earthquakes of local magnitude (ML) \u22654.0 in the DB recorded by the Texas Seismological Network (TexNet, 2023) and the New Mexico Tech Seismological Observatory (NMT).

Earthquake rates increased from 10 per year of ML \u22653.0 in 2017 to more than 185 in 2022 (TexNet, NMT). In the southern DB earthquake zone (SDBEZ) (Figure 1), earthquakes frequently occur in the sedimentary section rather than in the crystalline basement (Figure 4), and shallow SWD and HF have been shown to be causal agents (Grigoratos et al., 2022; Savvaidis et al., 2020; Zhai et al., 2021). These earthquakes appear to be limited to ML \u22644 and the earthquake rate in this sub\u2010region has declined in recent years (Hennings, Dvory, et al., 2021). However, in the northern DB earthquake zone (NDBEZ) of NM and TX addressed in this study and delimited on its southern end by the Grisham Fault Zone (GFZ) (Figure 1), earthquake rates have remained elevated. This region includes a dense area of seismicity spanning Culberson and Reeves Co., TX, called the Culberson\u2010 Mentone earthquake zone (CMEZ) (Figure 1), including the ML 4.9 \u201cMentone\u201d earthquake that occurred in 2020 and the ML 5.4 \u201cCoalson Draw\u201d event that occurred in late 2022. Other notable events in the NDBEZ include the ML 4.0 \u201cCounty Line\u201d earthquake spanning Eddy and Lea Co., NM, which occurred in 2021 (NMT). Hypocentral depths for earthquakes reported in the NDBEZ are consistent with events occurring in the crystalline basement, with average event depths of 7.7 km (25,000 ft) below the ground surface and 6.6 km (22,000 ft) below mean sea level (MSL) (Figure 4), and average depth uncertainty of 1.5 km (4,900 ft) for TexNet events and depths of 5 km reported for NMT events. Probabilistic associations between operational activities and earthquakes show a likely causal influence of deep injection on earthquakes in NM and in Culberson Co., TX (Grigoratos et al., 2022). However, many of these earthquakes occur at distances of 30 km (20 mi) from injection wells, and probabilistic associations with deep SWD are weak, leading previous authors to interpret cascading earthquake interactions initially induced by deep SWD. While deep injection has been implicated in induced seismicity in this system (e.g., Skoumal & Trugman, 2021), analysis of pore pressure changes associated with deep injection in these units using comprehensive models has not been carried out, and is a key step in causal assessment of induced seismicity regionally, and for analogous application elsewhere. Here we seek to understand the role of deep injection in induced seismicity in the northern DB through modeling of pore pressure changes with injection using a detailed geologic model of the injection stratigraphy. The link between induced earthquakes and anthropogenic activities is complex in this region given the varied subsurface operational activities, involvement of multiple stratigraphic intervals, and the complex geologic character, necessitating mechanistic analyses to understand the role of specific operational activities in induced seismicity and to enable mitigation. Mechanistic analysis of induced seismicity begins with detailed geological character- ization and assessment of stress change from pore pressure evolution modeling\u2014we provide these contributions here and relate them to earthquake occurrence. 2. Geologic Background The DB of West TX and southeast NM is part of the greater Permian Basin (PB) region, which encompasses all or part of 37 counties in Texas and NM and covers \u223c90,000 km2 (34,000 mi2). Formations targeted for deep in- jection and studied here are largely pre\u2010 and syntectonic with respect to structural differentiation of the Delaware and Midland sub\u2010basins and the intervening basement\u2010rooted uplifted Central Basin Platform (CBP) (Figure 1). The PB region extends across several basement terranes which assembled during the Proterozoic period from 1.30 to 1.07 Ga. These terranes include the southern crystalline area, the northern crystalline area, and the southern Project administration: K. M. Smye, P. Hennings Resources: K. M. Smye Software: A. Calle, R.

The Ordovician\u2010age Ellenburger Group (Figure 2) is likely the oldest of these rocks in the PB, apart from siliciclastics of unknown age that sit above the basement locally, filling Precambrian basement paleotopographic lows (Ruppel, 2019a). Along with its age\u2010equivalents including the Arbuckle Group, the Ellenburger Group has been targeted for deep injection in other basins in the midcontinent of the U.S. including the Fort Worth Basin (Gao et al., 2021; Hennings et al., 2019; Hornbach et al., 2016; Smye et al., 2019), Midland Basin (Woo & Ellsworth, 2023), and in basins of Oklahoma (Walsh & Zoback, 2015; Weingarten et al., 2015). Carbonates of the Ellenburger Group are dominated by karsted limestone and dolomite of peritidal and shallow subtidal origin (Loucks & Kerans, 2019). Karst features are widespread and likely regionally extensive (e.g., Sanchez et al., 2019; Smye et al., 2019), but correlation of these exposure surfaces in the sub- surface has proved challenging. Global sea level fall in the late Early Ordovician to early Middle Ordovician resulted in the Ellenburger Group being unconformably overlain by the Simpson Group (Figure 2), which contains increased siliciclastic content related to reflooding of the shelf. Source areas for Simpson Group sandstones were likely to the north and west of Figure 2.

Perhaps importantly, this platform margin turns south in the western DB, such that Wristen Group rocks to the north and west are largely shallow water platform carbonates, and to the south and east are dominantly mudrocks.

Differentiation of Silurian and Devonian rocks in the subsurface is challenging due to their lith- ologic similarity, and to truncation and removal by Middle Devonian uplift and erosion (Ruppel, Hovorka, & Barnaby, 2019) that is evidenced by karsting of Silurian and Early Devonian rocks. Following marine flooding, the Late Devonian Woodford Formation was deposited on this karsted Silurian and Early Devonian surface, locally infilling topographic lows.

A sea\u2010level highstand in the Mississippian resulted in deposition of the Mississippian Limestone associated with an extensive carbonate platform, followed by deep- water mudrock deposition of the Mississippian Barnett Formation. The Pennsylvanian was marked by major tectonic activity associated with the final collision of the Laurentian and Gondwanan plates, resulting in the formation of the structural features that define the geometry of the PB, including the CBP separating the Midland and Delaware Basins (Ewing, 1990, 1991; Horne et al., 2021; Yang & Dorobek, 1995). Sedimentation patterns in the Pennsylvanian reflect this structural differentiation, with early carbonate and mixed carbonate\u2010siliciclastic shelf deposits followed by Late Pennsylvanian basinal facies in the DB, surrounded by carbonate platforms to the west, north (Northwest Shelf) and east (CBP) (Wright, 2011). Early (Wolfcampian) and Middle (Leonardian) Permian shale development intervals are dominantly mixed carbonate\u2010 siliciclastic systems. Importantly, these units exhibit a degree of overpressure that has been maintained for millions of years (Sinclair, 2007; Luo et al., 1994), indicating that they have very low permeability and serve as an effective no\u2010flow boundary at the top of the modeled domain. Two distinct and seemingly kinematically disconnected sets of faults occur in the DB (Figure 3). The first set are characterized as contractional basement\u2010rooted faults, which form the general structure of the basin and separate it from the N\u2010S\u2010trending uplifted CBP (Horne et al., 2021). These faults are rooted in the Proterozoic basement and tip out vertically in lower portions of the Wolfcamp Formation, therefore impacting the deep injection intervals of Silurian and Devonian age, and appear to host most of the deep earthquakes in the DB (Hennings, Dvory, et al., 2021; Horne et al., 2021). Notably, the E\u2010W\u2010trending GFZ (Figure 1) consists of an important set of basement\u2010rooted faults that bisect the DB and fully cut the deep injection units. The second set is characterized as a shallow, extensional fault system that is mostly strata\u2010bound to the Delaware Mountain Group (Horne et al., 2022). These faults trend parallel to the azimuth of maximum horizontal stress (SHmax), dip steeply, host linear arrays of shallow earthquakes, and frequently displace the ground surface, as observed in surface defor- mation maps from the Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (Hennings, Dvory, et al., 2021; Horne et al., 2022; Pepin et al., 2022; Staniewicz et al., 2020). The state of neotectonic stress in the PB region transitions from a normal faulting regime in the west (DB) to a normal/strike\u2010slip regime in the east (CBP and Midland Basin) based on in situ measurements, geologic and seismogenic data (Lund Snee & Zoback, 2018). In the normal faulting stress field of the DB, vertical stress (Sv) is the greatest principal stress (S1), and its magnitude is 0.0239\u20130.0240 MPa/m (1.06\u20131.1 psi/ft) (Smye, Hennings, & Horne, 2021). Large variations in the azimuth of the maximum horizontal compressive stress (SHmax) have been documented, with rotations from roughly north\u2010south in the northern DB (NM) to east\u2010southeast\u2010west\u2010southwest in the south (Lund Snee & Zoback, 2018), likely due to elevated pore pressures and small differences between the horizontal stresses, as has been observed in other regions (e.g., Moos & Zoback, 1993), as well as structural complexity related to late Paleozoic tectonism from the combined Ancestral Rocky Mountain and Ouachita\u2010 Marathon orogenic events (Horne et al., 2021).

(2021) used well density data (Sv), borehole breakouts (SHmax azimuth), qualitative estimates of faulting stress regime from available fault slip and focal mechanism data (A\u03c6) to provide representative stress tensors for 20 sub\u2010regions of the DB and provided an uncertainty analysis as well as a most\u2010likely"

Hydrogeology The general features of groundwater flow in the DB under natural conditions are well\u2010known, and can be described by five flow units, the deepest of which is the topic of this study (fifth unit) (Figure 2). The first unit is composed of fresh or brackish water aquifers hosted by a veneer of mostly post\u2010Permian sediments overlying an evaporite succession of Late Permian age (second unit) that forms a thick confining layer. The third flow unit consists of the siliciclastic Delaware Mountain Group that has been evaluated previously as the shallow injection interval in the DB (Ge et al., 2022). It overlies the thick producing units of the Bone Spring and Wolfcamp Formation (fourth unit), which forms another confining system containing low\u2010permeability shales. All five units have received secular recharge on their western and/or northern boundaries and the general flow of the entire system is to the east/southeast, following the general topographic slope (Engle et al., 2016). However, if the first flow unit is dynamic at the human scale, the aqueous phase of the other units can be considered stagnant, especially when compared to and dominated by injection\u2010driven flow.

Methods 3.1. Geologic Characterization Characterization of the stratigraphic architecture and reservoir properties of deep injection intervals provides the basis for hydrogeologic modeling. While the model domain is restricted to north of the GFZ, geologic charac- terization extends beyond the model boundaries to provide control on the stratigraphic and lithologic character of injection formations. 3.1.1. Stratigraphic Interpretation The stratigraphic architecture of deep injection intervals was interpreted through correlation of formation tops in 3,151 wells that penetrate sub\u2010Wolfcamp strata and have digital geophysical logs for further analysis (Figure S2 in Supporting Information S1). Formation tops from Geologic Data Services (IHS Energy, 2009) and those identified by operators and provided to commercial databases (S & P Global, 2023) were quality checked and included in the data set. Key units were correlated using a lithostratigraphic approach, meaning that in the absence of major lithologic changes in the sedimentary section, formations were grouped into \u201cdisposal units.\u201d The top of the model boundary is the base of the Pennsylvanian\u2010age interval of the Wolfcamp Formation (base of Wolfcamp D) (Figure 2). The units underlying the Wolfcamp D are Pennsylvanian\u2010age carbonates of the Strawn Group and Atoka Formation in the northern DB study area, which grade into mudrocks in the central DB. The Pennsylvanian\u2010age Strawn Group, Atoka Formation and Morrow Formation were not differentiated, and are treated as one Pennsylvanian\u2010age disposal unit. Below the Pennsylvanian\u2010age formations, the Barnett Formation was correlated with 1,636 wells. The Barnett Formation is interpreted by an increased gamma ray (GR) log signature (>100 API) indicative of the presence of clay in the dominantly mudrock lithology. The contact between the Barnett Formation and the overlying Morrow Formation is gradational, so correlation also utilizes the density and neutron porosity logs, with decreased density indicative of increased total organic carbon and porosity, both of which decrease the bulk density log response. Underlying the Barnett Formation is a thin limestone of lower Mississippian age, the Mississippian Limestone, which is identified by its low GR and high resistivity log signature. Underlying the Mississippian Limestone, the Woodford Formation is interpreted by its very high GR log response, frequently exceeding the recorded values in well logs, associated with high clay and total organic carbon volumes. While the Woodford Formation was identified in the stratigraphic analysis, reservoir characterization was limited to fewer wells due to poor log quality in this interval, with lithologic interpretation requiring repair of the GR log response using the density log. Main injection units of Silurian and Devonian age underlie the Woodford Formation and are correlated by the sharp decrease in GR below the base of the high\u2010gamma ray Woodford in 1786 wells. Because these formations are challenging to differentiate with petrophysical logs alone, and because of the absence of clear lithologic variation and flow barriers, the Montoya Formation, Devonian Thirtyone Formation, and Fusselman Formation were interpreted as one Silurian\u2010Devonian disposal unit (Figure 2). This approach is consistent with previous work suggesting that this dominantly carbonate section was deposited consistently without interruption apart from minor changes in sea level (Frenzel et al., 1998). The base of the Silurian\u2010Devonian disposal unit is the Simpson Group, which is identified in 952 wells by its increased GR and porosity log responses compared to over\u2010 and underlying formations. The contact between the Simpson and Ellenburger Groups was identified by a decrease in GR and increase in resistivity log responses in 1,105 wells that penetrate the Ellenburger Group. However, most of these wells are located where the formation is shallowest along the CBP margin. Although the lithology of the crystalline basement and the nature of the basement\u2010sediment interface are likely important for understanding the connection between injection and basement\u2010hosted earthquakes, characterization of the basement was not possible given few (\u223c35) basement well penetrations in the study area, most of which are lacking robust log suites for petrophysical characterization. 3.1.2.

Photoelectric curves were combined with bulk density curves to derive the cross\u2010section/cc. Initial estimates of clay volume from differences in neutron and density porosity logs, and from rescaled GR logs were computed and compared. The Mineral Solver tool in IP\u00ae was used to compute mineral volumes and porosity. The optimized solver approach allows for solving a linear system of equations while minimizing the error between input log variables and the forward\u2010modeled version of these variables computed from the solver results. Input logs included density and neutron porosity, GR, curves derived from photoelectric effect logs, and clay volume derived from neutron porosity logs. In the absence of a photoelectric log, which is key for differentiating limestone from dolomite, a log proxy N (Burke et al., 1969) was computed from porosity\u2010independent crossplots of density and neutron porosity, where N is the slope of a line connecting 0% and 100% porosity end points. This approach has been useful in other carbonate\u2010dominated systems for identification of lithology (e.g., Smye et al., 2019 for the Ellenburger Group of the Fort Worth Basin), and was calibrated to mineral solver model results with N \u22640.55 for dolomite and N > 0.55 for limestone, respectively, to reflect dolomitic and calcitic mineralogy. Volumes of quartz, calcite, clay, dolomite and porosity were computed in the optimized log solver. Where sonic logs were available, the sonic log response in the Ellenberger Group carbonates was used to aid in validating relative amounts of calcite and dolomite computed by the solver. Multi\u2010formulae scripts were used to estimate the mechanical properties of lithologies encountered by the well while accounting for the impact of overpressure (Eastwood & Smye, 2021), which may exist in clay\u2010rich Pennsylvanian and Mississippian strata. Estimation of mechanical properties begins with the M elasticity modulus, which requires bulk density and compressional transit time logs, from which Young's Modulus (E) and bulk modulus (K) are computed by use of Poisson's ratio (\u03bd) in well\u2010known relationships between elastic moduli (Zoback, 2007). The algorithm for computation of \u03bd may underestimate \u03bd in lithologies that exhibit total porosity greater than 0.08 to 0.10 v/v, such as sandstones of the Simpson Group. Mineral volumes interpreted by petrophysical analysis were grouped into rock types or lithologies based on dominant mineralogy. Four generalized rock types were interpreted: limestone (calcite\u2010dominated), dolostone (dolomite\u2010dominated), siliciclastic (quartz\u2010dominated) and mudrock (clay\u2010dominated) for a total of 120 wells (Figure S2 in Supporting Information S1). For wells in which mineral volumes could not be computed using an optimized mineral solver model due to an under constrained system, lithology was assigned using simplified log models (Table S1 in Supporting Information S1) calibrated to results for wells with mineral solver model results. 3.2. 3D Geologic Model We use the correlation of lithologic and stratigraphic layers, general structural control, and petrophysical analysis to develop a 3D geological model of the northern DB, within which reservoir properties are distributed. The geomodel spans basement through Pennsylvanian strata and encompasses all or parts of four counties in TX and two (Eddy and Lea) in southeast NM, covering an areal extent of roughly 28,000 km2 (10,800 mi2). The model is bounded to the east by the western structural boundary of the CBP and to the south by the GFZ, both of which nearly or completely offset the intervals of interest. These boundaries are assumed to be no\u2010flow. The North- western Shelf and Diablo Plateau (Figure 1) define the northern and western boundaries of the geomodel, respectively; while no\u2010flow conditions may not be strictly applicable to the northern and western boundaries where there is no evidence of faults offsetting the intervals of interest, these areas are distal from operational activity, specifically deep injection. The geomodel was constructed using PETREL (v.2019.4) with a horizontal cell size of 500 m \u00d7 500 m (1,640 \u00d7 1,640 ft), and an average vertical cell size of 5 m (10 ft), totaling 137 \u00d7 106 cells. Of the wells utilized in the regional stratigraphic interpretation, 1,513 wells are contained in the study area and used in the geomodel, 35 of which penetrate the Precambrian basement. The model is compartmentalized into eight lithostratigraphic zones, with a lower model boundary defined at 600 m below the basement\u2010sediment interface, assuming a permeability decrease associated with crystalline and metamorphic basement examples observed elsewhere (Gao et al., 2021). To reproduce the stratal layering geometry and maintain documented lateral fluid continuity among zones, we used an onlap grid for the Ellenburger, Simpson, and Woodford zones, a truncation grid for the Silurian\u2010Devonian zone, and proportional zones for the Base Wolfcamp, Barnett, Mississippian Limestone, and Precambrian base zones.

See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License Although basement\u2010rooted reverse and shallow extensional faults are present in the study area (Horne et al., 2021, 2022), they were not modeled explicitly. Apart from those faults bounding the model, that is, the GFZ on the southern boundary, their throws are minor compared to the thickness of the modeled units, and their properties are uncertain. For the purpose of this model, the top (base Wolfcamp) boundary is assumed to be no flow because of the significant contrast in matrix permeability, as evidenced by generation and millions\u2010of\u2010years retention of overpressure in the overlying shale intervals (e.g., Luo et al., 1994; Sinclair, 2007). Lithofacies, porosity and permeability were upscaled and distributed in the geomodel. The vertical resolution of these properties is 15 cm in each well. The lithofacies model was built on a by\u2010facies basis one zone at a time, allowing separate retention of data for each facies in each zone. The first step in the reservoir modeling process was to create a generic subdivision of the reservoir based on five generalized rock types (shale, siliciclastic, limestone, dolomite, and granite for Precambrian basement). This lithology classification allows representation of the reservoir heterogeneity and calculation of statistics for reservoir modeling using the stochastic sequential indicator simulation, which allows for reservoir properties to be distributed within the constructed 3D structural grid. Lithofacies were key in conditioning the matrix porosity model, which was simulated using the Gaussian random function. Porosity\u2010permeability transforms were used as a first approach to model the matrix permeability field by assuming similar rock fabrics and utilizing core petrophysical values in Ruppel (2019b) and Ruppel, Hovorka, and Barnaby (2019) in porosity\u2010permeability transforms from Lucia (1993). 3.3. Pore Pressure Model 3.3.1. Model Setup The modeling package CMG\u2010STARS v.2019.10 (Computer Modelling Group CMG, 2019) was used to evaluate the pore pressure history. The flow model has 20 layers, from Pennsylvanian to Precambrian basement, con- strained by the stratigraphic interpretation. The model corner\u2010point grid is 270 \u00d7 220 km2 (168 \u00d7 137 mi2) with 123 \u00d7 116 \u00d7 20 cells of approximately 1.6 \u00d7 1.6 km2 (1 \u00d7 1 mi2) and includes 285,360 active cells. The average cell thickness is 103 m (337 ft) and the thickness of 85% of the cells around the median ranges from 24 to 183 m (80 to 600 ft). Grid cells are aligned in the N\u2010S direction. Fluid properties such as viscosity and density were computed as a function of temperature, pressure, and salinity. Data including monthly injection volumes, average wellhead pressures, bottomhole pressure (BHP) estimated from surface pressure, and temperature data were obtained from the Railroad Commission of Texas (RRC) H\u201010 forms, and from commercial databases including S&P Global IHS Markit and B3 Insight. The data were quality\u2010 controlled based on previous experience (Gao et al., 2021; Ge et al., 2022; Lemons et al., 2019). Physical characteristics of the SWD wells, such as perforated intervals, open hole or cased status, and tubing dimensions were sourced from S&P Global IHS Markit. Porosity and permeability derived from petrophysical analyses and distributed in the geomodel are best under- stood as a representation of the rock matrix properties, while dynamic fluid flow in karsted carbonate systems is mainly a function of fracture and fault systems. Populated and distributed permeability data from log and core data were used as a \u201cpermeability index\u201d and supplemented with larger\u2010scale permeability values estimated from injection rate and SWD well head pressures (Figures S3 and S4 in Supporting Information S1) and step\u2010rate tests obtained from the RRC. These field permeability values best represent the regional permeability that accommodates fluid injection (Figure S5 in Supporting Information S1). Injectivity\u2010derived permeability was estimated from the quality controlled history injection data from SWD wells by assuming steady\u2010state flow conditions, constant water viscosity of 1 cP (1 kPa\u2219s), constant wellbore radius of 0.076 m (0.25 ft) and constant effective radius of 304.8 m (1,000 ft). These calculated permeability values were added to the flow model at their original SWD well lo- cations, with the assumption that SWD wells are usually located in higher permeability zones. Injectivity\u2010derived permeability locations are more numerous than log\u2010derived permeability locations and were critical in areas with a lack of petrophysical data (Ge et al., 2022). Injectivity\u2010derived permeability from 175 data points shows a median of 11.2 md and mean of 21.8 md (Figure S3a in Supporting Information S1). These data were complemented by permeability values from 35 field data points taken from historical reservoir records that show a median of 10.0 md and mean of 40.6 md (Figure S3b in Supporting Information S1), resulting in combined permeability of 10.6 and 24.0 md for median and mean, Geochemistry, Geophysics, Geosystems 10.1029/2023GC011260 SMYE ET AL. 10 of 33 15252027, 2024, 6, Downloaded from https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2023GC011260 by New Mexico Institute Of Mining, Wiley Online Library on [01/04/2025].

Injectivity\u2010derived permeability locations are more numerous than log\u2010derived permeability locations and were critical in areas with a lack of petrophysical data (Ge et al., 2022). Injectivity\u2010derived permeability from 175 data points shows a median of 11.2 md and mean of 21.8 md (Figure S3a in Supporting Information S1). These data were complemented by permeability values from 35 field data points taken from historical reservoir records that show a median of 10.0 md and mean of 40.6 md (Figure S3b in Supporting Information S1), resulting in combined permeability of 10.6 and 24.0 md for median and mean, Geochemistry, Geophysics, Geosystems 10.1029/2023GC011260 SMYE ET AL. 10 of 33 15252027, 2024, 6, Downloaded from https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2023GC011260 by New Mexico Institute Of Mining, Wiley Online Library on [01/04/2025].

Field and injectivity\u2010derived permeability data vary by formation but are most abundant in the Silurian\u2010Devonian intervals where many of the SWD wells are located (Figure S4 in Supporting Information S1). The field and injectivity\u2010derived permeability, together with the log\u2010derived permeability data points, were combined as control points in the geomodel to create upscaled well logs and generate variograms. The variograms were used in the petrophysical modeling process in the geomodel to generate realizations of the 3D permeability field using a sequential Gaussian simulation method, as is common in reservoir characterization studies, with a lithofacies\u2010specific permeability realization. This uncalibrated horizontal permeability (Kh) field was then exported to the flow model to be optimized during the calibration process (Section 3.3.3). Vertical permeability values were assumed to have a constant Kv/Kh ratio per layer, with Kv/Kh set to 0.1 (base case). However, in clay\u2010rich layers including the Woodford and Barnett, a Kv/Kh of 0.01 was used to account for the low vertical permeability conditions. Compressibility is the other parameter controlling diffusivity in addition to permeability. Compressibility values were computed using sonic and density logs. Initially, the M elasticity modulus was computed as M = VP 2 \u03c1, where VP is the compressional wave velocity and \u03c1 is density, or \u03c1/\u0394TC 2, where \u0394TC is the compressional wave transit time. The shear modulus, G, is then computed by G = M (1 \u22122\u03bd)/(2 \u22122\u03bd), where \u03bd is Poisson's ratio. The bulk modulus K can be calculated by K = M \u2212 4 G/3, and is the inverse of compressibility. Log\u2010derived compressibility values range from 4 to 27.6 \u00d7 10\u22126 (1/psi). Model parameters used here are comparable to those used for modeling of other deep carbonate injection systems in other basins, for example, Gao et al. (2021). Injection wells (n = 239) were modeled with monthly injection rates from January 1983 to December 2022. Injection well completions are a combination of openhole (n = 152) and perforated (n = 81), and combined (n = 6) with openhole intervals of 60\u2013600 m (200\u20132,000 ft) and most wells having an openhole interval of 300\u2013 600 m (1,000\u20132,000 ft). Sections with perforated intervals range from 6 to 600 m (20 to 2,000 ft), with most wells having a section with perforated intervals of 60\u2013150 m (200\u2013500 ft) (Figure S6 in Supporting Information S1). 3.3.2. Initial Conditions Initial pressure and temperature for the flow model were estimated using initial shut\u2010in pressure measurements obtained from drill\u2010stem tests for sub\u2010Wolfcamp formations. The pressure data points (n = 1,034) are consistent with an initial pressure gradient of 0.46 psi/ft (Figure S7a in Supporting Information S1) and temperature data points (n = 207) and are consistent with a temperature gradient of 1.05 F/100 ft (Figure S7b in Supporting In- formation S1) (Table S2 in Supporting Information S1), in line with values noted from well headers during petrophysical analysis. When assigned to injection stratigraphy, initial pressure gradients are 0.479 psi/ft (n = 472) for Pennsylvanian and Mississippian formations, 0.457 psi/ft (n = 227) for Silurian and Devonian, and 0.463 psi/ft (n = 124) for Ordovician. However, prior to injection, the flow model is at equilibrium (no flow, density\u2010stratified), which is reached by running a long \u201cmulti\u2010century\u201d transient simulation before injection begins (Ge et al., 2022). Formation water salinity ranges from 20,000 to 200,000 ppm; pore water is relatively fresh toward the west of the DB, where the sedimentary cover is thinner and secular recharge occurs, but it increases to high values against the CBP and with depth (Blondes et al., 2018). Injection water salinity was estimated to have a constant value of 120,000 ppm as measured from produced water total dissolved solids (TDS) measurements; however, the TDS is known to vary across the Basin (Nicot et al., 2020). Water is modeled as a mixture of two geochemical com- ponents: saline water of 20,000 ppm at the shallowest depth and saline water of 200,000 ppm at the deepest part of the model. The initial salinity field is modeled as containing variable fractions of these two components. 3.3.3. Model Calibration Calibration of the flow model is carried out globally (across the entire model) and relies on analyzing wellhead injection pressures and converting them to equivalent BHPs. The wellhead flowing pressures range from \u223c1 psi to >3,500 psi (0\u201324.1 MPa), with an average of \u223c1,100 psi (7.6 MPa). Surface pressures were converted to equivalent BHPs using an algorithm by considering fraction losses (0\u20131,543 psi), that is, the energy lost as the fluid travels through the wellbore due to friction between the fluid and pipe, which are estimated by assuming a relatively low absolute roughness coefficient of 1.3 \u00d7 10\u22125 in for the steel casing (Bourgoyne et al., 1986).

Sensitivity Studies and Scenario Testing Results for selected sensitivity cases are reported as the change in differential pressure from model base case (\u0394Pp) results and Root\u2010Mean Square error (RMSE, Table S3 in Supporting Information S1). The sensitivity of pore pressure changes to model parameters was investigated by scaling porosity, horizontal permeability, vertical permeability, and compressibility up and down by a factor of two, and by changing the relative anisotropy in horizontal permeability. It is well established, especially for stiff and fractured reservoir rock, that permeability can be enhanced in the direction parallel to the azimuth of maximum horizontal stress (SHmax) in a normal faulting regime such as the DB (Barton et al., 1995; Hennings et al., 2012). We therefore include consideration of hor- izontal permeability anisotropy in our uncertainty analysis by keeping the overall permeability constant but varying its directional proportions. The model was split into two areas: one in which SHmax orientations are largely in the N\u2010S direction, and one in which SHmax is closer to E\u2010W (Figure 1) (Dvory & Zoback, 2021; Lund Snee & Zoback, 2018; Lundstern & Zoback, 2020). Two scenarios were tested: in the first scenario, KI = 2Ko, KJ = 0.5Ko where SHmax azimuth is N\u2010S, and KI = 0.5Ko, KJ = 2Ko where SHmax is E\u2010W, with KI = permeability in the x direction, KJ = permeability in the y direction, and Ko = original permeability field. In the second scenario, KI = 4/3Ko, KJ = 3/4Ko where SHmax azimuth is N\u2010S, and KI = 3/4Ko and KJ = 4/3Ko where SHmax is E\u2010W. Comparisons of flow model results and the \u0394Pp required to reach slip criticality were performed for a subset of the basement\u2010rooted faults in the CMEZ region (Figure 1) that have hosted recent seismicity. Three parameters were modified to achieve a match between modeled \u0394Pp and slip criticality: local increase in permeability, increase in overall injection rate and volumes through addition of injection wells, and adjustments in rock compressibility (Table S2 in Supporting Information S1). 3.4. Analysis of Seismicity and \u0394Pp To enable quantitative comparison of \u0394Pp and earthquakes, an analysis of trends in seismicity in the northern DB region was carried out. Earthquakes occurring in the study area consist of 1,559 from NMT Seismological Observatory with local magnitudes (ML) ranging from 0.3 to 4.03, and 9,098 from TexNet of ML of 0.1\u20135.4 from January 2017 to December 2022, with a magnitude of completeness for the TexNet catalog of ML 1.55 (Huang et al., 2022). Due to high uncertainty in earthquake hypocentral depths (averaging 1.5 km or 4,900 ft for TexNet earthquakes analyzed), the vertical dimension was not considered for sampling of \u0394Pp. However, earthquake relative depths within clusters were compared because the events are spatiotemporally limited. Pore pressure models were sampled at earthquake epicenters using Python 3 and Jupyter Notebook libraries to extract and refine high\u2010resolution pressure data from the reservoir simulation output generated in CMG. The middle layer of the Silurian\u2010Devonian injection interval was selected as representative of \u201cdeep injection strata\u201d because it is the zone most frequently injected into and represents the approximate maximum \u0394Pp on basement\u2010 rooted faults extending into the deep injection interval. The extraction algorithm interpolates between time steps prior to and after earthquake events to deliver a pressure matrix corresponding to each earthquake. Earthquake location\u2010specific \u0394Pp is achieved using a K\u2010Nearest Neighbor approach, with pressure data interpolated using an inverse distance\u2010weighted algorithm. Clustering analysis was performed to identify groups of earthquakes that may represent individual faults and to enable characterization of the spatiotemporal evolution of earthquake clusters in the presence of increased \u0394Pp. Earthquakes were clustered using the density\u2010based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) algorithm (Ester et al., 1996) in MATLAB. This algorithm partitions observations into clusters based on a threshold for a neighborhood search radius and the minimum number of neighbors required to identify a core point and is frequently used in the analysis of earthquakes to assess spatiotemporal evolution (e.g., Schoenball & Ellsworth, 2017; Skoumal et al., 2019). Time and depth were not used as input in the clustering analysis to enable assessment of behavior of earthquake clusters over time with pore pressure evolution, and because the uncertainty in depth is the greatest among spatial locations. Because two earthquake catalogs were used with varying event densities, the algorithm was applied at two levels of spatial resolution using parameters based on estimated epsilon nearest neighbor analysis for each earthquake catalog. Regional clusters were identified using a Geochemistry, Geophysics, Geosystems 10.1029/2023GC011260 SMYE ET AL. 12 of 33 15252027, 2024, 6, Downloaded from https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2023GC011260 by New Mexico Institute Of Mining, Wiley Online Library on [01/04/2025].

The search radius and minimum number of earthquakes required to identify a cluster were modified to 500 m and 20, respectively, for the CMEZ due to higher event density. Regional clustering of earthquakes in the study resulted in the identification of 17 clusters, with an average of 85 earthquakes per cluster and 988 unclustered events (Figure S9 in Supporting Information S1). Most events in the NMT catalog are unclustered due to the distance between earthquakes as currently located in horizontal space. In the regional clustering approach, earthquakes in the CMEZ form one large cluster due to the close spacing of events. Decreasing the neighborhood search radius resulted in the identification of 30 clusters in this sub\u2010region, with an average of 237 earthquakes per cluster and 2,243 unclustered events. 3.5.

Assessing Stability of Recently Seismogenic Basement\u2010Rooted Faults We quantified the likely \u0394Pp required to push faults to criticality and characterized their native stability in a static stress analysis using the 3DStress\u00ae software tool (https://www.swri.org/3dstress\u2010geology\u2010software). Previously, the stability of mapped faults in the DB was characterized using the most likely stress tensor in the relevant stress domain (Morris et al., 2021). Here, we map and study five representative basement\u2010rooted fault segment traces that are known to host large\u2010magnitude events and have a range of fault orientations, and we characterize the range of stability given all possible stress states in each region. Utilizing recent earthquake hypocentral locations and fault plane solutions along with data described in Horne et al. (2021), basement\u2010rooted fault segments were mapped as traces representing the approximate hanging wall intersection between the basement\u2010rooted fault and the top of the Ellenburger Group. These map\u2010view fault traces were extruded to fault planes by applying an average dip angle normal to the trend of each fault line following the methodology of Horne et al., 2022. Geologically native stability of these four faults can be described by slip tendency (Ts, or the ratio of resolved shear to normal stress on any plane surface as defined by Morris et al., 1996), which represents the likelihood that a fault will slip under a given set of conditions. Each fault is treated as a set of triangular facets to capture variability in slip tendency over its area, as faults are not generally planar. We use triangulated surfaces of the faults because, although not unique 3D surface representations, they are an efficient and widely used method for such representations. We opted to generate non\u2010planar surfaces to capture whatever non\u2010planar fault geometry exists, which is an important component in determining how, where, and over what rupture areas seismic events may occur. Areas of the fault with high Ts will be more likely to slip, as will faults with a higher average Ts. Fault stability is also characterized by the pore pressure from the ambient state that will cause a fault surface to reach criticality (\u0394Pfc) (Morris et al., 2016, 2021; Zoback, 2007), which is equal to the critical value of friction. Here, we assume a critical friction of 0.6, providing a consistent representation of relative fault stability and allowing comparison to modeled pore pressure changes with deep injection. 4. Results 4.1. Geology of Deep Injection Strata More than 80% of deep injection in the DB is into Late Ordovician, Silurian, and Devonian age strata including the Montoya, Fusselman, Wristen, and Thirtyone Formations; this injection interval is bounded by the low\u2010 permeability Woodford Formation at its top and the Simpson Group at its base. Elevation at the top of the deep injection interval ranges from 0.5 km above MSL in the western DB and on the CBP to more than 5 km below MSL in the basin center, deepest proximal to the CBP (Figure 5a). The present\u2010day structure of these units reflects basement\u2010rooted reverse faults bounding the DB to the east and offsetting the injection units, and the east\u2010 west trending GFZ at the southern boundary of the model domain. The thickness of this deep (Siluro\u2010Devonian) injection unit ranges from 75 m (250 ft) on the western and southern boundaries of the study area to \u223c700 m (2,250 ft) toward the northeast in Lea Co., NM (Figure 5b). The average thickness in the study area is 380 m (1,250 ft) and is a product of localized erosion in the northern part of the CBP. Apart from this localized thinning, the greatest depositional thickness of the injection units is north of the Silurian\u2010 age platform margin, as inferred from thickness trends and facies distributions. Northwest of this inferred margin and covering the modeled area, dolomite is the dominant mineral, averaging from 50 to 72 vol.% in the logged deep (Silurian\u2010Devonian) section (Figures 6 and 7a).

Of secondary importance, the Ordovician\u2010age injection interval consisting of the Ellenburger and Simpson Groups (Table S4 in Supporting Information S1) is defined at its base by the top of the Precambrian basement, which ranges from 1.5 km below MSL to the north and west to more than 6 km below MSL to the east, with similar structural trends to those observed for the Siluro\u2010Devonian section. Thickness of this injection interval ranges from 150 m (500 ft) in the northwest to more than 1,000 m (3,000 ft) in the southeast (Figure S10a in Supporting Information S1), with a regional average thickness of 560 m (1,860 ft), and an average thickness of 290 m (960 ft) in the study area. Ellenburger Group mineralogy is dominantly dolomite and limestone, with the dolomite fraction being the most abundant (Figures 6 and 7a).

Because very few wells log the complete stratigraphic section from Precambrian basement to Simpson Group, charac- terizing the spatial trends in lithology of the Ordovician disposal unit is challenging and mineral proportions averaged by well are not predictable across the basin. Injection into Pennsylvanian\u2010age units accounts for 16% of deep injection in the DB. The depth of Pennsylvanian\u2010 age units ranges from 600 m (1,900 ft) below MSL to the west in Culberson Co., TX and Eddy Co., NM to deeper than 3,000 m (9,800 ft) below MSL in Loving Co., TX (Figure S11 in Supporting Information S1). The Penn- sylvanian disposal is 150 m (500 ft) thick toward the south and north to more than 1,000 m (3,500 ft) to the east (Figure S10b in Supporting Information S1), and averages 520 m (1,700 ft) in the study area. The Pennsylvanian disposal unit is a mixed carbonate\u2010siliciclastic system and is calcite\u2010dominated throughout most of the study area, with less abundant quartz and clay transitioning to quartz\u2010 and clay\u2010dominated in the southwest. Porosity and permeability values computed here are low\u2014representing the rock matrix\u2014compared to fracture\u2010 enhanced permeability values in measured data. Matrix porosity values as interpreted by petrophysical modeling are uniformly less than 5 vol% in carbonate\u2010dominated units including those of Ordovician, Silurian and Devonian age (Figure 7b, Figure S12a in Supporting Information S1).

Because log\u2010based methods for determining porosity\u2014and therefore permeability\u2014do not reliably capture fracture porosity and permeability, flow model calibration using injectivity and field permeability is a key step in determining the overall permeability field. 4.2.

Although pressure can be extracted from any of the 20 layers in the model, we take the middle of the Silurian\u2010Devonian injection unit as Figure 6.

A maximum annual increase in the rate of change in pore pressure was reached in 2021\u20132022 when \u0394Pp had increased by more than 3.4 MPa (500 psi) (Figures 9a and 9b). In the main deep injection interval, pore pressure increased by an average of 0.6 MPa (87 psi) as of the beginning of 2023, with average annual increases of 0.07 MPa (\u223c10 psi) per year in 2019\u20132021, and an average pressure increase of 0.2 MPa (30 psi) in 2022 (Figure 9a). Pressure increase is greatest proximal to injection wells, with smaller perturbations away from injection centers due to pressure diffusion. Pressure buildup also shows high vertical variance (Figures S13a\u2013S13c in Supporting Information S1) due to preferential injection into formations with greater injection capacity and better reservoir quality, and due to pressure diffusion being greatest in the downward direction. For deeper strata, for example, the Ordovician\u2010age Ellenburger Group directly above basement, \u0394Pp ranges from 0 to 5.5 MPa (0\u2013805 psi), averaging 0.55 MPa (80 psi) (Figure S13a in Supporting Information S1), which is on the same order as that of the main Silurian\u2010Devonian injection interval (Figure S13b in Supporting Information S1). Up\u2010section, \u0394Pp in the Pennsylvanian\u2010age for- mations ranges from 0 to 1.85 MPa (0\u2013268 psi), averaging 0.34 MPa (50 psi) (Figure S13c in Supporting In- formation S1), which is 40% lower than in deeper strata. This is likely related to low Kv/Kh ratios modeled for Devonian and Mississippian shale strata, which separate injection intervals from overlying Pennsylvania strata, and the degree of lithologic similarity and hydrologic connectivity between carbonates of Ordovician, Silurian and Devonian age. Results of the sensitivity analysis (described in Text S1, Figures S14a\u2013S14h, Table S3 in Supporting Information S1) show that horizontal permeability has the largest impact on pressure buildup, with a larger RMSE than other parameters. History matching of modeled BHP and BHP estimated from field data for a few wells (Figure S15a\u2013S15d in Supporting Information S1) shows a good match (calculated RMSE ranging from 2.8 to 4.1 MPa, 400\u2013600 psi). Cases run to assess the impact of anisotropy in the permeability field aligned with SHmax show only a modest difference in \u0394Pp trends (Figure S16 in Supporting Information S1). Cases run to attempt to push faults to criticality based on fault stability analysis included doubling all current injection volumes and decreasing compressibility by an order of magnitude (Table S3 in Supporting Information S1); these resulted in increased pore pressure along faults of interest but not of the magnitude to push them to slip based on current character- ization of faults and stress. While little downhole pressure data is available to assess the accuracy of the model, BHP measurements in the Eddy\u2010Lea County line area of NM track an increase in pore pressure gradient of 0.68 kPa/m (0.03 psi/ft) from 2018 to 2022, which is equivalent to 3.45 MPa (500 psi) at average Silurian\u2010Devonian injection depths of \u223c5,300 m (17,500 ft) in this region (Figure S17a in Supporting Information S1). Although comparison of modeled \u0394Pp to single BHP measurements is challenging because BHP measurements are taken for one location at one point in time, the trend of increasing regional modeled \u0394Pp of several hundred psi (Figure S17b in Supporting Information S1) is consistent with an increase in BHP measurements in the northern DB. 4.3. Pore Pressure and Seismicity Sampling of \u0394Pp at each earthquake epicenter and time in the deep injection interval (Figures 9d and 9e) shows that earthquakes proximal to deep injection, that is, in NM, occur at an average modeled \u0394Pp of 0.80 MPa (116 psi), and range from 0 to more than 4 MPa (0\u2013640 psi) (Figure 9e). In contrast, earthquakes in the CMEZ that occur at greater distances from deep injection, including the largest magnitude events, were induced at modest pore pressure increases averaging 0.06 MPa (8.5 psi), with range from 0 to more than 3 MPa (0\u2013462 psi) as currently modeled (Figure 9d). The maximum earthquake magnitude in this region increased over the study period, with the largest event to\u2010date occurring in late 2022 (Figure 9c). Modeled \u0394Pp sampled on five recently seismogenic faults (Figure 10a) shows a wide range of \u0394Pp associated with earthquake occurrence, from as little as 7 kPa (1 psi) to more than 1 MPa, indicating variability in stability among the faults and portions of faults hosting earthquakes in this region. Earthquakes occurring on two faults proximal to deep injection (NM1 and NM2) were initiated at modeled \u0394Pp of 0.2\u20131.7 MPa (30\u2013230 psi), averaging 0.65 MPa (95 psi) for events cataloged by TexNet (Figures 10b and 10c). Fault NM1 experienced the greatest \u0394Pp, and at earthquake sequence onset it had experienced \u0394Pp of 0.78 MPa (113 psi) for events cataloged by NMT, and 0.87 MPa (127 psi) for events cataloged by TexNet (Figure 10b).

This fault hosted several episodes of seismicity associated with larger magnitude events, one in early 2020 related to the ML 4.9 \u201cMentone\u201d event, and another in late 2021 associated with an ML 4.0 event. These temporally delineated episodes of seismicity consist of aftershocks associated with the larger magnitude events, and one possible explanation for their isolated occurrence is local variations in stressing rate associated with variability in injection rate from the nearest deep injection wells to the northwest (Figure 10a). Earthquakes on CMEZ2 occurred after a steady increase in \u0394Pp reached \u223c0.3 MPa (40 psi) as sampled from deep injection strata at earthquake epicentral locations (0.37 MPa at mapped fault center as shown in Figure 10e) and continued at a low rate over several years after an initial several\u2010month period of seismicity (Figure 10e). Seismicity on CMEZ3 (Figure 10f) began with an isolated pulse of earthquakes in mid\u20102018, increasing in frequency from 2020, and further increasing in 2022, resulting in the ML 5.4 \u201cCoalson Draw\u201d event, which is one of the largest earthquakes recorded in this region. Nearly 1,000 earthquakes occurred on faults in this local CMEZ3 area through the end of 2022, with magnitudes ranging from 0.9 to 5.4. Clustering analysis results in the identification of two clusters; however, improvements in earthquake catalog resolution and in the precision of locations would likely increase the number of distinct clusters. Analysis of the spatiotemporal evolution of earthquake clusters shows that in some cases, migration of seismicity along strike (Figures 11a and 11b) and to greater depths (Figures 11c and 11d) occurs. In these cases, the earliest earthquakes occurred along portions of the fault that experienced the greatest \u0394Pp (Figure 10a). Notably, seis- micity experienced on NM2 (Figures 11a and 11c) as cataloged by TexNet occurs in two spatio\u2010temporally isolated phases. The earlier documented seismicity occurred on the NE portion of the fault, and later seis- micity occurred on the southwestern portion of the fault. As presently mapped, this fault consists of one continuous segment with a slight jog in trend. This jog in the fault may represent a breached relay structure between two formerly isolated faults, which merged as deformation progressed during fault formation. In this case, the northeasterly portion of NM2 is activated first, followed by the southwesterly segment, and seismicity does not extend across the relay in either instance. In the case of CMEZ1, migration of seismicity to greater depths is consistent with the greatest \u0394Pp occuring where faults intersect the deep injection intervals and with pressure diffusion along the basement\u2010rooted fault. 4.4. Fault Stability Stability of the five representative faults as 3D surfaces calculated using all possible stress tensors applicable in their locations can be visualized as the cumulative fault area that has a given pore pressure required to push it to fault criticality (\u0394Pfc) (Figure 12), with faults plotting toward the left having a greater area that may slip at lower pore pressure changes. The faults most proximal to deep injection (NM1 and NM2) on the Eddy and Lea County line, trend NE\u2010SW and dip toward the SE (fault characteristics described in Table 1). The stress state in this area and its uncertainty are represented by nine possible stress tensors, which are points on a continuum of possible stress states (Figure S18 in Supporting Information S1, Table 1), with SHmax azimuth ranging from 045\u00b0 to 080\u00b0 and A\u03c6 of 0.325\u20130.5 (Morris et al., 2021). The stability for both faults NM1 (Figure 12a) and NM2 (Figure 12b) has a narrow range even with uncertainty in the stress field A\u03c6 and the azimuth of SHmax. As expected from earthquake occurrence and its experienced \u0394Pp, NM2 has a greater fault area that is unstable at lower \u0394Pp than NM1. Faults CMEZ1, CMEZ2, and CMEZ3 are located within the CMEZ. These faults have hosted earthquakes with recorded magnitudes ranging from 0.1 to 5.4, including the ML 4.9 \u201cMentone\u201d event in March 2020 and the ML 5.4 \u201cCoalson\u201d event in November 2022.

Because the strikes of CMEZ1 and CMEZ2 differ at 064\u00b0 and 101\u00b0, respectively, they are least stable under differing SHmax azimuth conditions. Modeled \u0394Pp along both CMEZ1 and CMEZ2 compared to \u0394Pfc (Figures 12c and 12d) shows that either these faults are much less stable than currently understood or that the actual \u0394Pp is higher than Figure 10.

As currently interpreted, CMEZ3, the fault hosting the ML 5.4 \u201cCoalson Draw\u201d event appears to be stable in all possible stress tensors (Figure 12e) but nevertheless has slipped at modest modeled \u0394Pp. 5. Discussion 5.1. Injection Geology The pore pressure response of the strata we model is governed conceptually by three overlapping flow systems: (a) original matrix and matrix altered by diagenetic processes, (b) structural elements including fractures and faults, and (c) dynamic modification of the first two systems due to processes coupled to the pore pressure change. This third flow system includes poroelastic modification of the matrix and enhancement of permeability along fractures and faults, governed by the slip criticality of each, which may change dynamically with \u0394Pp. The pore pressure response of the matrix (flow system one) is controlled by distributions of thickness, lithology, and flow properties, which are a function of depositional environment and post\u2010depositional diagenetic processes including exposure during relative sea\u2010level lowstands, dolomitization, and karstification. Reservoir quality\u2014namely fluid storage (porosity) and flow (permeability) properties\u2014is directly related to the abundance of dolomite, with dolomite having increased porosity and permeability relative to limestone, as observed both in this study and others (Harrington & Ruppel, 2019; Ruppel, 2019b). This finding also parallels what Smye et al. (2019) found in their geological characterization of lower Paleozoic carbonate strata used for deep injection in the Fort Worth Basin. The dolomite fraction in Silurian and Devonian injection strata is greatest in the northern and northeastern DB; given its prevalence in shallower water platform areas, this is likely a function of more frequent exposure of the platform, and potentially prolonged (\u223c20 m.y.) exposure during the Middle Devonian (Entzminger & Loucks, 1992). Silurian platform margin paleogeography influenced thickness and facies distributions from the Late Silurian to the Devonian. The position of this platform margin appears to be controlled by the Grenville orogenic front, where a basement domain boundary likely acted as a zone of crustal weakness controlling the subsidence rate.

Reservoir quality\u2014namely fluid storage (porosity) and flow (permeability) properties\u2014is directly related to the abundance of dolomite, with dolomite having increased porosity and permeability relative to limestone, as observed both in this study and others (Harrington & Ruppel, 2019; Ruppel, 2019b). This finding also parallels what Smye et al. (2019) found in their geological characterization of lower Paleozoic carbonate strata used for deep injection in the Fort Worth Basin. The dolomite fraction in Silurian and Devonian injection strata is greatest in the northern and northeastern DB; given its prevalence in shallower water platform areas, this is likely a function of more frequent exposure of the platform, and potentially prolonged (\u223c20 m.y.) exposure during the Middle Devonian (Entzminger & Loucks, 1992). Silurian platform margin paleogeography influenced thickness and facies distributions from the Late Silurian to the Devonian. The position of this platform margin appears to be controlled by the Grenville orogenic front, where a basement domain boundary likely acted as a zone of crustal weakness controlling the subsidence rate.

Although injection strategies are driven by operational considerations including proximity to produced water sources and acreage positions, deep injection in the DB occurs in areas where reservoir quality\u2014namely, porosity and permeability\u2014of these intervals is likely highest. However, characterization of matrix porosity and permeability is insufficient to fully understand the flow of injected fluid and associated perturbation of pore pressure because it does not account for the role of larger\u2010scale fracture networks and transmission along faults, necessitating careful model calibration using measured pressure data from injection wells. Furthermore, the nature of the basement and basement\u2010sediment interface is unknown in this region due to the lack of deep well penetrations; this adds uncertainty to attempts to characterize pressure diffusion in basal sedimentary and basement layers in the model.

Faults are an important factor in the flow system, but variations around the high fault permeability values do not control the dynamics of the regional flow system as long as the fault permeability stays high. However, the matrix permeability and the stochastic fault permeability, which includes the effect of fractures on the matrix through enhanced permeability, have a clear impact on the resulting differential pressures. The matrix and mesoscale fault horizontal permeability controls differential pressure and its highest values because injection wells are typically located away from major faults, as shown in this study. Based on this prior work, we conclude that it would be of value to implement stochastic discrete fracture and fault permeability systems in the flow model presented here when sufficient information is available to populate and calibrate the model. Then, the implementation of the dynamic coupling of evolving fault stress criticality and fault perme- ability could be considered. 5.2. Pore Pressure Evolution, Fault Stability, and Seismicity Deep injection in the northern DB has increased the native pore pressure state by more than 10% locally (more than 5 MPa \u0394Pp in places), and has resulted in seismicity in two distinct geologic habitats, that is, in proximity to deep injection in NM and distal from (10s of km away from) injection in CMEZ. Rates of earthquakes of both >ML 2.0 and ML 3.0 increased steadily from 2017 through 2021 along with increases in pore pressure associated with deep injection. In 2022, while both injection and earthquake rates increased, the rate of increase slowed. Within the CMEZ region, the monthly rate of earthquakes is not directly related to the monthly rate of injection (Figure 13a), with monthly injection rates of 8 or more million barrels corresponding to the full range of monthly earthquake rates, from <50/month of ML 2.0+ to nearly 300. In this system, once pore pressure increases from regional deep injection were sufficient to cause fault rupture, earthquake rates remained elevated even when injection rates for the closest wells were decreased. In contrast, when considering all deep injection in the northern DB region, the monthly rate of injection and the monthly rate of earthquakes are exponentially related, with injection rates of 50 MMbbl/month and above corresponding to strong increases in earthquake rate.

Most of these events occur in areas without mapped basement\u2010rooted faults, but even events occurring early in the earthquake monitoring history (e.g., in 2017) occurred at \u0394Pp of up to 1.4 MPa (200 psi). The frequency of events in NM has increased with increasing regional pore pressure associated with deep injection and a greater geographic region impacted by \u0394Pp; however, most earthquakes are still occurring at modeled \u0394Pp of 0\u20132.0 MPa (0\u2013300 psi), which is evidence of the presence of basement\u2010rooted faults in the impacted area that all likely have similar slip tendency and \u0394Pfc. These findings parallel those of Hennings, Nicot, et al. (2021), who found that seismogenic rupture of well\u2010 oriented faults in the Fort Worth Basin in areas near concentrated injection occurred at \u0394Pp of 0.3 MPa. In contrast, seismicity in the CMEZ region has occurred at modest pore pressure increases of <10 psi on average (Figure 9d). Most events occur in crystalline basement, with the average earthquake hypocentral depth at 3,350 m (11,000 ft) below the basement\u2010sediment interface. As in NM, event frequency has increased in the CMEZ; however, more earthquakes are occurring at greater pore pressure increases compared to in early years (Figure 9d), while the overall geographic footprint of seismicity has not increased. This indicates that highly sensitive faults or portions of faults were pushed to criticality at modest (<0.1 MPa) pore pressure increases, and with continued pore pressure increase in recent years, some faults or portions of faults that were stable at \u0394Pp of Figure 13.

This finding also parallels Hennings, Nicot, et al. (2021), who found that seismogenic rupture of well\u2010oriented faults in the Fort Worth Basin in areas distal to concentrated injection occurred at \u0394Pp of 0.05 MPa, and is consistent with the findings of Tung et al. (2021), who model pore pressure change of 154 kPa (22 psi) for the M5.0 \u201cMentone\u201d event in 2020. Many of the earthquakes in the CMEZ occur on mapped basement\u2010rooted faults, for which native stability can be assessed (Morris et al., 2021) and compared to \u0394Pp. At ambient pore pressure, the least stable fault orientations are those with dips greater than 50\u00b0 that are oriented optimally with respect to the most likely stress tensor field. As currently characterized in terms of their geometry and coefficient of friction, faults in the CMEZ region require pore pressure increases to reach criticality that are on the order of at least 2\u00d7 those currently modeled for deep injection (Figures 12c\u201312e). Either this fault system is much more sensitive than previously understood; \u0394Pp is underpredicted, as would be the case with permeability fields that are too low or compressibility fields that are too high; or stressing from poroelastic coupling serves to drive faults toward failure. While poroelastic stressing, rather than direct pressure diffusion, is found to be a dominant mechanism for induced seismicity in some systems (Goebel & Brodsky, 2018), we find it unlikely that poroelastic coupling could play a dominant role in promoting fault rupture in CMEZ due to consideration of the location and distribution of \u0394Pp, the orientation of seismogenic faults within the in situ stress field, and the observed rupture style. As per Huang et al. (2022), the earthquake style in CMEZ is strongly dominated by normal\u2010slip ruptures on steeply dipping planes with WNW strikes. These rupture planes parallel the interpreted faults in the CMEZ area and are subparallel to the local azimuth of SHmax (Dvory & Zoback, 2021) (Figure 8). The dominant strike of seismogenic faults in the CMEZ is tangential to areas of significant \u0394Pp to the north northeast, and the azimuth of Shmin trends directly toward the areas of greatest nearby \u0394Pp. Therefore, poroelastic stressing from \u0394Pp is likely to cause an increase in the magnitude of Shmin, which would shift the faults away from Coulomb failure. This is consistent with the modeling work of Tung et al. (2021), who show that for the M5.0 \u201cMentone\u201d event, deep injection serves to destabilize faults, and that the pore pressure component of the change in Coulomb failure stress is an order of magnitude larger than and opposite in sign to the poroelastic stress component. This proposition could be further tested numerically using the input data and results of our geomodel and flow model, as provided in the Sup- plementary Data. Pore pressure model scenarios were run to assess whether \u0394Pp values could be made to approach \u0394Pfc for specific faults using any reasonable input parameters. These scenarios included local increases in permeability (\u00d7100, up to >40 darcys) trending toward CMEZ, increases in overall injection rate and volumes through addition of in- jection wells (doubling present injection), and decreasing rock compressibility (/10). While some areas of the CMEZ had a pressure buildup of \u223c0.34 MPa (50 psi) as a result, none of these scenarios resulted in the \u0394Pp required to push faults to criticality given assumptions about fault geometry and stress state. High permeability along critically stressed faults or fracture networks allowing for transmission of fluids or pressure (Townend & Zoback, 2000) to greater distance could also play a role in abundant seismicity in the CMEZ area. This phenomenon was proposed by Gao et al. (2021) and Hennings, Nicot, et al. (2021) as operative in the Fort Worth Basin allowing systems of critically stressed normal faults to transmit \u0394Pp up to 40 km from areas of significant injection to faults that became seismogenic. Given that the geomodel reflects the rock matrix, even when the permeability field in the flow model is adjusted globally using injectivity data, fault and fracture permeability conduits could locally play a role in far\u2010field fluid and pressure migration. Another possibility is that the faults in CMEZ are much more sensitive than previously understood, with lower frictional stability, and slip at \u0394Pp that is on the order of modeled results. Multiple lines of evidence indicate that observed earthquake sequences are frequently triggered by small perturbations to the Coulomb stress, on the order of tens of kilopascals (Keranen et al., 2014; Peterie et al., 2018; van der Elst et al., 2013; Yeck et al., 2016); these pore pressure increases are also on the order of that observed for triggering of more distal earthquake sequences in the Ellenburger of the Fort Worth Basin (Hennings, Nicot, et al., 2021) and within the range observed here. To assess the potential impact of frictional stability deviating from 0.6, we tested two cases: (a) ambient critical friction (\u03bcc), in which the principal faults and the host rock are considered to have the same value of friction (our default case is \u03bcc = 0.6), and (b) fault friction (\u03bcf), in which we assume that the host rock has a friction value of Geochemistry, Geophysics, Geosystems 10.1029/2023GC011260 SMYE ET AL. 27 of 33 15252027, 2024, 6, Downloaded from https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2023GC011260 by New Mexico Institute Of Mining, Wiley Online Library on [01/04/2025].

See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License 0.6, but the principal faults may experience a lower effective friction value (Figure S21 in Supporting Infor- mation S1). In case (a) the estimate of ambient friction affects the magnitude of the differential stress extant in the rock mass, decreasing the ambient friction can both increase (e.g., faults CMEZ 1 and 2) and decrease (e.g., faults NM1 and 2, and CMEZ3) the stability of faults, depending on the orientation of the fault within the stress field. However, if the principal faults experience effective friction that is lower than the surrounding host rock (nature of fault gouge, lack of asperities; Bedford et al., 2022), reductions in fault friction decrease \u0394Pfc values for all five faults considered here, rendering them less stable than predicted by applying the ambient friction to the whole system. Low\u2010friction, principal faults may not reduce the rock mass strength by incremental slipping, as predicted by critical friction theory (Townend & Zoback, 2000), because of the presence of fault cohesion that has developed over the millions of years since the faults were last active. In this scenario, small events within the fault zone are likely to have been generated by early anthropogenic pore pressure increases localized on the fault, triggering small cohesion\u2010reducing events. This would have the cumulative effect of destroying cohesion and linking slippable surfaces, culminating in larger events. Notably, there are several regions (e.g., northern Culberson Co. TX, Eddy Co., NM) with mapped basement\u2010 rooted faults that are not slipping seismically at elevated pore pressures of several MPa. These faults appear to either be not optimally oriented with respect to SHmax for fault reactivation and/or are not as natively sensitive to rupture as compared to CMEZ and are therefore more stable with pore pressure increases associated with deep injection. 6. Summary Deep injection in the DB primarily targets platform carbonates of Silurian and Devonian age that are up to 700 m (2,250 ft) thick with fluid storage and flow properties that are a function of lithology\u2014specifically, proportions of limestone and dolomite. Lithology and facies distributions are controlled by the development of a Silurian platform margin, the location of which is consistent with a zone of crustal weakening along the Grenville front bisecting the DB. The strata subject to injection are highly complex\u2014heterolithic, diagenetically modified, fractured and faulted. Pore pressure increases with deep injection modeled using detailed injection geology ranging from 0 to 6.5 MPa (0 to 950 psi), with greatest increases proximal to injection centers. Across the model domain, the average pressure increase from January 1983 to January 2023 is 0.6 MPa (87 psi), with the average annual increase greatest (\u223c0.7 MPa or 10 psi per year) in 2019\u20132021. Sensitivity analyses show that the model is most sensitive to horizontal permeability, which is expected as this parameter controls pressure diffusion proximal to injection centers. Earthquakes in NM have experienced pore pressure increases averaging \u223c0.55 MPa (80 psi), as currently modeled. Earthquakes in CMEZ are initiated at much lower \u0394Pp (<0.1 MPa), indicating that either local anisotropy in permeability is present or that the seismogenic basement\u2010rooted faults are much more sensitive than currently understood. The calculated stability of faults shows a strong dependence on their orientation relative to the azimuth of SHmax, and faults hosting notable seismicity appear to be near\u2010optimally oriented for slip. The comprehensive models and data provided here can be used for further mechanistic studies of fault rupture in the northern DB and to understand other systems of seismicity induced by injection in the strata overlying seismogenic basement, such as those currently experienced in the Midland sub\u2010basin of the greater PB.
