With a typical well requiring 1.5 to 16 million gallons of water, there is an increased demand for water in the Permian Basin and concern over the regions ability to meet this demand. This report is an addendum to the 2018 report \u201cWater Resource Assessment in the New Mexico Permian Basin\u201d (SAND2018-12018) to monitor baseline water level and chemistry data established in the original report. Results from this addendum can be used to further understand regional water supply and demands and aid in the BLM\u2019s mission of sustainably meeting the needs of water users while protecting human and environmental health. 5 ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS We would like to thank the staff at the Carlsbad Field Office for performing the field work necessary to complete this report and the Bureau of Land Management for funding this project. 6 CONTENTS 1.

Introduction This addendum expands on the 2018 report \u201cWater Resource Assessment in the New Mexico Permian Basin\u201d (SAND2018-12018) (Lowry et al., 2018), in which the groundwater in the New Mexico area of the Permian Basin was evaluated to examine potential quantity and quality impacts due to regional development activities and provide baseline data from which future changes can be measured and establish a long-term monitoring network within the Basin. According to the New Mexico Oil Conservation Division there are 48,745 wells producing oil or gas in New Mexico as of August 8, 2020. Furthermore, future investment in infrastructure predicted through 2030 could boost New Mexico\u2019s oil production by 358%, natural gas by 106%, and natural gas liquids by 136% (IER, 2020). As the number of wells increase, the demand for water and infrastructure will increase accordingly. This study aims to address the region\u2019s ability to respond to industry demands, while protecting human health and the environment. In this addendum, the water level and quality of select wells located on BLM managed land in three high potential areas (HPAs), which are associated with the Alto Platform, Bone Spring, and Delaware Mountain Group plays, were assessed (Lowry et al., 2018). These HPAs were derived from the Reasonable Foreseeable Development Scenario in which oil and gas plays in Chavez, Lea, Eddy, and Roosevelt counties were ranked on their potential for future development. \u201cHigh\u201d and \u201cVery High\u201d potential areas have the potential to support 50 to 100 and >100 new wells per year, respectively (Engler et al., 2012). A combination of field measurements and laboratory analyses were assessed to establish current conditions and to determine if significant changes have occurred since the previous report. Field measurements include manual and continuous depth-to-water measurements and flowmeter readings in wells equipped with pumps. Water quality samples were also collected from wells, where possible, and samples were sent to Hall Environmental Analysis Laboratories (HEAL) for analysis of total dissolved solids (TDS) and total anion/cation balance, with some wells also tested for total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH). The data are presented herein and compared to 2018 data, where applicable, with any trends and outliers being noted. 2. Water Quality Basic water quality parameters were analyzed on samples collected from thirteen wells and the results were compared to the 2018 results. The water quality analyses and their associated results are discussed further in the following subsections. 2.1 Sampling Method and Analyses Performed Wells targeted for sampling were selected based on their location and accessibility. Samples were collected from wells via outlets from existing pumping equipment or with a downhole bailer. Examples of pre-existing equipment include wind-powered pumps (Windmills), such as at S-2016-063 and S-2016-097 wells, or hose spigots. To collect a representative sample, water was allowed to flow from the spigots for about five minutes prior to sample collection. Ten of the wells sampled were collected using the bailer method and three were collected utilizing existing well equipment. The following parameters were analyzed by HEAL: pH Specific Conductance (Sp. Cond.) Total Dissolved Solids Calcium (Ca2+) Magnesium (Mg2+) Sodium (Na+) Potassium (K+) Chlorine (Cl-) Bicarbonate (HCO3-) Carbonate (CO3-) Sulfate (SO42+) Fluoride (F-) Nitrate (NO3-) Nitrite (NO2-) In addition, TPH was also analyzed in select samples. HEAL is located in Albuquerque, New Mexico, and holds certifications for drinking water chemical and drinking water microbiological analysis from the State of New Mexico Environment Department. 12 2.2 General Water Quality in the Area Wells sampled in this study are either completed or open to the Rustler Formation, which includes the Culebra and Magenta Aquifers, and/or the Dockum Formation, which includes the Dewey Lake and Santa Rosa Aquifers. The 2018 study included assessments of wells completed in the Pecos and Capitan Reef Aquifers; however, the Water Quality section of this addendum does not include any of those wells. Waters completed in these aquifers are often high in salinity \u2013 primarily sourced from salts such as sodium chloride and calcium sulfate \u2013 with higher salinity reaching concentrations of 35,000 milligrams per liter to the east of the Pecos River and fresher water to the west (Houston et. al. 2015; NMOSE, 2016). Shallow groundwater quality can be very good (i.e., fresher) but degrades as the presence of salt, gypsum, and other evaporite deposits increase at lower depths (NMOSE, 2016). Total dissolved solids concentration is a primary indicator of the regions water quality; water with high TDS is less suitable for drinking or irrigation. Table 1, below, presents the TDS concentrations typically seen in the main aquifers in the HPAs (Lowry et al., 2018): Table 1: Typical TDS ranges of the aquifers within the HPAs Aquifers in HPAs Aquifer Material Typical TDS Range (mg/L) Pecos Alluvium <200 to 10,000 Rustler (includes Culebra and Magenta) Carbonates and Evaporites <1,000 to 4,600 Dockum (includes Dewey Lake and Santa Rosa) Sandstone and Conglomerates <5,000 to >10,000 Capitan Reef Dolomite and Limestone 300 to >5,000 2.3 Water Quality Compared to Standards Water quality data were compared to the New Mexico Water Quality Control Commission (NMWQCC) standards for groundwater with a TDS concentration of 10,000 mg/L or less (NMAC, 2021). The water quality parameters that have applicable NMWQCC standards include pH, TDS, Cl-, SO42-, F-, and NO3 + NO2. 2.3.1 Data from 2019 samples Table 2, below, includes the mean and range of the sample results for each HPA along with the applicable NMWQCC standard. A summary of the results is below: Exceedances of TDS and SO42- were recorded in all wells in the Center North and South HPAs All wells in the Center North HPA and five in the South HPA reported exceedances of Cl- One well in the Center North and one in the South HPA recorded exceedances in F- Exceedances in NO2 + NO3 were recorded in one well in the Center North and one well in the South HPA matched the NMWQCC exceedance standard of"

Cond. Stands for specific conductance Figures 3 and 4 represent the cation/anion bar graphs and TDS plots for the thirteen samples collected in 2019. The percent error in TDS was determined using the measured TDS and calculated TDS from HEAL reports. Well N-2016-081 displays a large charge balance error (47%) in cation/anion ratios, which per HEAL is likely because of suspended particles in the sample. During sampling, indications of a dead animal in the well were identified, which would cause increased suspended solids and could influence the results. Also, the unusual cation/anion ratios might indicate that there are sulfur-reducing bacteria aiding decomposition which reduce sulfate ions to hydrogen sulfide and bicarbonate ions as seen in Equation 1 (Webb, 1998). This would explain the sharp spike in HCO3 and lack of SO4 seen. 19 Equation 1: \ud835\udc366\ud835\udc3b12\ud835\udc426 +3\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc422\u2015 4 \u21923\ud835\udc3b2\ud835\udc46+ 6\ud835\udc3b\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc42\u2015 3 The presence of a dead animal provides an abundance of carbon material and make it an ideal environment for the growth of sulfur-reducing bacteria (Riefler, 2008).

This includes nineteen wells in the North HPA, eleven wells in the Center North HPA, and forty-two wells in the South HPA. Of the thirteen wells sampled in 2019 and eleven sampled in 2020, eight wells were sampled in the original 2018 SAND2018-12018 Report and sampled again in both 2019 and 2020 with an additional one sampled only in 2019. Table 8 presents the results from the common wells sampled from 2018 to 2020. Observations of significant changes in the water chemistry of the wells are presented below: Total anion count in N-2016-081 Well (North HPA) doubled from 2016 to 2019 Specific conductance for CN-2015-013 (Center North HPA) experienced a sharp decrease (53500 \u00b5mhos/cm to 4500 \u00b5mhos/cm) from 2016 to 2019 then nearly doubled its original value in 2020 TDS, total cation count, and total anion count for CN-2015-013 all decreased from 2016 to 2019 then returned to their original value in 2020 The pH of S-2016-019 increased above NMWQCC standards from 2019 to 2020 25 Table 8: Results of common wells sampled from 2018 to 2020 with an additional well sampled only in 2019.

The well was initially sampled on June 28, 2016 and was resampled on August 20, 2019 and June 6, 2020. A possible source of the discrepancy, particularly in the TDS data, may come from the depth at which the samples were collected. In 2016 and 2020 the samples were collected at 200 ft below top of container (BTOC) whereas samples were collected at 100 ft BTOC in 2019. Samples with lower TDS levels will be less dense and therefore be higher in the water column, as seen in 2019. Increases in NO3 and NO2 could indicate the presence of artificial fertilizers, agricultural waste, septic systems, and animal waste. Because nitrogen moves slowly in groundwater, there can be delays in subsurface groundwater response to changes in nitrogen at the surface so the exact source cannot be determined at this point (WHO, 2011).

This well is adjacent to and representative of S-2016-019 and drilled to the same depth; however, S-2016-019 was inaccessible at the time of sampling. These wells are in an area of heavy development and were at one time part of a waterflood unit. The source of this increase was unable to be determined. When considering the changes in fluoride levels, it is important to note that given the small amount of initial fluoride present (typically 0 to 2 mg/L), any change in concentration will result in a larger percent change. 3. Water Level Data Twenty-seven wells in the three HPAs and the Capitan Reef area were surveyed for water level data from 2016 to 2020. Water level data for all wells were collected manually and nine wells were tested continuously into 2020. Continuous water level monitoring is preferred; however, manual measuring can provide a general view of water levels while being less expensive and requiring less equipment. Manual monitoring does not capture the high- frequency fluctuations in water level and will not capture rapid fluctuations due to pumping activity. Continuous water level monitoring is done using pressure-head gauges and barometric pressure gauges. These pressure transducer gauges consist of a temperature sensor, pressure transducer, and data logger and data from these transducers is corrected using data from the barometric pressure gauges (Johnson, 2019). Continuous water depth data shows the frequent fluctuations in depth that manual data collection cannot. An outline of the wells monitored is shown in Table 11.

This number includes wells from the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant that were monitored for the 2018 report 32 The wells monitored are completed to three distinct hydrostatic units: the Rustler formation, Santa Rosa/Dewey Lake formation, and the Capitan Reef formation. The number of wells in each unit is shown in Table 12 and a map provided in figure 13. Table 12: Number of wells completed in the three major aquifers for each HPA.

Of the three Center North wells drilled to the Rustler formation, one shows nearby pumping activity while two indicated changes in water level due to barometric and seasonal fluctuations. Two wells known to be drilled to the Dewey Lake/Santa Rosa formation indicate a recharge of the aquifer. A third adjacent well drilled to an unknown formation shows a similar trend indicating that it is likely drilled to the Dewey Lake/Santa Rosa formation as well. The final two wells show the opposite trend and water level has been steadily declining since first tested. Of the thirteen wells drilled in the South HPA: o One drilled to the Rustler formation was continuously monitored and did not show evidence of nearby pumping and is indicative of barometric and seasonal effects. Two showed steady declines in water level starting in mid-2016. The remaining five drilled to the Rustler formations showed fluctuations that could be indicative of nearby pumping, but it is difficult to determine for certain without continuous data. o Four wells are drilled to the Dewey Lake/Santa Rosa aquifer. One was continuously monitored and showed nearby pumping that stopped in early 2018; the well has been recharging since. Manual monitoring for three adjacent wells shows a similar trend. o The final well is drilled to an unknown aquifer, however its proximity to the wells drilled to the Dewey Lake/Santa Rosa aquifer and similar water level trend suggest that it is drilled to the same aquifer. All four wells in the Capitan Reef were continuously monitored. Two wells indicated nearby pumping while two show a recharge of the aquifer since monitoring began in 2012. 3.1 North HPA Water Level Data The two wells monitored in the North HPA were N-2016-081 and N-2016-078. Both wells are drilled to the Rustler formation. N-2016-081 well was monitored both manually and continuously with data collected in one-hour intervals. Water levels in the well fluctuated only slightly as seen in the previous report but has an overall downward trend. N-2016-078 is a domestic well for one household. Manual data showed a large drop in water level from February 10, 2017 to October 2, 2017. Notes from February 10,"

Manual data showed a large drop in water level from February 10, 2017 to October 2, 2017. Notes from February 10, 2017 indicate that the well was in operation which may explain the decreases in water level. Continuous data would help to further support if this drop was a result of well operation or natural fluctuation in the groundwater level. Manual water level data is shown in Table 13. 34 Figure 40: Manual and continuous data for N-2016-081. The small changes in depth and constant fluctuations indicate that changes are the result of barometric and seasonal effects. Figure 41: Manual data for N-2016-078. This is a residential well with a pump installed and fluctuations indicate the pump being used.

Both CN-2016-005 and CN-2015-013 were monitored manually and continuously; data from continuous monitoring was collected every four hours. Continuous data for well CN-2016-005 is typical of nearby pumping. Measurements from CN-2015-013 are indicative of barometric and seasonal effects. Figure 42: Manual and continuous data for CN-2015-013.

The large fluctuations are likely due to active drilling, pumping, or injection near the well. Figure 44: Manual data from CN-2015-012. There is an overall decrease in water level however the cause cannot be determined. Continuous monitoring must be used to determine if this trend is due to pumping activity or natural fluctuations. Wells CN-2016-001 and CN-2016-003 are both drilled to the Santa Rosa/Dewey Lake formation. Well CN-2016-001 was reporting an increase in water level, however, when more measurements were made on May 15, 2019, the well was blocked and no reading was collected. Similarly, on June 18, 2020 it was reported that CN-2016-003 had collapsed and no more measurements could be made. This increase in water level indicates a recharge of the aquifer. 3280.00 3281.00 3282.00 3283.00 3284.00 3285.00 3286.00 3287.00 3288.00 12/27/2014 1/31/2016 3/6/2017 4/10/2018 5/15/2019 6/18/2020 7/23/2021 Center North HPA: CN-2016-005 Water Leverl (ft ASML) 3195.40 3195.50 3195.60 3195.70 3195.80 3195.90 3196.00 3196.10 3196.20 3196.30 3196.40 3196.50 1/31/2016 3/6/2017 4/10/2018 5/15/2019 6/18/2020 7/23/2021 Center North HPA: CN-2015-012 Water Level (ft AMSL) 37 Figure 45: Manual data from CN-2016-001.

These wells include: S-2016-048, S- 2016-063, S-2016-097, S-2016-096, S-2016-050, S-2016-055, S-2016-082, and S-2016-045. Of these wells, S-2016- 048 was continuously monitored on a four-hour interval. The well is privately owned, and the erratic nature of the continuous data is indicative of pumping cycles associated with small community water supply. Both wells S-2016-097 and S-2016-055 have shown a steady downwards trend since mid-2017. The NMWRRS lists the primary purpose for S-2016-097 and S-2016-055 as livestock watering and prospecting or development of a natural resource, respectively. Figure 50: Manual and continuous data for S-2016-048 well. This well is located near a municipal water supply and the erratic nature of continuous data is consistent with small community water supply. 3040 3042 3044 3046 3048 3050 3052 3054 3056 3058 3060 3062 1/31/2016 3/6/2017 4/10/2018 5/15/2019 6/18/2020 7/23/2021 South HPA: S-2016-048 Water Level (ft AMSL) 42 Figure 51: Manual data for S-2016-097 shows a steady decrease in water level Figure 52: Manual water level for S-2016-055 indicates a decrease in water level starting in mid-2017. 3576.80 3577.00 3577.20 3577.40 3577.60 3577.80 3578.00 3578.20 3578.40 3578.60 3578.80 8/18/2016 6/14/2017 4/10/2018 2/4/2019 12/1/2019 9/26/2020 7/23/2021 South HPA: S-2016-097 Water Level (ft AMSL) 2815.00 2815.50 2816.00 2816.50 2817.00 2817.50 2818.00 2818.50 2819.00 1/31/2016 3/6/2017 4/10/2018 5/15/2019 6/18/2020 7/23/2021 South HPA: S-2016-055 Water Level (ft AMSL) 43 FIGURE 53: MANUAL DATA FOR S-2016-063.

This well was previously used for commercial pumping but is now only used for livestock watering. Wells S-2016-019, S-2016-023, and S-2016-020 are all drilled to the Santa Rosa/Dewey Lake formation and located within half a mile of one another. They all share the same general trend indicative of pumping in mid-2017 followed by recovery. It was reported that water was being pumped nearby on December 20, 2017 which explains the decrease observed. The wells are listed for commercial use. Well S-2017-004 is also drilled to the Santa Rosa/Dewey Lake aquifer and was continuously monitored on a four- hour interval. This well is permitted for livestock watering and has operating wells nearby. Early continuous data shows the decrease and rebound in water level as a result of the pumping, however, pumping seems to have ceased in early 2018.

Continuous data indicates that pumping occurred from mid-2017 to early 2018 then stopped and the well experienced recharge. Although well S-2016-026 is drilled into an unknown aquifer, it can be assumed that it is also drilled to the Santa Rosa and Dewey Lake aquifer. Well S-2016-026 is located in close proximity to wells S-2016-023, S-2016-019, and S-2016-020 and exhibits the same general trends as these wells. Figure 62: Manual water level data for S-2016-026. This well is located near S-2017-004, S-2016-023, S-2016-019, and S-2016-020 and exhibits similar trends suggesting that S-2016-026 is also drilled to the Dewey Lake/Santa Rosa aquifer.

All wells were monitored manually on a quarterly basis and continuously on one to twelve-hour intervals. CR-2015-002 and CR-2015-001 show a steady decline in water level with daily fluctuations indicative of nearby pumping. The Capitan aquifer is one of the primary sources of domestic water in Eddy County and of water used to enhance oil recovery in surrounding counties in New Mexico and Texas (Richey, 1985). Well CR-2015-001\u2019s shallow depth (average of 20.60 ft BTOC during this study)and karstic nature also make it more influenced by precipitation. Conversely, CR-2015-004 and CR-2015-005 both show steady increases in water level with little daily fluctuations indicating recovery of the aquifer after pumping has stopped. In the Hiss study (Hiss 1973), these wells were declining and it was suspected at the time that it was due to withdrawal of water for industrial purposes. The recent trend shows the opposite and suggest that the aquifer in the eastern part of the Capitan is experiencing recharge. However, the incremental rise in these wells could also be enhanced by injection wells into the Capitan Aquifer coupled with a slow recovery trend. 51 Capitan Reef well CR-2015-005 was removed from the monitoring program due to vandalism of the well noted during one of the scheduled data downloads on 4/17/2019. The pressure transducer was pulled out and laying on the ground nearby. There was also a black oily residue on the water level meter tape when it was brought back to the surface after attempting a manual water level measurement. BLM personnel were notified, and photo documentation was provided. Figure 63: Manual and continual water level data for CR-2015-001. The data indicates that water level changes are likely due to precipitation events, pumping for irrigation purposes, and variations in surface water levels of the Pecos River Figure 64: Manual and continual water level data for CR-2015-002.

Summary and Recommendation Water chemistry and level data were compared to baseline data established in the 2018 SAND2018-12018 report. Water quality samples were collected using bailers or existing pumps and analyzed by Hall Environmental Analysis Laboratory. Thirteen wells completed in or open to the Rustler Formation, which includes the Culebra and Magenta Aquifers, and/or the Dockum Formation, which includes the Dewey Lake and Santa Rosa Aquifers, were sampled for pH, TDS, and cation/anion balance, with nine wells also tested for TPH. Laboratory results were then compared to applicable NMWQCC standards. 56 According to 2019 water quality results, all wells in the Center North and South HPAs recorded exceedances in TDS and SO42- and all wells in the Center North and five wells in the South HPA reported exceedances in Cl-. One well in both the Center North and South HPAs reported exceedances of F- and NO2 + NO3. No wells in the North HPA reported exceedances in standards. Results from the 2020 water quality sampling indicated all wells in the Center North HPA exceeded NMWQCC standards for SO42-, TDS, and Cl-. In the South HPA, all wells exceeded the standards for SO42-, all but one well for TDS, five wells for Cl-, and one well for F-. Two wells in the South HPA had pH values above nine. No TPH was detected above the reporting limits in any of the wells in 2019 or 2020. The total anion count for one well (N-2016-081) in the North HPA doubled from 2016 to 2019. One well in the Center North (CN-2015-013) saw large fluctuations in TDS, specific conductance, total cation, and total anion count. This was likely due to changes in sampling depth from 2016 to 2019. Finally, the pH in one well in the South HPA (S-2016-019) rose to above the NMWQCC standard upper limit of nine in 2020. Water level data were also collected from wells drilled to the Rustler Formation, Dockum Formation, and Capitan Reef. One well in the North HPA showed changes in water level indicative of seasonal variations while another well also in the North HPA showed water level changes associated with nearby pumping. In the Center North HPA one well drilled to the Rustler Formation indicated nearby pumping while two others drilled to the same formation did not show changes associated with pumping activities. Wells known to be drilled to the Dockum formation in the Center North HPA show recharge to the aquifer based on upward trending water levels. A similar trend is seen in the South HPA. Seven of the eight wells in the South HPA completed in the Rustler Formation showed water level responses due to nearby pumping, although it is difficult to determine for certain without continuous monitoring data. The water level in two wells completed to the Capitan Reef Aquifer indicated nearby pumping while two wells also completed in the Capitan Reef Aquifer showed water level increases and possible recharge to the aquifer. It is recommended that field testing be continued to monitor water quality and water level changes in the region. Monitoring for TPH should also continue, particularly in the South HPA where there is an increase in drilling activity. Finally, additional wells can be identified for continuous water level monitoring to augment the existing network, especially where manual water level measurements demonstrate significant increases or decreases in water levels and quarterly data points are not sufficient to determine the cause. 57 5.
