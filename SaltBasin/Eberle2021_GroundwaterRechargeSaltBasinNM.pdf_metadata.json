This groundwater source has been the basis of eleven previous hydrological studies, each of which estimated a groundwater recharge rate. These previous recharge estimates range from 6,000 to 240,000 acre-feet per year (7,000,000 to 300,000,000 m3/yr.). This wide range of recharge estimates makes it dif\ufb01cult to implement a sustainable water-budget plan for the basin. Therefore, the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation has funded this study and [1] in order to constrain the recharge estimates and create a more complete groundwater \ufb02ow model, respectively. This study utilized hydrochemical analyses, the chloride-mass-balance ap- proach, and a New Mexico-speci\ufb01c soil-water-balance model, PyRANA. Hydro- chemical analyses supported previous studies by identifying dedolomitization trends in the New Mexico portion of the Salt Basin. However, the Texas portion of the Salt Basin was found to be geologically and hydrologically more complex. Carbonate facies continue to be the primary aquifer units in the south, but there is also some in\ufb02uence of brines from the Salt Flats in the central basin and extensively fractured facies in the southwest basin. The brines mix with waters that otherwise follow a dedolomitization trend. Fractured carbonates create a two-water mixing system. Young, fresh waters recharge through the fractures and old, high-total- dissolved-solid waters reside in the carbonate matrix. Groundwater sampled from the 1980\u2019s showed evidence of mixing with water containing fallout from the 1950\u2019s and 1960\u2019s atmospheric nuclear weapons tests. Corrected radiocarbon ages support this mixing trend. The Fontes and Garnier method was used to make radiocarbon corrections, with limited certainty. An additional mixing trend between the young and old groundwaters of the southwestern Salt Basin was also explored to make radiocarbon corrections exclusively for the southwestern points. Using the mixing correction, the corrected groundwater ages ranged from 900 years to 26,000 years. Neither radiocarbon correction method resulted in a \ufb02ow path of increasing age that could be used to get a groundwater \ufb02ow velocity. The chloride-mass-balance method was supplemented with chloride-to- bromide ratio measurements to differentiate atmospheric chloride from chloride derived from mineral dissolution in deep basin brines. A mixing curve correction factor was applied to the chloride-to-bromide ratio in groundwater samples to estimate the amount of chloride from atmospheric deposition versus deep basin brine. The atmospheric depositional chloride concentration was divided by the brine-corrected groundwater chloride concentration to determine the fraction of total precipitation remaining in recharged groundwater. Mapping of the resulting fraction of precipitation that becomes recharge facilitated the separation of the overall Salt Basin into sub-watersheds with similar corrected fractions. For the lowland sub-watersheds, the runoff volume estimated by PyRANA was used in place of the total precipitation as the volume of water that could potentially become recharge, but it was assumed to have the same initial chloride concentration as precipitation. The lowland total recharge from the chloride-mass-balance method, in combination with PyRANA runoff estimate, was 5,000 acre-feet per year. In the more humid, mountainous sub-watersheds, the interception- corrected rainfall volume was used as the potential recharge water volume. The mountainous total recharge was 27,000 acre-feet per year. The resulting total corrected chloride-mass-balance method recharge rate for the Salt Basin was 32,000 acre-feet per year. PyRANA used environmental and soil hydraulic parameters to create a soil- water-balance model that also produced an estimated recharge rate. The diffuse recharge estimated by PyRANA was 3,000 acre-feet per year, primarily occurring in the Sacramento Mountains. While the diffuse recharge is a function of precipita- tion, focused recharge is a function of runoff due to overland \ufb02ow up-gradient and in\ufb01ltration through arroyo and wash beds. The fraction of runoff that becomes recharge cannot be estimated by PyRANA and the model predicted zero diffuse recharge in the lowlands. Hence, the lowland total recharge was only predicted by the combined PyRANA runoff and chloride-based recharge fraction method described above: 5,00 acre-feet per year. The mountainous total recharge from PyRANA was found by summing the diffuse recharge and all estimated runoff into the perennial section of the Sacramento River, totaling 8,000 acre-feet per year. The resulting total PyRANA recharge rate for the Salt Basin was 13,000 acre-feet per year. The full range of new recharge estimates generated in this study is 13,000-32,000 acre-feet per year (16,000,000-40,000,000 m3/yr.), which is contained within the range of previous estimates.

Beth Ann Michelle Eberle July 17, 2021 CHAPTER 1 INTRODUCTION 1.1 Background Many semiarid regions are at extreme risk of water supply shortage over the next 30 years as the groundwater and surface water resources are expected to be dramatically reduced due to climate change [3]. These dryland regions account for 40% of Earth\u2019s land surface and contains a third of the Earth\u2019s population [4]. Agriculture in drylands requires a water resource to sustain the 2.5 billion living within these regions and millions more that rely on the agricultural products. The semiarid nature of the drylands ampli\ufb01es the importance of groundwater in maintaining a potable and agricultural water source, since surface water is minimal and usually unpredictable [5]. Groundwater resource sustainability and thus dryland agriculture sustainability has become increasingly relevant to society as the world continues to grow and as climate change continues to strengthen. The stability and quantity of groundwater available for societal use depends upon the incoming and outgoing water of the study basin. Incoming water refers to precipitation and groundwater or surface in\ufb02ow from external basins. Water can leave a basin via evapotranspiration (ET), groundwater or surface out\ufb02ow into external basins, or in the form of agricultural products. A water-budget can be calculated by subtracting all of the outgoing water from the incoming water, with the excess water that enters but does not leave the basin contributing to storage in a groundwater reserve for future use. It is that reserve that needs to be maintained and managed to sustain those who utilize the groundwater. Climate change is becoming increasingly disruptive to management activities aimed at balancing the hydrological system because it can signi\ufb01cantly decrease or increase the amount of water entering and leaving a basin depending upon location [6, 7]. In arid environments, climate change is increasing the average air temperature and typically decreasing the amount of precipitation [6]. These effects make evapotranspiration and droughts more prevalent. With less water entering the basin and more water exiting, there would be a negative impact upon the amount of water entering the groundwater reserve. There are multiple techniques to assess groundwater resources, with one of the foremost being physics-based modeling. A \ufb01nite-difference approach is com- mon to produce a three-dimensional, steady-state and transient model in which complex systems are analyzed [8].

In arid environments, climate change is increasing the average air temperature and typically decreasing the amount of precipitation [6]. These effects make evapotranspiration and droughts more prevalent. With less water entering the basin and more water exiting, there would be a negative impact upon the amount of water entering the groundwater reserve. There are multiple techniques to assess groundwater resources, with one of the foremost being physics-based modeling. A \ufb01nite-difference approach is com- mon to produce a three-dimensional, steady-state and transient model in which complex systems are analyzed [8]. This modeling practice exempli\ufb01es a limitation 1 of physics-based modeling: they require extensive inputs and computational ex- penditure. Physics-based modeling is simpli\ufb01ed in part by pre-developed codes, such as MODFLOW, that reduce the model construction time [1, 8\u201312]. Physics- based models function well to visually map the three- dimensional movement of the water in the study basin. Due to the nature of the estimated inputs, the result- ing models can run simulations for different water-budgets at different temporal scales. Physics-based models are convenient when focusing on the quantity and movement of groundwater resources, but fails to qualify the types of water in the study basin. Assessment of the quantity and quality of groundwater are important when attempting to evaluate the water for potable or agricultural use in a semiarid basin. The second overarching technique to assess the groundwater resource is geochemical analyses. This approach focuses on the geochemistry of the water in the basin, and in doing so, measures the water quality. The relative concentrations of major ions, minor ions, and stable isotopes within the water samples through- out the basin can designate the quality, evolution, age, and potential mixing of the water along the \ufb02ow path [13\u201317]. Environmental tracers are a category of hydrochemical constituents, including many isotopes, that can be used to deter- mine chemical evolution pathways throughout the water system. Stable isotope ratios are expressed in terms of delta values (\u03b4) in units of per mil (\u2030). Delta values represent the relative concentration of a given isotope with respect to the concentration of most abundant base isotope in a sample versus the same ratio of given isotope to base isotope in a standard reference material, all multiplied by 1000 to facilitate comparisons between delta values. The delta value is given by \u03b4\u2217X = ( \u2217Xsample/Xsample \u2217Xstandard/Xstandard \u22121) \u00d7 1000 (1.1) For example, delta oxygen-18 is the concentration of oxygen-18 in the sample over the concentration of oxygen-16 in the sample over the same ratio of isotopes in Standard Mean Ocean Water (SMOW). This ratio of ratios is subtracted by one and multiplied by 1000. The relative delta value can change as the water undergoes fractionation, with an unequal exchange of a given isotope with respect to the abundant base isotope. With some modi\ufb01cation and correction factors, geo- chemistry can be utilized to estimate groundwater recharge based on radioactive carbon-14 or radiocarbon concentrations, along with other chemical components and subsequent analyses [14, 17\u201322]. The major disadvantage of using the geo- chemical analyses technique is the necessity of chemical analyses from well water samples. This hindrance is negligible if the study basin has a well-established historic hydrochemistry database. The water balance approach to evaluating groundwater resources ties closely to the hydrological budget of incoming and outgoing waters. The purpose of the water balance is to comprehensively quantify each in\ufb02ow and out\ufb02ow, as well as any missing components. Each sub-basin contributes a certain amount of water. A simpli\ufb01ed version of the water balance evaluates the groundwater recovery in 2 water wells and assumes that the well recovery volume is equal to recharge [23]. The water balance method is often used to estimate groundwater recharge in hydrologically closed semiarid basins by determining the evapotranspiration leaving the hydrological system [24\u201328]. Despite the precisely estimated inputs used for the water balance, the results are similar to that of a physics-based model; the hydrological system is quanti\ufb01ed, but there is no measure of water quality. The water-budget of semiarid regions is vital to the continued prosperity of those regions where water is a limited resource. As growing urban water use competes with farming in semiarid regions, the groundwater usage needs to be regulated to ensure sustainability. Understanding the extent, quantity, and quality of a hydrological system helps facilitate the creation of a localized water man- agement plan to accurately evaluate the amount of water available for irrigation pumping and potable water usage. The New Mexico Of\ufb01ce of the State Engineer (OSE) Water Rights Division has established multiple water right rules, regula- tions, and guidelines that effectively limit the amount of groundwater pumping to maintain a sustainable water resource for multiple basins and sub-regions within each state [29]. The U.S. Bureau of Reclamation in the western United States funds research into the water-budget of watersheds in order to manage, develop, and protect the water resources within each watershed [30]. In realization of its mission statement and to quantify interstate transfer of wa- ters, the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation has funded an assessment of water resources in the Salt Basin, NM/TX. This project is intended to evaluate the groundwater availability in the Salt Basin, help assess the local sustainability of current ground- water usage, and indicate the implications for future development [31]. The primary research goal of the water-budget component is to narrow the range of previous groundwater recharge estimates. There have been eleven prior estimates of groundwater recharge in the Salt Basin, ranging from 6,000 to 240,000 acre-feet per year, each of which will be explained in further detail later [31]. I hypothesize that the recharge in the Salt Basin is closer to the lower end of that range. By producing accurate and modernized groundwater recharge estimate, the overall water-budget will be enhanced, the most effective water resource management plan can be instituted, and the welfare of the semiarid basin can be sustained. 1.2 Geography The Salt Basin is a 13,000 km2 (5,000 mi2) hydrologically closed basin shared between southeastern New Mexico"

The areal extent of the basin covers parts of Otero, Chaves, and Eddy counties in New Mexico and parts of Hudspeth and Culberson counties in Texas. There are approximately 1,000 residents within the Salt Basin across these \ufb01ve counties [32, 33]. The population centers of the Salt Basin are Timberon, NM, Pi\u02dcnon, NM, Cornudas, TX, and Dell City, TX. The New Mexican communities are located near the northern margin of the Salt Basin and contain approximately 300 and 100 people, respectively [14]. Cornudas and Dell City, TX are along the state-border 3 and account for approximately 400 for each city [32, 33]. The Salt Basin population is sparse. Many of the residents rely on dryland farming and ranching, though groundwater-supplied irrigated agriculture prevails near Dell City. Fort Bliss and the McGregor Range encompasses the eastern margin of the Salt Basin [34]). Figure 1.1: Salt Basin groundwater divide with de\ufb01ning topographic features labeled, cities are labeled and denoted with blue dot, state boundaries are dashed lines, country border is green, county borders are thin, black lines, and Fort Bliss-McGregor Range is highlighted in red crosshatching; Salt Basin colored by elevation with white being high elevation and green being lower elevation Mountainous topography above 1,500 m in elevation comprises approxi- mately 14% of the Salt Basin and is predominately concentrated along the northern and eastern margins. The highest point of the Salt Basin is approximately 2,900 m at Sacramento Peak in the Sacramento Mountains to the north. A majority of the Salt Basin, around 63% of the area, consists of low relief \u2018lowlands\u2019 that range from 1,200 to 1,500 m in elevation, with the high point being in the Otero Mesa/Diablo Plateau in the western Salt Basin. The Cornudas Mountains form an isolated group of peaks that climb steeply to 2,100 m in elevation [14]. The basin\u2019s deepest portions, at about 1,000 m elevation, comprise the remaining 23% of the Salt Basin and form playas known as the Salt Flats near the eastern margin. The hydrological boundary of the Salt Basin is designated by multiple features 4 that are the result of tectonic activity associated with the orogenic events of the Sacramento section of the Basin and Range province [12, 14]. The northern water- shed divide is created by the southern Sacramento Mountains. The Guadalupe, Brokeoff, and Delaware Mountains form the eastern watershed divide of the Salt Basin. To the west, the Salt Basin hydrological boundary is formed on the edge of the Otero Mesa/Diablo Plateau uplift where it transitions into the Tularosa Basin further westward. The southern border of the Salt Basin, as de\ufb01ned by this study, is the groundwater divide created by the Victorio Flexure [35\u201337]. This \ufb02exure effectively restricts groundwater \ufb02ow as it strikes NW-SE on the western portion, adjacent to the Baylor Mountains, and strikes E-W on the eastern portion that is adjacent to the Apache Mountains [35]. This southern boundary has been modi\ufb01ed from the New Mexico Of\ufb01ce of the State Engineer (OSE) designation of the Salt Basin that originally continued farther southward into Texas [14]. 1.3 Climate Southeastern New Mexico and far western Texas are semiarid with a wide range of temperatures. For Dell City, TX the maximum daily temperature ranges from 14 to 37\u00b0C (58 to 99\u00b0F) while the minimum daily temperature ranges from -4 to 18\u00b0C (24 to 64\u00b0F). The average daily temperature for the overall Salt Basin ranges from 5 to 28\u00b0C (41 to 82\u00b0F) [38]. The higher elevations have a naturally cooler climate, averaging between 6 and 10\u00b0C (43 to 50\u00b0F) [14]. According to NOAA\u2019s monthly average climatography for the United States, the Salt Basin receives between 180 to 340 mm per year in the lowlands and between 380 and 900 mm per year in the high elevations of the Sacramento Mountains [17, 39, 40]. Most of this precipitation falls as rain during the monsoon season from May to October [17, 40, 41]. 1.4 Vegetation Natural \ufb02ora in the Salt Basin is elevation dependent and is differentiated based on the EPA\u2019s level IV designation [42]. This classi\ufb01cation system divides the conterminous United States into more than 100 ecoregions based on similarities in topography, ecology, stratigraphy, hydrology, and other such classi\ufb01cations [42]. The higher elevations of the Salt Basin are similar to the Rocky Mountains conifer forests as they share ponderosa pine, Douglas-\ufb01r, and some oak species. Just to the south of the Sacramento Mountain ridges and extending east into the Guadalupe Mountains, the vegetation transitions into the Madrean Lower Montane Wood- lands. In these foothills, there are mixed ponderosa pines, junipers and oak species, and mixed desert grasses. Moving further south and into the Salt Basin, the veg- etation becomes characteristic of Chihuahuan Desert Slopes with mixed desert grasses and desert shrubs. The majority of the Salt Basin is \ufb02at lowlands that are designated Chihuahuan Desert Grasslands. These lowlands are vegetated by 5 mixed desert grasses, desert shrubs, and scattered desert brush. The Salt Flats and southern playas of the Salt Basin are sparsely vegetated around the margins of the playas with desert grasses and desert shrubs that compose the Chihuahuan Basins and Playas designation. Within the playas, there is a lack of vegetation. The last ecoregion of the study area is a small block along the southern margin of the Salt Basin around the Sierra Diablo mountains.

This is the Chihuahuan Mon- tane Woodlands that is comprised of a mix of evergreen conifers, oaks, junipers, ponderosa pine, Douglas-\ufb01r, and desert grasses. Due to the relatively \ufb02at lowlands, frequent sunshine, mild winters, and, foremost, presence of abundant groundwater, there is agricultural activity in the central Salt Basin [14]. The agronomic \ufb02ora is mostly isolated in Dell City, TX and are mostly alfalfa, chiles, and cotton [41, 43]. These crops are common in semiarid environments as they are capable of withstanding the harsh climate with center- pivot and \ufb02ood irrigation [43]. The season for planting and production of alfalfa, chiles, and cotton ranges from April into December [44]. While the entirety of the Salt Basin extends beyond Otero County, NM and the county extends beyond the basin, the agriculture of this county should be representative of the agriculture of the Salt Basin. Livestock in Otero County is predominantly cattle and sheep [44]. Grazing livestock eat the desert grasses and drink the pumped groundwater. 1.5 Geology The geology of the Salt Basin is complex, deformed, and spans many geologic time periods. Sur\ufb01cial geology ages range from Permian to Quaternary while the overall stratigraphic age of the Salt Basin ranges from Precambrian to Quaternary (Figure 1.2; [31]). The most prominent sur\ufb01cial geology in the New Mexico portion of the Salt Basin are also the primary aquifers of the Salt Basin: Permian carbonates (Figure 1.2). These carbonates were deposited in a shelf and shelf-margin ma- rine environment during a period of sea level change due to the evolution of the Delaware Basin during the Guadalupian epoch (Figure 1.3; [31]). The Yeso formation is in the western Salt Basin sur\ufb01cial geological unit. This formation is a heterogeneous stratigraphic unit from the Guadalupian/Leonardian time period that consists primarily of limestones and dolomites interbedded with gyp- sum, siltstone, and shale [14, 31, 45, 46]. The San Andres formation is mapped as \u2018Leonardian, undivided\u2019 in Figure 1.2 and comprises the remainder of the New Mexico sur\ufb01cial geology. This formation is primarily dolomite with intermixed shale beds and sandstones [14, 31, 46]. The Yeso and San Andres formations are equivalent to the Victorio Peak and Bone Spring limestone formations in the Texas portion of the basin [47]. The Victorio Peak limestone becomes the Bone Spring formation as the depositional environment changes from shelf-margin to basin [31, 48]. Both of these units are limestone and dolomite intermixed with siliceous shale and sandstone [23]. All of the carbonate aquifers within the Yeso, 6 .. Figure 1.2: From [31]; Generalized geologic map of the Salt Basin area San Andres, Victorio Peak, and Bone Spring formations are interconnected and contain characteristic karst that facilitate \ufb02ow [10, 11, 23, 24, 41]. Along the state border in the southwestern Otero Mesa/northwestern Diablo Plateau, the Cornudas Mountains are exposed igneous intrusions with additional intrusions in the surrounding subsurface [50\u201352]. These instrusive laccoliths, sills, and dikes were created when Precambrian rocks were metamorphosed into phonolite and syenite and pushed through the subsurface [14, 31, 52, 53]. A secondary aquifer unit exists in the southwestern Salt Basin: the Finlay formation. This aquifer unit is a Cretaceous sea shelf limestone that was frac- tured with carbonate dissolution contributing to additional permeability [31, 54]. Kreitler (1986) [54] is the primary source for information about this Cretaceous unit and surrounding geology. The Finlay limestone has secondary permeabil- 7 Figure 1.3: From [23], reproduced in [31, 49]; generalized geologic diagrammatic west-east cross section of the Salt Basin and Guadalupe Mountains showing shelf- margin and basin facies partially overlaid by alluvium ity and large hydraulic conductivities due to carbonate dissolution and minor faulting. The Finlay limestone formation is juxtaposed with a coarsely fractured Precambrian rhyolite porphyry. Wasserburg et al. (1962) [55] found a rhyolite porphyry exposed at Pump Station Hills in Hudspeth County, TX that was dated to be 1 billion years old using rubidium-strontium dating. Since this age coincides with the Precambrian rhyolite porphyry from Kreitler (1986) [54], the unnamed rhyolite porphyry from Kreitler (1986) [54] will hence be referred to as the \u2018Pump Station Hills rhyolite porphry\u2019. The Pump Station Hills rhyolite porphyry is het- erogeneously fractured, with fractures striking in multiple directions and dips ranging from vertical to horizontal. These variable fractures are not sealed with any mineral precipitation. Kreitler (1986) [54] refers to the shallow aquifer in the Finlay limestone as HU1B and the deeper aquifer in the Pump Station Hills rhyolite as HU1A. The fractures in both aquifers are highly heterogeneous, are likely interconnected, and contribute to a variable \ufb02ow system that is not fully fracture-controlled. Along the eastern margin of the Salt Basin and within the Delaware Moun- tains, the Capitan Reef complex is the dominant carbonate shelf-margin facies. 8 This geological complex includes the western edge of the Capitan limestone, parts of the Goat Seep dolomite, and a few interbedded sandstones (Figure 1.2 and Figure 1.3; [31]. Both the Capitan limestone and Goat Seep dolomite are highly permeable with high groundwater transmissivities [31, 56]. The majority of gyp- sum and evaporite beds in the Capitan Reef complex have been removed over time due to erosion down the Guadalupe Mountain slope [56]. The Permian shelf facies, which are time-equivalent to the Capitan Reef com- plex, make up the Artesia Group in the Guadalupe Mountains (Figure 1.4; [31, 48, 57]. This group is comprised of \ufb01ve formations, each are dolomites interbed- ded with sandstones [46]. The oldest formation within the Artesia Group is the Grayburg."

Figure 1.4: Reproduced in [31]; generalized geologic diagrammatic through Per- mian Basin and Guadalupe Mountains showing stratigraphic nomenclature of Permian strata in the Guadalupe Mountains Denoted by the name of the basin, there are Quaternary to recent evaporites within the Salt Basin, concentrated in the Salt Flat playas in the southeastern portion of the basin. There are gypsum, halite, calcite, dolomite, and quartz sediments in the Salt Flat playas [25, 31, 58, 59]. These salt playas were the motivation behind the El Paso Salt War in the 1860s [60]. The Salt Flats have high evaporative potential and are effectively the discharge area for the Salt Basin groundwaters [13, 25]. Other secondary aquifer units are unconsolidated Neogene alluvial and bol- 9 son deposits (Figure 1.3; [23, 31, 49]). These bolson deposits are sediments eroded from exposed carbonates and moved along ancestral drainages [31, 37]. Alluvial and bolson deposits are combined with lacustrine \ufb01ne-grained clays to form the basin \ufb01ll that has accumulated in the central Salt Basin to a maximum thickness of 2,400 feet [31, 35]. Thinning of the basin \ufb01ll near the basin margins is especially evident on the southern side of the Baylor Mountains due to the Victorio Flex- ure [31, 35]. Ephemeral channels of the Salt Basin are comprised of these alluvial deposits [61]. The Salt Basin is part of the overall Permian Basin that was formed during the Mississippian/Pennsylvanian collision of the North and South American plates [62]. Those original deposits have been subsequently deformed into the modern Salt Basin. Intensely faulted terrain was caused by three time periods of major tectonic activity: mid-to-late Permian, the Late Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene Laramide orogeny, and Neogene Basin-and-Range tectonism [31]. During the mid to late Permian, the Otero fault, Babb and Victorio Flexure, and Bitterwell Break were created (Figure 1.5; [12, 63, 64]). The Otero fault cuts through the Otero Mesa/ Diablo Plateau and continues towards the southeast, striking northwest and displacing down to the northeast. The monocline \ufb02exures cut through the basement blocks of the Salt Basin graben and trend northwest to southeast with a northeastward dip [64]. The Victorio Flexure has a more easterly trend as com- pared to the Babb Flexure [63]. The Bitterwell Break is a fault through the Salt Basin graben basement rocks trending northeastward from the Babb Flexure to- wards the Delaware Mountains. The Victorio Flexure and Babb Flexure deformed the Cretaceous Finlay formation and Precambrian Pump Station Hills rhyolite porphyry [54]. The Late Cretaceous Laramide orogeny produced folds, primarily in the New Mexico portion of the Salt Basin (Figure 1.6; [12]). A later structure, named the Otero Break, was added to the Salt Basin during the Neogene when west-oriented extension tilted previously northeast trending synclines, anticlines, and graben fault blocks into west dipping normal faults (Figure 1.7; [12, 40, 64]). This break extends to the southeast from the southern Sacramento Mountains near Timberon, NM. Additional faulting throughout the Sierra Diablo Mountains coincided with the Otero Break formation in the Neogene [12]. 1.6 Hydrology 1.6.1 Hydrological Sources Once precipitation enters the endorheic Salt Basin, the water either evapo- rates in the semiarid climate or in\ufb01ltrates into the groundwater system. There is minimal surface water present in the Salt Basin [11, 14, 41, 65]. The majority of recharge into the Salt Basin originates as winter precipitation in high eleva- tions of the Sacramento Mountains and in\ufb01ltrates through fractures and perme- able, coarse-grained alluvium before reaching the basin center near Dell City, TX [9, 11, 13, 14, 16, 17, 22, 24, 41, 65, 66]. The groundwater is internally drained 10 toward the center of the basin near Dell City, Texas (Figure 1.8). To clarify: water in the southwestern Salt Basin \ufb02ows towards the northeast [10, 13, 23, 24, 35] and water in the northwestern Salt Basin \ufb02ows towards the southeast along Otero Break fractures [11, 14, 23, 36, 40, 47, 64, 65, 67]. This interpretation is corrobo- rated by 34S analyses [16]. The relative isotopic abundance of 34S increases from the Sacramento Mountain ridges to the mountain lowlands near Alamogordo, Tularosa, Pe\u02dcnasco, and Artesia and since the isotopic signature is consistent with Permian marine gypsum, the water appears to \ufb02ow past and dissolve that gypsum before reaching the open plains [16]. Groundwater samples from the Otero Break are consistent with this interpretation, as those waters contain low TDS (approxi- mately 500 mg/L) due to the high groundwater velocity from the recharge area in the Sacramento Mountains [14, 40]. The overall trend for the Salt Basin shows an increase in TDS moving toward the south. This pattern is consistent with the previously described \ufb02ow paths, as there is more enrichment of TDS with both increased water-rock interactions and increased evaporation through the vadose zone during recharge. The Salt Basin shares the Sacramento Mountain highlands with the Pe\u02dcnasco Basin to the northeast and the amount of cross-divide \ufb02ow between the two basins is controversial. Groundwater inter-basin \ufb02ow into the Salt Basin from the Pe\u02dcnasco Basin is explicitly quanti\ufb01ed as 7,954 and 5,541 acre-feet per year by Finch (2002) [9] and Shomaker (2010) [11], respectively. The model domain used by Finch (2002) included adjacent parts of the Pe\u02dcnasco Basin since the groundwater elevation contours along the northern boundary of the Salt Basin showed the two basins being hydraulically connected, speci\ufb01cally between Timberon and Pi\u02dcnon, NM [9].

The Salt Basin shares the Sacramento Mountain highlands with the Pe\u02dcnasco Basin to the northeast and the amount of cross-divide \ufb02ow between the two basins is controversial. Groundwater inter-basin \ufb02ow into the Salt Basin from the Pe\u02dcnasco Basin is explicitly quanti\ufb01ed as 7,954 and 5,541 acre-feet per year by Finch (2002) [9] and Shomaker (2010) [11], respectively.

Shomaker (2010) used Darcy\u2019s Law calculations to estimate the groundwater in\ufb02ow from the Pe\u02dcnasco Basin assuming most of the in\ufb02ow went into the San Andres and Yeso Formations and assuming aquifer parameters for each unit [11]. Though not quanti\ufb01ed, Sigstedt et al. (2016) [17] referred to a minor component of recharge moving southwards into the Pi\u02dcnon Creek sub-basin due to inter-basin subsurface drainage from the Pe\u02dcnasco Basin. As groundwater \ufb02ow across the watershed boundary is not required to balance the hydrologic system, Mayer (1995) [40] suggested that the in\ufb02ow is effectively negligible. Stating there is a lack of data to create a conclusive argument in either case, Hutchison (2008) [10] assumed there was negligible inter-basin groundwater in\ufb02ow from the Pe\u02dcnasco Basin. In short, some previous researchers quanti\ufb01ed groundwater in\ufb02ow, some considered inter-basin groundwater \ufb02ow to be negligible, and many ignored the possibility completely. There is a component of aquifer recharge that is the result of in\ufb01ltration of irrigation water that was itself originally pumped from the aquifer [23]. The irrigation returns by deep seepage (\u201creturn \ufb02ow\u201d) draws down salts that build up in the evaporative layer and transports them into the aquifer [40, 41]. The quantity of irrigation return \ufb02ow depends on the quantity of irrigation water required to sustain the crops and livestock in the given climatic conditions. Mayer (1995) [40] estimated that the return \ufb02ow is between 30 and 50% of the irrigation volume applied to the surface. Since farmers strive to minimize costs associated with extraneous water usage, it is possible that there is less irrigation return \ufb02ow to the 11 aquifer than Mayer (1995) [40] suggests. In most recharge estimation calculations, the return \ufb02ow volumes of water are considered negligible or not included to simplify the recharge investigations to natural recharge. 1.6.2 Major Flow Paths The major water \ufb02ow paths follow the Sacramento River, Pi\u02dcnon Creek, and Shiloh Draw, while some of the minor \ufb02ow paths follow Cornucopia Draw, Big Dog Canyon, Antelope Draw, South Well Draw, Capitan \ufb02ow path, and the Salt Flats (Figure 1.9). These sub-watersheds are from the United States Geological Survey\u2019s (USGS) National Watershed Boundary Dataset (WBD) [68]. As further clari\ufb01cation, the sub-watersheds are classi\ufb01ed under the USGS Hydrological Unit Code (HUC) as 10-digit watersheds within the Salt Basin subbasin within the Rio Grande Closed Basins basin and subregion within the overall Rio Grande region [69]. The Sacramento River has its headwaters in the high elevations of the Sacramento Mountains, but it is only perennial for a short distance before in\ufb01ltrating back into the groundwater system. The water from the Sacramento River dominantly recharges the San Andres, Yeso, Bone Spring, and Victorio Peak fractured limestone aquifers through channel in\ufb01ltration and subsequent underground lateral \ufb02ow [13, 17, 35, 70]. Pi\u02dcnon Creek has its headwaters in the southeastern Sacramento Mountains where the Pe\u02dcnasco Basin contributes groundwater in\ufb02ow before the creek follows the Salt Basin margin to the east and then southward to meet the Salt Flats. Like the Sacramento River, Pi\u02dcnon Creek recharges the limestone aquifers near the eastern margin of the Salt Basin. Shiloh Draw is a catchment on the Otero Mesa/Diablo Plateau that is dry outside of the monsoon season, during which there are ephemeral \ufb02ows. This western catchment contributes to the limestone aquifers that predominate in the Salt Basin. Antelope Draw and South Well Draw are ephemeral channels that \ufb02ow from the southwestern margin of the Salt Basin into the Salt Flats south of Dell City, TX. These draws \ufb02ow through Cretaceous fractured limestone and rhyolites [54]. 1.6.3 Hydrology-Literature Review The water-budget of the Salt Basin includes: precipitation, groundwater in\ufb02ow, pumping, evapotranspiration (ET), and groundwater recharge into the carbonate aquifer. Outgoing water excludes groundwater or surface water out\ufb02ow because the Salt Basin is a hydrologically closed basin. All of the water in a closed basin is internally drained and the basin is effectively an isolated hydrological system (Fan, 1997). Most the components of the water-budget can be estimated in- dependently with historic data, with the expectation of the groundwater recharge and the associated groundwater storage. As a result, the recharge is the primary estimate that is frequently modi\ufb01ed in association with distinct research methods. 12 There have been twelve groundwater recharge estimates for the Salt Basin made since 1957 that estimate from 6,000 to 240,000 acre-feet per year. Coinciding with the 1950\u2019s development of water resources within the Salt Basin, Bjorklund (1957) [41] was one of the \ufb01rst to make an estimate of recharge for the basin, speculating that it was less than 100,000 acre-feet per year. This loose estimate was made with inspection of well water \ufb02uctuation in response to irrigation pumping. When the pumping rate removed more than 100,000 acre- feet per year from the aquifer, there was noticeable downdraw in the irrigation wells. Bjorklund (1957) [41] proposed that a pumping rate less than or equal to the recharge rate would result in negligible drawdown. There were no supporting calculations; the estimate was based on observation of water levels [41]. Irrigation return \ufb02ows and evaporation would complicate the groundwater \ufb02ow system and likely decrease the recharge rate for the basin. Being the earliest recharge estimate for the Salt Basin, this simple recharge estimate from Bjorklund (1957) [41] does not account for the complexity of the groundwater system, modern precipitation rates, nor modern recharge rates. Similar to Bjorklund\u2019s well water level \ufb02uctuation method, Ashworth (1995) [23] estimated that the recharge of the groundwater"

Similar to Bjorklund\u2019s well water level \ufb02uctuation method, Ashworth (1995) [23] estimated that the recharge of the groundwater system of the Salt Basin would be 90,000 to 100,000 acre-feet per year. Ashworth (1995) [23] observed that pumping rates between 40,000 and 60,000 acre-feet per year resulted in a well water level rise, while pumping rates between 90,000 and 100,000 acre-feet per year resulted in no change to the water level. For a water balance, the discharge from the groundwater system in the form of irrigation consumptive use should be roughly equal to the recharge. It was assumed that this recharge estimate inherently contains potential recharge from lateral in\ufb02ow from the Pe\u02dcnasco Basin to the northeast and irrigation return \ufb02ow [23]. There were no supporting calculations for the groundwater recharge estimate nor exploration of recharge rates greater than 100,000 acre-feet per year made by Ashworth (1995) [23], so there is limited reliability in the estimate. Mayer (1995) [40] estimated a recharge of 88,000 to 100,000 acre-feet per year. The source of recharge is split between irrigation return \ufb02ow and distributed recharge from across the surface area of the Salt Basin, contributing 30,000-42,000 and 58,000 acre-feet per year, respectively. Multiple sources cite Mayer\u2019s 1995 recharge estimate as the distributed recharge value rather than the combined quantity [11, 25, 65]. The irrigation return \ufb02ow has a range of values as it depended upon chosen soil permeability and climatic conditions. Distributed recharge is further broken into two components: high elevation recharge (57,400 acre- feet/year) and low elevation recharge (600 acre-feet/year). Mayer (1995) [40] used the Maxey-Eakin method to estimate high elevation recharge above 1,600 m. Maxey-Eakin recharge method was \ufb01rst established and applied to valleys within the Great Basin, Nevada in 1949. This method determines recharge coef\ufb01cients based on the \u2018precipitation zone\u2019, or the average annual precipitation amount for each area. That coef\ufb01cient is then applied to volumes of precipitation within a given area of a closed arid basin to ultimately estimate groundwater recharge [71, 72]. The Maxey-Eakin equation is given by 13 R = N \u2211 i=1 \u03b2i \u00afPiAi (1.2) This equation calculates the recharge as the sum of a recharge coef\ufb01cient (\u03b2), the average long-term precipitation within the area as the \u2018precipitation zone\u2019 (P), and the aerial area of the speci\ufb01ed area. The \u2018N\u2019 parameter in the equation denotes the number of precipitation zones within the overall study area [72]. In order to apply this method to the Salt Basin, Mayer (1995) [40] assumed there were similar climate conditions, geology, and lithology between the high elevations in the Salt Basin and the Great Basin, NV. While the higher elevations on average have more precipitation than evaporation, lower elevations are usually dominated by evapo- ration. The lower elevations recharge estimates are based on soil-chloride pro\ufb01les from the Diablo Plateau [40]. By distinguishing the differences in precipitation and recharge relationships based on elevation, Mayer (1995) [40] produced a recharge estimate with a lower source of error than those estimates that upscaled across the entire basin regardless of elevation. Nonetheless, the recharge quantity that Mayer (1995) [40] estimated has limited reliability as the assumption that Nevada and the Salt Basin have similar climates is inaccurate; Nevada receives most of its precipitation in the winter and the Salt Basin receives most of its precipitation in the summer monsoon season [39]. This discrepancy most likely means that more of the Salt Basin precipitation is evaporated in the hot summer climate and less is truly being recharged, although the higher intensity of monsoon precipitation may lead to greater runoff volumes and therefore greater focused recharge. Finch (2002) [9] estimated a recharge of 54,943 acre-feet per year for the entire Salt Basin. The majority of this recharge (35,000 acre-feet per year) originates in the New Mexico portion of the Salt Basin. This value was estimated using a surplus precipitation method. Assuming surplus of precipitation occurs during the winter months when evaporative potential is minimal, almost all of the winter- storm precipitation will runoff into the basin center with negligible in\ufb01ltration or evaporation [9]. To corroborate the estimate for the northern portion of the Salt Basin, the highly fractured rock along the Otereo Break is assumed to be a preferential recharge \ufb02ow path that supports most of the 35,000 acre-feet per year of recharge. The total recharge estimate for the Salt Basin was determined using a three-dimensional steady state groundwater \ufb02ow model water balance [9], and thus the recharge estimate depends strongly on the hydraulic conductivity distribution assumed for the model. In 2004, Last Chance Water Company, in collaboration with Sandia National Laboratories, provided a recharge estimate for Salt Basin to be between 30,000 and 240,000 acre-feet per year [24]. This estimate is based on previous work done by Gates (1980) [35] and Ashworth (1995) [23] and carries the same potential errors. Chace and Roberts (2004) [24] cite the overall range of recharge, but emphasizes the possibility that recharge is towards the higher end of the range between 100,000 and 240,000 acre-feet per year. This inclination is the result of observations of monsoonal \ufb02ow in sub-basins not included in previous estimates: 14 Cornucopia Draw, Shiloh Draw, and Fourmile Draw [24]. Although the draws appear to carry a large volume of water during high intensity precipitation events, subsequent researchers suggest that their contribution to recharge is negligible compared to the quantity of recharge from precipitation in the high-elevations of the Sacramento Mountains [14, 16]. There is no original data provided to support the claims of Chace and Roberts (2004)"

There is no original data provided to support the claims of Chace and Roberts (2004) [24] and thus, their recharge estimate has limited value. Hutchison (2008) [10] used the Maxey-Eakin method and transient ground- water budget model calibrations to estimate recharge for the Salt Basin of 71,531 acre-feet per year. Mayer (1995) [40] used the same method for part of their analy- sis. The models used by Hutchison (2008) [10] focused on distinct components of the groundwater-budget: structural geology, isotopic geochemistry, and a hybrid of the two. The structural geology model is based on work from Mayer (1995) [40] that postulates a preferential \ufb02ow path along Otero Break from the Sacramento Mountains to Dell City, Texas [10]. Eastoe and Hibbs (2005) [73] was the basis of the isotopic geochemistry model suggesting that a signi\ufb01cant portion of recharge in Dell City, Texas originated in the Diablo Plateau, west of the city [10]. The hybrid model combines the two likely sources of water for Dell City, Texas to estimate a groundwater-budget for the entire Salt Basin. This recharge estimate contains error associated with the Nevada-calibrated Maxey-Eakin method and intrinsic uncertainty of model calibration. Calibrating and revising a groundwater \ufb02ow model, Shomaker (2010) [11] estimated groundwater recharge in the Salt Basin to be 61,723 acre-feet per year. An initial recharge estimate of 58,482 acre-feet per year was based on a concep- tual recharge model that combined groundwater in\ufb02ow from the Pe\u02dcnasco Basin, areal recharge (also called diffuse recharge) from the highlands of the Sacramento Mountains, and stormwater runoff in\ufb01ltration along the \ufb02ow paths of ephemeral arroyos [11]. However, this initial estimate did not account for potential ground- water discharge and required modi\ufb01cations. Shomaker (2010) [11] calibrated a more inclusive groundwater \ufb02ow model for the entire Salt Basin using historic data and transient conditions. The second attempt to estimate recharge resulted in a range of recharge rates between 35,000 and 90,000 acre-feet per year [11]). The ultimate recharge estimate from Shomaker (2010) [11] was from a calibrated steady state groundwater \ufb02ow model that assumed 1.5 percernt of precipitation becomes recharge. This estimate included 5,451 acre-feet per year groundwater in\ufb02ow from the Pe\u02dcnasco Basin, 40,888 acre-feet per year areal recharge, and 15,384 acre-feet per year of stormwater runoff in\ufb01ltration. While this recharge estimate separates different types of recharge, which helps constrain sources of error and facilitates comparisons with other estimates using different methods, it is limited by the chosen model parameters and calibrations. Daniel B. Stephens and Associates [25, 65] conducted two studies to esti- mate groundwater recharge in the Salt Basin that independently estimated 37,000 to 82,000 acre-feet per year and 26,710 acre-feet per year, respectively. DBS&A (2010a) [65] used a distributed-parameter water-balance model that was devel- oped by Sandia National Laboratory for use at Yucca Mountain, Nevada. This 15 model accounts for precipitation, evapotranspiration, overland \ufb02ow, and soil wa- ter storage [65]. The range of recharge quantities are the result of multiple tests for below-average, average, and above-average precipitation years based on the precipitation data collected in Dell City, Texas and Cloudcroft, New Mexico [65]. Mayer (1995) [40] and Hutchison (2008) [10] also used Nevada as a surrogate site, as assumption implicit in their use of the Maxey-Eakin method, which was \ufb01rst developed using data from Nevada, and which potentially overestimates recharge due to winter precipitation in Nevada. In contrast, use of the Yuca Mountain model introduces the assumption that the hydrological processes in the Salt Basin are similar to those in Nevada, which is a less stringent assumption than for the use of Maxey-Eakin. The second recharge estimate from DBS&A (2010b) [25] assumed that recharge into the basin was equal to the discharge of water via evaporation on the playas of the Salt Flats prior to anthropogenic alteration of the \ufb02ow system. This method used geological rates of salt accumulation on the playa surface, which was controlled by the evaporation rate to infer groundwater recharge rates [25]. Salt accumulation rates were determined by dating cores of the evaporative sediment collected from the playa and by assuming a concentration of gypsum-forming minerals in the Salt Basin groundwater [25]. The concentra- tion of gypsum-forming minerals, i.e. calcium and sulfate, was assumed to be 500 mg/L based on groundwater concentrations upgradient before evaporation occurred [25]. To make the conversion between evaporite depositional rates to groundwater recharge rates, DBS&A (2010b) [25] assumed that there was no runoff from the playa surface, loss of water through a different outlet that did not deposit evaporates, nor loss of evaporites from the playa. However, this assumption is invalid because the salt playas of the Salt Basin were the basis of the 1860\u2019s El Paso Salt War, in which salt was removed from the playas [60]. Some evaporites were removed from the playas during the historic timeline of the study and thus the evaporite depositional rates would re\ufb02ect a slower deposition. Hence, the recharge estimate from DBS&A (2010b) [25] is likely an underestimate for the recharge rate of the Salt Basin. Combining the two recharge estimates and con- ceding the potential inaccuracy of each method, the recharge estimate of DBS&A (2010a) [65] and DBS&A (2010b) [25] is between 26,710 and 82,000 acre-feet per year. Tillery (2011) [61] used a mean-annual stream\ufb02ow method to estimate a \ufb02ow of 60,414 acre-feet per year that has the potential to recharge the carbonate aquifers from within four of the major Salt Basin sub-basins.

Combining the two recharge estimates and con- ceding the potential inaccuracy of each method, the recharge estimate of DBS&A (2010a) [65] and DBS&A (2010b) [25] is between 26,710 and 82,000 acre-feet per year. Tillery (2011) [61] used a mean-annual stream\ufb02ow method to estimate a \ufb02ow of 60,414 acre-feet per year that has the potential to recharge the carbonate aquifers from within four of the major Salt Basin sub-basins. The mean-annual stream\ufb02ow for the Pi\u02dcnon Creek, Sacramento River, Big Dog Canyon, and Cor- nucopia Draw sub-basins were estimated using an active channel geometry and a basin area analysis method. The channel geometry-based estimation used the average width of channels as calibration points to estimate the average amount of \ufb02ow as a function of channel geometry. The relationship between active-channel width and mean annual discharge was estimated from a regression of gauged mountain-front streams from throughout southern New Mexico, most of which were perennial. Due to the semiarid environment, virtually all of the surface water in the Salt Basin is ephemeral. This difference in water systems means that the active-channel width method likely leads to an over-estimate of the actual 16 mean-annual stream\ufb02ow. Further, the active-channel geometry method was cali- brated using channel with widths ranging from 15 to 55 feet. Some of the channels in the Salt Basin were outside of this range [61]. Tillery (2011) [61] also used a basin-surface-area regression analysis and found estimates similar to that of the active channel geometry method. This analysis utilized a regression of sub-basin surface area and average precipitation rate for the elevation against mean annual discharge, trained using the same southern New Mexico mountain-front streams. Since the sub-basins analyzed were outside the effective range of the method, there was a loss of sensitivity, and a potential underestimate of mean-annual stream\ufb02ow [61]. The standard error of the basin regression was 46% compared to 29% for the active-channel width regression, leading Tillery (2011) [61] to prefer the active-channel method. Sigstedt et al. (2016) [17] estimated a total recharge of 6,000 to 12,000 acre-feet per year. Due to the correlation between the groundwater age and increase in TDS concentrations along the groundwater \ufb02ow path, geochemical modeling of the radiometric age of distinct \ufb02ow path in the Salt Basin can be used to calibrate all of the \ufb02ow paths throughout the northern basin [17]. The groundwater age from the 14C speci\ufb01c activity can be further utilized to determine the groundwater \ufb02ow rate. The \ufb02ow rate for a distinct groundwater \ufb02ow path is upscaled to the entire Salt Basin drainage area to produce a recharge estimate. Upscaling across the basin naturally introduces additional error to the recharge estimates, but utilizing the isotopic concentrations along the groundwater \ufb02ow path helps account for the spatial variation in recharge. 1.6.4 Previous Hydrochemistry Analyses Groundwater chemistry parameters reported by previous geochemistry studies of the Salt Basin and surrounding areas are typical for a carbonate aquifer system. The pH of the groundwater in the area is slightly alkaline and is naturally buffered due to the high concentrations of the bicarbonate anion [41, 74]. The local geology controls the water chemistry in the Salt Basin groundwater system, as dissolution of minerals such as halite, gypsum, and dolomite donate common major ions in the Salt Basin water system, including magnesium, potassium, and calcium [11, 13, 14, 23, 25, 41, 74]. The longer the water interacts with the surfaces of the minerals composing the aquifer, the greater the concentrations that result from dissolution of the minerals until the solution reaches equilibrium with the present minerals. Consequently, many of the major cations within the water system increase in concentration moving down the \ufb02ow system, such as magnesium, potassium, and calcium [14]. As the groundwater moves towards the central Salt Basin, the cations move toward an equimolar calcium-to-magnesium ratio [17]. Speci\ufb01cally, the observed chemical changes are consistent with dedolomiti- zation and gypsum dissolution as described in Back et al. (1983), Miller (1997), 17 Shomaker (2010), Sigstedt (2010) and Sigstedt et al., (2016) [11, 14, 17, 74, 75]. Mete- oric water passing through a carbonate aquifer tends to dissolve calcite, dolomite, and gypsum. The rate of mineral dissolution depends on the geochemical disso- lution kinetics of each mineral [17, 75]. Initially, gypsum, calcite, and dolomite dissolve congruently. Gypsum dissolves at a faster rate than calcite and dolomite, with the latter having the slowest dissolution rate. The dissolution of gypsum releases calcium ions into the water, which forces the incongruent precipitation of calcium carbonate in the form of calcite, which occurs at a faster rate than dolomite can precipitate. The rapid precipitation of calcite consumes carbonate, leading to undersaturation with respect to dolomite. This undersaturation with respect to dolomite was seen by Mayer (1995), Shomaker (2010), Sigstedt (2010), and Sigstedt et al. (2016) [11, 14, 17, 40] in groundwater samples from the high elevations of the Sacramento Mountains and into the Otero Break. That undersaturation of dolomite causes dolomite to dissolve, releasing magnesium and precipitating calcite; a process that is known as \u201cdedolomitization\u201d. Dedolomitization can be described with the following three chemical reactions and net reaction [75]: Gypsum dissolution and preciptiation: CaSO4(gypsum) \u2194Ca2+(aq) + SO2\u2212 4 (aq) + 2HCO\u2212 3 (aq) (1.3) Dolomite dissolution: CaMg(CO3)2(dolomite) + 2H+(aq) \u2192Ca2+(aq) + Mg2+(aq) + 2HCO\u2212 3 (aq) (1.4) Calcite preciptiation: Ca2+(aq) + 2HCO\u2212 3 (aq) \u2192CaCO3(calcite) + H+(aq) (1.5) Net dedolomitization reaction: gypsum + dolomite \u21922calcite + Mg2+ + SO2\u2212 4 + 2H2O (1.6) There is high potential for dedolomitization where there is a high magnesium-to-calcium ratio, as observed in the Salt Basin by Chapman (1984) [13]. The overall geochemical evolution of the groundwater results in an increase in sulfate from the gypsum and magnesium from the dolomite and a decrease in carbonate resulting from the incongruent precipitation of the calcite [17, 75]. This process also contributes to the alkaline pH of the carbonate waters (Miller, 1997). Sigstedt (2010) and Sigstedt et al. (2016) [14, 17,"

This process also contributes to the alkaline pH of the carbonate waters (Miller, 1997). Sigstedt (2010) and Sigstedt et al. (2016) [14, 17, 74] observed a trend of dedolomitization in the groundwater samples moving from the northern Salt Basin towards the south (Figure 1.10; [12, 63, 64]). This \ufb01gure only contains the well chemistry data from Sigstedt (2010) and Sigstedt et al. (2016) [14, 17] and is not fully representative of all geochemistry data for the Salt Basin. Kreitler et al. (1986) [54] conducted a geological and hydrological study of the southwestern Salt Basin to determine a suitable potential location for an above- ground, low-level radioactive waste disposal facility. As previously mentioned, 18 the southwestern Salt Basin is the location of the Cretaceous Finlay limestone and Precambrian Pump Station Hills rhyolite porphyry. These geological units produced a unique chemistry. Kreitler et al. (1986) [54] found no trend in TDS dis- tributions throughout the southwestern Salt Basin. Correspondingly, the chemical compositions of the groundwaters in this area were seemingly erratic and failed to show any chemical evolution moving down gradient. Further, there was no trend in tritium that could be used to identify recently recharged waters. Instead, there was tritium present in almost all groundwater samples, suggesting rapid recharge in the southwestern Salt Basin. The explanation for this anomalous chemistry from Kreitler et al. (1986) [54] referred to the coarsely and heterogeneously fractured geological facies. The fractures would produce an anisotropic fracture-controlled \ufb02ow system that could contribute variable chemical constituents and support rapid recharge. Due to the evaporative nature of the semiarid Salt Basin environment, the shallow aquifers and near-surface soils exhibit increased TDS concentrations as compared to the deeper alluvial-basin \ufb01ll aquifers [13, 14, 40, 59, 74]. Water is pulled up from the saturated aquifer into the unsaturated vadose zone as a capillary fringe. Since there is a thick capillary fringe that is able to reach the surface in the area of the Salt Flats, there is a signi\ufb01cant amount of water being delivered to the surface by capillarity and then evaporated [13]. This evaporation is effectively constant, with water continuously being pulled up through the vadose zone and evaporated away [13]. As the water moves through the subsurface, it transports solutes. Evaporation of the water near the surface causes an enrichment of ions and often mineral precipitation. Within the central basin, there is also an increase in chloride and sodium. The process adding the chloride and sodium to the groundwater is likely the back-mixing of evaporative brines, combining modern groundwater with brines that previously existed in the basin center that were enriched in chloride and sodium as a result of local halite dissolution [17]. 19 Figure 1.5: From [12]; Permian structural features; arrows indicate sense of dis- placement; bar on downthrown side of Bitterwell Break 20 Figure 1.6: From [12]; Laramide structural features; bar on downthrown side of McGregor fault 21 Figure 1.7: From [12]; Cenozoic structural features; bar on downthrown side of normal or high angle faults 22 Figure 1.8: Observed potentiometric map of the salt Basin; lines are at 50m intervals 23 Figure 1.9: Salt Basin observed potentiometric surface map and HUC 10 sub- watersheds [68]; potentiometric intervals are 50m 24 Figure 1.10: From [14, 17]; Reproduced in [31]; Piper diagram of Salt Basin chem- istry from [14, 17] and spatial distribution of points along Pi\u02dcnon Creek; Piper diagram shows linear trend indicative of dedolomitization; star is an outlier point 25 CHAPTER 2 GROUNDWATER CHEMISTRY METHODS 2.1 Well Database The scope of this project extends beyond a single \ufb01eld campaign. Conse- quently, historic hydrochemical data supplemented the data collected in conjunc- tion with this study. Historic data came from multiple sources over more than 80 years. There are more than 800 groundwater samples from nearly 400 water wells throughout the Salt Basin that have been sampled and analyzed throughout the basin\u2019s history. These data are compiled in an open database through the New Mexico Bureau of Geology and Mineral Resources (NMBGMR; Aquifer Mapping Program) (Appendix A.1). The full data set was comprised of groundwater, spring, precipitation, and perennial stream water samples with major and minor elemental chemistry and environmental tracer analyses. The data included calcium, chlo- ride, carbonate, bicarbonate, bromide, potassium, magnesium, sodium, sulfate, total dissolved solids, temperature, pH, \u03b413C, carbon-14, tritium, and oxygen-18. Figure 2.1 shows the spatial extent of the data within and around the Salt Basin. 2.2 Differentiation of Flow Paths/Geological Provinces To better visualize the groundwater movement of the Salt Basin, the full hy- drochemical dataset was separated by likely groundwater \ufb02ow paths. These \ufb02ow paths were based on surface water sub-watersheds and the observed groundwater potentiometric surface. Previous studies have delineated some New Mexican \ufb02ow path watersheds (Sacramento River, Pi\u02dcnon Creek, Cornucopia Draw, and Big Dog Canyon) within the Salt Basin, as shown in Figure 2.2; [61]. The Sacramento River, Pi\u02dcnon Creek, and Cornucopia Draw \ufb02ow paths were extended towards Dell City following the observed potentiometric surface. For the Texas portion of the Salt Basin, the \ufb02ow paths were based on sub-watersheds and the observed potentio- metric surface. For some chemical analyses, it was more convenient to separate the Salt Basin based on the dominant geology. The Salt Basin map (Figure 1.1) and surface geology map (Figure 1.2) were used to separate the geological provinces. The designation of \ufb02ow paths and geological provinces allowed the massive data set to be condensed for more practical analyses. An additional bene\ufb01t of the \ufb02ow path separation is that it made it possible to make analogies between \ufb02ow paths"

An additional bene\ufb01t of the \ufb02ow path separation is that it made it possible to make analogies between \ufb02ow paths 26 Figure 2.1: Salt Basin HUC 10 sub-watersheds, observed potentiometric surface map, and chemistry data points from Appendix A.1 with ample data to those with limited data. The geological provinces facilitated the comparison between chemical patterns and geological patterns. 2.3 Hydrochemical Evolution Rarely are waters indistinguishable across landscapes. Commonly, waters gain constituents with distance from recharge areas due to mineral dissolution and con\ufb02uence with other waters. This basic increase in constituent concentration along a \ufb02ow path can be seen by plotting the given constituent or a ratio of two constituents on a map-view of the Salt Basin. From this aerial display, patterns of chemical evolution can be determined at a basin-wide scale. The level of chemical evolution between individual water sample points along a singular \ufb02ow path can determine the effective processes of that \ufb02ow path. In order to isolate that chemical evolution, a pair-wise matrix was created to plot every major constituent against one another. Trends between components suggest chemical connectivity and reactions. Chemical evolution was also evident in Piper diagrams. These diagrams are a graphical representation of major cations and anions within water 27 Figure 2.2: Salt Basin study area showing location of surface-water subbasins measured by Tillery (2011) [61] samples. Each section of the diagram corresponds to a hydrochemical facies. Moving from facies to facies or staying within one facies has hydrochemical connotations. It is important to understand the connection between the hydrochemistry and the underground geology that often sources additional constituents to the water. As limestones are the most common aquifer within the Salt Basin, it limits the chemical reactions that are probable. The majority of the groundwater will be neutral to slightly alkaline and likely have high total dissolved solids (TDS). Within this range of pH values, the majority of carbonate is in the form of bicarbonate. 2.3.1 Expected Hydrochemical Trends Continuing an analysis of geological impacts on hydrochemical data, pre- vious studies in the Salt Basin have found dedolomitization to be a dominant chemical evolution throughout the carbonate facies of the basin [11, 14, 17, 74]. 28 This process is characterized by a dissolution of gypsum, calcite, and dolomite [75]. Referring to Figure 1.10, this chemical evolution appears in the Piper diagrams. Dedolomitization has a characteristic increase in sulfate and magnesium, a slight increase in calcium concentrations (moving towards a one-to-one ratio of calcium-to-magnesium), and a decrease in carbonate [17, 75]. These changes will be evident in the constituents\u2019 plot along the \ufb02ow path. The one-to-one ratio of Ca/Mg will be evident in the ratio distribution map of Ca/Mg. In the southwestern portion of the Salt Basin, Kreitler (1986) [54] noted a wide variability of chemical concentrations throughout Antelope Draw and South Well Draw. This range and lack of trends was contributed to highly fractured aquifers. It is expected that the lack of trend that Kreitler (1986) [54] found in the southwestern Salt Basin will be evident in the constituents\u2019 plot along the \ufb02ow paths. Brines mixing in from the Salt Flats/playas should contribute additional sodium and chloride to the groundwaters because the evaporites in the playas are primarily halite [25, 31, 58, 59]. This increase in sodium and chloride will be evident in the constituents\u2019 plot along the \ufb02ow paths or with proximity to the playas. This change from a system dominated in sulfate to a system dominated in chloride will also be evident in the ratio distribution map of sulfate-to-chloride. 2.3.2 Hydrogen and Oxygen Evolution Precipitation undergoes chemical evolution through different pathways as it becomes groundwater. Water is comprised on hydrogen and oxygen, but those elements have a range of isotopes. Hydrogen is usually found in the forms of hydrogen-1, usually shortened to hydrogen (H), or deuterium (D or 2H). Oxygen is usually found in the forms of oxygen-16 (16O) or oxygen-18 (18O). The local meteoric water line (LMWL) is representative of the natural ranges of deuterium and oxygen-18 of local precipitation from summer to winter precipitation. Summer precipitation has waters characteristically enriched in deuterium and oxygen-18. Water containing hydrogen and oxygen-16 are preferentially evaporated with respect to waters with the heavier isotopes, deuterium and oxygen-18. However, warmer temperatures of summer cause more evaporation. Thus, waters with both the light and heavy isotopes of hydrogen and oxygen are added to the atmosphere to be rained out. In contrast, winter precipitation is characteristically depleted in deuterium and oxygen-18. Cooler temperatures produce less evaporation. With less evaporation, only the water with light isotopes, hydrogen and oxygen-16, are evaporated into the atmosphere to be rained out. This seasonal variability can be seen by plotting deuterium against oxygen-18 of the precipitation. Previous studies of the Salt Basin precipitation and groundwater show winter precipitation in the Sacramento Mountains being the source of the majority of recharge in the Salt Basin [9, 11, 13, 14, 16, 17, 24, 41, 65, 66]. Jasechko (2019) [76] discusses some of the major evolution pathways that affect deuterium and oxygen-18. Some of these pathways include evaporation, 29 mixing with fossil waters, or distal transport. In order to distinguish the different pathways of hydrological evolution, the delta concentrations of deuterium and oxygen in precipitation and groundwater are plotted and compared against the local meteoric water line. If there was no fractionation between precipitation and groundwater, the two data sets would be along the LMWL. Fractionation caused by evaporation will result in groundwaters with increased 2H and further increased 18O. Hence, the groundwater will"

Fractionation caused by evaporation will result in groundwaters with increased 2H and further increased 18O. Hence, the groundwater will be below the LMWL. Mixing with fossil waters that were precipitated under different climatic conditions will cause an increase of deuterium and an increase in oxygen-18 along the LMWL, but will be between the fossil water end member and the fresh precipitation end member. The LMWL trend is also shown with distal transport and the resulting water is between a distal end member and the fresh precipitation end member. The difference between the precipitation and groundwater delta values increasing as the process becomes more dominant. 2.4 Han Plots\u2013 Carbon Analysis Dissolved inorganic carbon concentrations, carbon-13, and carbon-14 can be utilized as a tracer to determine dominant chemical evolution pathways. Han et al. (2012) [2] was used as the basis for carbon analysis. Hydrochemical data is plotted in three graphs, such as in Figure 2.3: i) 1/DIC versus \u03b413C, ii) 1/DIC versus 14C, and iii) \u03b413C versus 14C. Dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) in the form of bicarbonate was included in this analysis to differentiate source of carbon. The method described in Appendix A of Han et al. (2012) [2] was used to place the reference lines on these three plots to separate the carbon data into regions. The lines added to graph i and graph iii are dependent upon the measured soil carbon dioxide gas trapped in the groundwater when the system became closed [2]. The X and Z line represent process lines. The X line has constant 1/DIC in graph i and graph ii and constant \u03b413C in graph iii, indicating radioactive decay of carbon-14 without exchanging inorganic carbon with another source, such as carbonates. The Z line follows geochemical evolutionary changes in radiocarbon, \u03b413C, and 1/DIC with no radiocarbon decay and assuming exchange with carbon- 14 dead, solid carbonate minerals through time. The vertical line for 1/DIC and the diagonal \u201cZ\u201d line are estimated based on how the data plots within graph iii and assuming no additional reactions beyond inorganic carbon species changes have occurred within the closed system. The initial estimated value for the 14C constant line is 50 percent modern carbon, assuming half of the radiocarbon has been released or decayed before the system closed. The initially estimated value for the \u03b413C constant line is dependent upon the dominant vegetation type: between -30 and-20\u2030 for type C3 plants and between -20 and -15\u2030 for type C4 plants. These \u03b413C concentrations are then divided in half to re\ufb02ect the enrichment of \u03b413C due to additional carbon introduced into groundwater system 30 with carbonate mineral dissolution and fractionation during the reactions from CO2 gas to aqueous carbonate. For the Han plots, the Salt Basin was divided into \ufb01ve groups correspond- ing to geologic provinces with carbon data. These geologic provinces are: NM Carbonates, TX Cretaceous, TX Victorio Peak, TX Capitan, and TX Salt Flats. The 14C and \u03b413C of Salt Basin soil CO2 was measured to be approximately 70 percent modern carbon and -22\u2030, respectively [20]. The \u03b413C value was halved to adjust for carbonate dissolution, resulting in a constant \u03b413C line of -11\u2030. Hence, the lines perpendicular to the appropriate axis was drawn at -11\u2030 for \u03b413C and at 70 percent modern carbon for carbon-14. The \u03b413C value was determined for the Sacramento Mountains. Assuming the majority of recharge occurs within these high elevations, the measured -11\u2030 for \u03b413C is used for all of the \ufb02ow paths/geological provinces. The southern Salt Basin did not have a measured soil CO2 carbon-14. For this region and associated \ufb02ow paths/geological provinces, the initially estimated value of 50 pmC was used for the constant 14C line. For the combination of the TX Cretaceous and TX Victorio Peak, an average value of 60 pmC was used for the constant carbon-14 line. 2.4.1 Expected Han Plots Trends Each region and combination of regions of the three carbon graphs are associ- ated to different fractionation pathways that can modify the relative concentrations of carbon. Region 2 is representative of dedolomitization. This process is associated with low radiocarbon activities, low dissolved inorganic carbon, and enriched \u03b413C. As the gypsum and dolomite dissolve, the bicarbonate released enriches the solution in \u03b413C. The calcite precipitation preferentially incorporates the lighter dissolved inorganic carbon. Throughout this process, the radiocarbon decays and results in a low radiocarbon groundwater. The overall process of incongruent dissolution is associated with the X(b) lines on graphs i and ii. Dedolomitization is an example of incongruent dissolution, where one mineral is dissolved into solution and another mineral is precipitated out. The X(b) line is also associated with isotopic exchange between water and carbonates. This reaction does not change the 1/DIC. The reaction exchanges radiocarbon and/or carbon-13 for carbon-12, which changes the percent modern carbon of radiocarbon and \u03b413C in the groundwaters. Region 6 is not speci\ufb01cally connected with any one process. Instead, region 6 is representative of multiple processes, including incongruent dissolution, isotopic exchange, radiocarbon decay, and mixing. Interpretation of data points within this region depend upon where the points are on graph i and graph ii. Points that are not along process lines or have a distribution within a shaded region are likely caused by mixing processes and multiple water sources. A full 31 summary of these regions, lines, and combined regions, as well as the associated reactions, can be found in Han et al. (2012)[2]. 2.5 Radiocarbon Corrections The radioactive decay of radiocarbon (carbon-14 or 14C) can be utilized to estimate the average subsurface"

The reaction exchanges radiocarbon and/or carbon-13 for carbon-12, which changes the percent modern carbon of radiocarbon and \u03b413C in the groundwaters. Region 6 is not speci\ufb01cally connected with any one process. Instead, region 6 is representative of multiple processes, including incongruent dissolution, isotopic exchange, radiocarbon decay, and mixing. Interpretation of data points within this region depend upon where the points are on graph i and graph ii. Points that are not along process lines or have a distribution within a shaded region are likely caused by mixing processes and multiple water sources. A full 31 summary of these regions, lines, and combined regions, as well as the associated reactions, can be found in Han et al. (2012)[2]. 2.5 Radiocarbon Corrections The radioactive decay of radiocarbon (carbon-14 or 14C) can be utilized to estimate the average subsurface residence time of the groundwater. In order to convert from measured and initial carbon-14 activities to groundwater age in years, the following equation was used t = \u22125730 ln(2) ln( 14Cinitial 14Cmeasured ) (2.1) Generally, older waters have lower radiocarbon activities. However, this age-dating requires knowledge of the 14C initial activity. The initial concentration of radiocarbon can vary depending upon physical and chemical processes [2]. Depending upon the dominant processes, there are some potential corrections that can be applied to the measured activity. Referring to Figure 2.3 and Han et al. (2012) [2], it is possible to determine the dominant pathways and correct for those changes. As mentioned previously, dedolomitization is likely a dominant alteration process in the Salt Basin [11, 14, 17, 74]. This process corresponds to Region 2 of Figure 2.3. Sigstedt (2010) [14] performed a radiocarbon correction for dedolomiti- zation along the Pi\u02dcnon Creek \ufb02ow path. Those results will be discussed in further detail later. A general correction model, the Fontes and Garnier model, was applied to all of the carbon data points within the Salt Basin [18]. The Fontes and Garnier model adds an isotopic exchange correction factor onto the Tamers radiocarbon equation. Using sample pH to determine the amount of carbon-14 within the total dissolved carbon content, the Tamers equation is Ao,Tamers = 2(10\u2212pH) + 10\u22126.3 2(10\u2212pH + 10\u22126.3 + 10\u221210.3+pH\u22126.3) \u00d7 100 (2.2) Adding the correction term onto this, the Fontes and Garnier full equation is given as Ao,F&G = Ao,Tamers + (Ag \u22120.2\u03f5 \u2212AM) \u03b4T \u2212CM CT \u03b4M \u2212(1 \u2212CM CT )\u03b4g \u03b4g \u2212\u03f5 \u2212\u03b4M (2.3) The radiocarbon activity of the soil gas (Ag) and the average radiocarbon activity of dissolving carbonate minerals (AM) are given in percent modern carbon 32 (pmC). The additive fractionation factor (\u03f5), the total \u03b413C of the sample (\u03b4T), the \u03b413C of the carbonate minerals (\u03b4M), and the \u03b413C of the soil gas (\u03b4g) are given in per mil. Lastly, the concentration of carbon from carbonate mineral dissolution (CM) and the concentration of total DIC in the groundwater sample (CT) are given in mmol/L. Table 2.1 has a summary of these variables. The corrected initial activity of carbon-14 is dependent upon the sample pH, measured 14C activity, and the concentrations of DIC and \u03b413C in the sample, soil gas, and carbonate minerals. This corrected initial activity was used in the radiocarbon age equation to get a groundwater age that has been corrected to pH and isotopic exchange. Since this correction was not speci\ufb01c to any geological province or chemical process beyond isotopic exchange, there is limited reliability in these corrected radiocarbon ages, speci\ufb01cally where there is dedolomitization occurring. Variable De\ufb01nition Units Ag radiocarbon activity pmC of CO2 gas in soil \u03f5 additive fractionation factor per mil, \u2030 AM average radiocarbon activity pmC of dissolving carbonate mineral \u03b4T total \u03b413C of sample per mil, \u2030 CM concentration of carbon mmol/L from carbonate mineral dissolution CT concentration of total DIC mmol/L in groundwater sample \u03b4M \u03b413C of carbonate minerals per mil, \u2030 \u03b4g \u03b413C of soil CO2 gas per mil, \u2030 Table 2.1: Fontes and Garnier radiocarbon full equation variables [18] There is a possibility that the heterogeneous fractures of the southwestern Salt Basin cause a mixing of young and old waters and thus would effectively negate the use of the Fontes and Garnier radiocarbon correction [18]. Hence, a simple mixing model between a young and an old end member could better represent this heterogeneous \ufb02ow system. An equation to represent this mixing is Ao,mixing = 14Cmeasured \u221214 Cold(1 \u2212f ) f (2.4) where f = ( Ca Na)measured \u2212( Ca Na)old ( Ca Na)young \u2212( Ca Na)old (2.5) 33 With the correction factor (f), the corrected initial radiocarbon activity is calculated from the measured radiocarbon activity. The correction factor in this mixing model utilized calcium to sodium ratios of waters with high and low concentrations of measured radiocarbon activities. These ratios of calcium to sodium would also designate fresh and recently recharged precipitation versus saline and old waters. Just as the Fontes and Garnier corrected initial activity was put into the radiocarbon age equation to calculate a corrected groundwater age, the corrected initial activity from this mixing model was used to calculate a corrected groundwater age for the southwestern Salt Basin. 34 Figure 2.3: Recreated from [2]; Three graphical constructs to interpret carbon data (regions are highlighted and labeled based on dominant processes associated with each region, refer to [2] for further explanation 35 CHAPTER 3 GROUNDWATER CHEMISTRY RESULTS 3.1 Basin-Wide The delineation of groundwater \ufb02ow paths in the Salt Basin closely followed the sub-watersheds and groundwater potentiometric surface and resulted in ten major \ufb02ow paths (Figure 3.1). Geological provinces were separated into seven provinces to group similar geologic facies with adjacent \ufb02ow paths (Figure 3.2). While individual \ufb02ow paths and geological provinces were closely analyzed independently, the overall Salt Basin chemistry was also reviewed to determine if there were any basin-wide dominant chemical evolution processes.

Geological provinces were separated into seven provinces to group similar geologic facies with adjacent \ufb02ow paths (Figure 3.2). While individual \ufb02ow paths and geological provinces were closely analyzed independently, the overall Salt Basin chemistry was also reviewed to determine if there were any basin-wide dominant chemical evolution processes. Figure 3.1: Salt Basin hydrochemistry points, color-coded by \ufb02ow path 36 Figure 3.2: Salt Basin hydrochemistry points, color-coded by geologic province 3.1.1 Basin-Wide\u2013 Hydrochemical Trends To encompass the major ions that are expected in this primarily carbonate sys- tem, the mapped chemical ratios of mmol/L to mmol/L were sulfate-to-chloride, calcium-to-magnesium and sodium-to-magnesium. The sulfate-to-chloride ratio shows sulfate dominance in the northern Salt Basin (Figure 3.3). Chloride gener- ally becomes increasingly prevalent moving southwards. There is an anomalously high chloride dominated groundwater sample in the high elevations of the Sacra- mento Mountains. Dell City, TX has a clear transition from sulfate-dominated groundwaters to chloride-dominated groundwaters moving southwards. There are a few areas in the southern Salt Basin that still contain high ratios of sulfate-to- chloride, most evidently along the Salt Flats along the southern Salt Basin margin. Antelope Draw and South Well Draw also contain intermediate sulfate-to-chloride ratios A trend in calcium-to-magnesium ratios is less prominent, but still shows a general increase in calcium moving southwards (Figure 3.4). The high elevations of the Sacramento Mountains are calcium dominated. Shiloh Draw, Dell City, and the Salt Flats each show a mixture of calcium-to-magnesium ratios, calcium-rich ratios, and magnesium-rich ratios. The Sacramento River, Pi\u02dcnon Creek, and Cornucopia 37 Figure 3.3: Salt Basin hydrochemistry points, color-coded by sulfate-to-chloride ratios of mmol/L:mmol/L; points dominated by chloride are more red Draw \ufb02ow paths tend to be higher in calcium, compared to the Antelope Draw and South Well Draw \ufb02ow paths. Sodium-to-magnesium ratios follow the same trend as sulfate-to-chloride, with a general increase in sodium moving southwards (Figure 3.5). The New Mexico portion of the Salt Basin is dominated by high magnesium. There are a few points with high sodium around the Cornudas Mountains within Shiloh Draw. Another area with high magnesium appears around the Capitan \ufb02ow path along the eastern Salt Basin margin. Like with the sulfate-to-chloride ratio, Dell City, TX shows a clear transition between magnesium-dominated groundwaters changing to sodium-dominated groundwaters moving southwards. Groundwater and precipitation deuterium and oxygen-18 isotopic composi- tions from the Salt Basin are plotted together to visualize the transition between the two waters (Figure 3.6). Average precipitation is around -70\u2030 \u03b4D and -11\u2030 \u03b418O. Average groundwater is around -60\u2030 \u03b4D and -9\u2030 \u03b418O. There is a wide distribution of precipitation values. Groundwaters are more concentrated around the average. Overall, the groundwater is more enriched than the precipitation. Due to additional oxygen-18, the groundwater average is below the precipitation LMWL. Figure 3.7 shows the distribution of the groundwater points and the corre- 38 Figure 3.4: Salt Basin hydrochemistry points, color-coded by calcium-to- magnesium ratios of mmol/L:mmol/L; points dominated by calcium are more red sponding \u03b418O. Spatially, there are no clear trends in \u03b418O. If there were continuous evaporation along \ufb02ow paths, the result would be increasing values moving from the headwaters toward the Salt Flats. Flow paths with constant \u03b418O values are indicative of limited or no isotopic fractionation within the aquifer. Where local recharge occurs, for example focused recharge from arroyo bed in\ufb01ltration, the groundwater may gain the signature of the in\ufb01ltrating summer monsoon stormwa- ter. But this precipitated water may have a wide range of \u03b418O values (Figure 3.6). There are few, if any, clear patterns in Figure 3.7, though the low \u03b418O values in the Sacramento Mountains are consistent with snowmelt-derived recharge in that mountain range. 3.1.2 Basin-Wide\u2013 Han Plots Plotting all of the Salt Basin carbon data onto one set of Han plots can be used to highlight the major basin-wide processes (Figure 3.8). The carbon points are primarily within Region 2 and Region 6, with a few points in Region 4 and Region 39 Figure 3.5: Salt Basin hydrochemistry points, color-coded by sodium-to- magnesium ratios of mmol/L:mmol/L; points dominated by sodium are more red 1. Region 2 and Region 6 are associated with dedolomitization, incongruent dissolution, isotopic exchange, radiocarbon decay, and mixing [2]. Region 4 and Region 1 are associated with methanogenesis and degassing, respectively [2]). However, upon further inspection and realignment of the constant lines based on hydrogeologic region-speci\ufb01c data, the point in Region 4 is relocated into Region 6. The point in Region 1 is given an alternative explanation for its positioning. Nonetheless, the basin-wide Han plots make it dif\ufb01cult to see where and why each process is occurring. Hence, the Han plots are separated by geological province to give spatial context to each of the processes. 3.1.3 Basin-Wide\u2013 Radiocarbon Analyses The Fontes and Garnier correction method was applied to the basin-wide carbon data points to correct for isotopic exchange (Table 3.1). Table 3.2 shows the values used for the environmental parameters in the Fontes and Garnier equation and from Table 2.1. The radiocarbon value for soil gas was set to 100 percent 40 Figure 3.6: Salt Basin precipitation and groundwater deuterium and \u03b418O values; trend line equations are provided in respective colors beneath the legend modern carbon. The radiocarbon value for the dissolving carbonate minerals was set to 0 percent modern carbon. The additive fraction factor was set to -10 per mil. From Sigstedt (2010) [14], the \u03b413C of the carbonate minerals was set to 5.7 per mil. From Morse (2010) [20], the \u03b413C of the soil gas was set to -22 per mil. However, this general correction method and the resulting groundwater ages lack geological and spatial connection. Instead of the F&G corrected radiocar- bon ages, the measured radiocarbon activities were used as a basis for general age trends. Figure 3.9 shows the basin-wide measured radiocarbon activities in per- cent modern carbon. Subsequent geologic provinces will have province-speci\ufb01c corrected groundwater ages. There is an overall trend of decreasing radiocarbon activities moving southwards through the Salt Basin, which usually correspond to older waters. Radiocarbon activities are listed in Appendix A.1. There is a general trend towards older corrected ages with lower measured radiocarbon activities and lighter \u03b413C"

The Yeso formation is characterized as limestone and dolomite interbed- ded with gypsum, siltstone, and shale [14, 31, 45, 46]. The San Andres formation is characterized as dolomites interbedded with shale and sandstone [14, 31, 46]. Within this geological province, there are four major \ufb02ow paths: Pi\u02dcnon Creek, Cornucopia Draw, Sacramento River, and Shiloh Draw. The Cornudas Mountains igneous intrusion is also contained within Shiloh Draw. These \ufb02ow paths \ufb02ow through the New Mexico Carbonate province before moving through Dell City, TX and discharging into the Salt Flats province. These connections will be discussed in further detail later. 3.2.1 NM Carbonates\u2013 Hydrochemical Trends The Pi\u02dcnon Creek is dominated by calcium and sulfate, both showing an increase along the \ufb02ow path (Figure 3.11a). Counter to a slight increase in mag- nesium, there is a slight decrease in bicarbonate. There is some variability in 42 the constituents moving southwards, but there is a general trend towards higher constituent concentrations in the south. There is minimal sodium and potassium throughout the Pi\u02dcnon Creek. On the Piper diagram, the \ufb02ow direction is desig- nated by the red arrows. The beginning of the Pi\u02dcnon Creek \ufb02ow path has high bicarbonate, low chloride, low sulfate, a mixture between calcium and magnesium, and low sodium and potassium. The end of the \ufb02ow path has low bicarbonate, low chloride, high sulfate, a mixture between calcium and magnesium, and low sodium and potassium. The average calcium-to-magnesium ratio is approximately one-to-one. The Sacramento River is also dominated by calcium and sulfate, both show- ing an increase along the \ufb02ow path (Figure 3.12a). While the remainder of the constituents increase, there is a decrease in bicarbonate moving towards the south. There is minimal sodium and potassium throughout the entire \ufb02ow regime. A third of the way along the \ufb02ow path, there is a slight decrease in constituents. This de\ufb01cit is replenished and compounded further southwards. The arrows on the Piper diagrams designate \ufb02ow from north to south. The beginning of the Sacramento River \ufb02ow path has high bicarbonate, low chloride, low sulfate, with intermediate concentrations of calcium and magnesium and low concentrations of sodium and potassium. Similar to the Pi\u02dcnon Creek \ufb02ow path, the end point of the Sacramento River has low path has low bicarbonate, low chloride, high sulfate, a mixture between calcium and magnesium, and low sodium and potassium. The calcium-to-magnesium ratio is maintained at a one-to-one ratio. The Cornucopia Draw is in-between the Sacramento River and Pi\u02dcnon Creek, and also shares a similar chemistry (Figure 3.13a). This draw is dominated by calcium and sulfate, both showing a slight increase along the \ufb02ow path. There is a spike in constituents towards the beginning of the \ufb02ow path. Nonetheless, there is an increase in most constituents, with the exception of bicarbonate and sodium. The former has a slight decrease, while the latter is minimal throughout the entire Cornucopia Draw. The arrows on the Piper diagram designate the \ufb02ow direction along the Cornucopia Draw from north to south. From the beginning point to the end point, there is not much change in cation concentrations. The anions start with high bicarbonate, low chloride, and low sulfate. The end point has decreased bicarbonate, unchanged chloride, and increased sulfate concentrations. On the Piper diagram, the calcium-to-magnesium ratio is approximately one-to-one. Shiloh Draw \ufb02ows in a different direction from the rest of the New Mexico \ufb02ow paths, from west to east, and still \ufb02ows towards Dell City, TX. The majority of Shiloh Draw is dominated by sulfate and calcium (Figure 3.14a). Bicarbonate and magnesium are secondary anions and cations, respectively. There is a spike in sodium a third of the way along the Shiloh Draw \ufb02ow path, but this high concentration is not sustained along the remainder of the \ufb02ow path. There is not a consistent trend on the Piper diagram, but the graph suggests a slight increase in constituents moving along the \ufb02ow path. The arrows designate the \ufb02ow path from west to east.. The anions show a decrease in bicarbonate and an increase in sulfate while the chloride concentration remains low. On the cation triangle, there is an increase in calcium with an increase in magnesium and decrease in sodium and potassium while maintaining a calcium-to-magnesium one-to-one 43 ratio However, there is high variability in constituent concentrations, so there is high uncertainty in any trends from Shiloh Draw data. 3.2.2 NM Carbonates\u2013 Han Plots The Han plots, based on Han et al. (2012) [2], for the carbonates within the New Mexico portion of the Salt Basin are shown in Figure 3.15. All three of the graphs show a trend of enriching \u03b413C, decreasing radiocarbon percent modern carbon, and a decrease in dissolved inorganic carbon (an increase in 1/DIC). Hence, there must be a source of enriched \u03b413C that contributes to the DIC as the radiocarbon is removed from the groundwater or decays from the system. In each graph, the trend continues on either side of the Z diagonal line. This departure from a singular region means there is likely mixing of multiple carbon sources, but this mixing has minimal affect as shown by the general grouping of the carbon points.

Graph iii shows the majority of the points beneath the Z diagonal line. 3.2.3 NM Carbonates\u2013 Radiocarbon Analyses Fontes and Garnier radiocarbon corrections were applied to the carbon data in the NM Carbonates geologic province (Table 3.1). However, this method corrected for isotopic exchange, and it does not account for radiocarbon activity changes due to incongruent dissolution, such as dedolomitization. Measured radiocarbon activities in the NM Carbonates range from 8.19 to 67.7 pmC (Figure 3.9). Since this method corrected for isotopic exchange, it does account for radiocar- bon activities due to incongruent dissolution, such as dedolomitization. Sigstedt (2010) [14] conducted a detailed chemical analysis of Pi\u02dcnon Creek. During which, it was concluded that dedolomitization was a dominant process along this \ufb02ow path. A dedolomitization-speci\ufb01c radiocarbon correction method was applied using the NETPATH model. NETPATH is an inverse, mass balance model that uses hydrochemical data to perform mass transfer reactions, Raleigh distillation calculations, and model comparisons [14, 19]. Further, it is possible to specify processes within the overall NETPATH model. In Sigstedt (2010) [14], dedolomiti- zation was included in the model by having gypsum and dolomite dissolution and calcite precipitation. The radiocarbon corrections in NETPATH also included speci\ufb01ed input values for the carbonate aquifer of \u03b413C equal to 5.7\u2030 [14]. For more detail regarding this correction, refer to Sigstedt (2010) [14]. The NETPATH- corrected radiocarbon ages from Sigstedt (2010) [14] are shown in Figure 3.16. Like the Fontes and Garnier corrections, there is a trend of increasing residence time moving southwards. The range of ages from Sigstedt (2010) [14] is 3,500 to 16,600 years. 44 3.3 Texas\u2013 Cretaceous Province The Texas Cretaceous province contains the Finlay limestone and Pump Sta- tion Hills rhyolite porphyry. The Finlay formation is characterized as a Cretaceous limestone with secondary permeability due to carbonate dissolution and minor faulting. The Pump Station Hills rhyolite porphyry is characterized as a coarsely and heterogeneously fractured Precambrian unit. Within this geological province, there are two major \ufb02ow paths: W.Antelope Draw and W.South Well Draw. These \ufb02ow paths begin in the Cretaceous province, but later \ufb02ow through the Victorio Peak province as E.Antelope and E.South Well before discharging into the Salt Flats province. These connections will be discussed in further detail later. 3.3.1 TX Cretaceous\u2013 Hydrochemical Trends The W.Antelope Draw \ufb02ows parallel to the Shiloh Draw, but resides in the Texas portion of the Salt Basin. The chemistry of W.Antelope Draw is shown in Figure 3.17a. The constituents graph shows an initial peak in concentrations towards the headwaters of this \ufb02ow path with a decrease in components further along the \ufb02ow path towards the Salt Flats. The W.Antelope Draw Piper diagram shows intermediate anions, low calcium, high magnesium, and high sodium and potassium. There is one point of high chloride in W.Antelope Draw. Due to the lack of supporting evidence to suggest a simple \ufb02ow path through this draw, there are no arrows showing \ufb02ow direction on the Piper diagram. Instead, there is a line to designate chemical trends. The chemical trend of W.Antelope Draw highlights an increase in calcium, increase in magnesium, and a decrease in sodium and potassium that produces a calcium-to-magnesium ratio of one-to-one. The W.South Well Draw parallels the W.Antelope Draw in the southwestern Salt Basin. The chemical constituents\u2019 graph and Piper diagram for this draw are shown in Figure 3.18a. This \ufb02ow path is characterized by increasing constituents moving towards the Salt Flats to the east. The majority of these constituents are added to the groundwater two-thirds of the way along the W.South Well Draw \ufb02ow path. The Piper diagram shows a range of bicarbonate, a range of chloride, and consistently low sulfate concentrations. The general trend of increasing chloride with decreasing bicarbonate and unchanging sulfate is designated by the line within the anion triangle. The cations are mostly low calcium, low magnesium, and high sodium and potassium. Since there is one point that shows increasing calcium, increasing magnesium, and decreasing sodium and potassium trend, there is a trend line added to the cation triangle. This trend line is approximately a one-to-one ratio of calcium-to-magnesium. The overall trend of anions and cations appears on the ternary diamond and is highlighted with a line. 45 3.3.2 TX Cretaceous\u2013 Han Plots The carbon data from W.Antelope Draw and W.South Well Draw are shown in the Han plots in Figure 3.19. The points are separated by color based on the points position with respect to the vertical axis in the \ufb01rst graph (red = right, higher 1/DIC, blue = left, lower 1/DIC). For the red points, there is a trend of enriching \u03b413C, decreasing radiocarbon percent modern carbon, and a decrease in dissolved inorganic carbon (an increase in 1/DIC). This is the same trend as the NM Carbonates. There is also an anomalous point with high radiocarbon (\u00bf90 pmC) that suggests an in\ufb02uential source of radiocarbon or recently recharged waters. The blue points are generally clustered around low radiocarbon activities, but have a range of \u03b413C and 1/DIC. This range of \u03b413C and 1/DIC parallels the Z diagonal line in graph i. Graph i and graph ii show the majority of the blue Salt Basin carbon data on the left side of the vertical axis, but still above or below the Z line, respectively. Graph iii shows the majority of the points beneath"

This trend line is approximately a one-to-one ratio of calcium-to-magnesium. The overall trend of anions and cations appears on the ternary diamond and is highlighted with a line. 45 3.3.2 TX Cretaceous\u2013 Han Plots The carbon data from W.Antelope Draw and W.South Well Draw are shown in the Han plots in Figure 3.19. The points are separated by color based on the points position with respect to the vertical axis in the \ufb01rst graph (red = right, higher 1/DIC, blue = left, lower 1/DIC). For the red points, there is a trend of enriching \u03b413C, decreasing radiocarbon percent modern carbon, and a decrease in dissolved inorganic carbon (an increase in 1/DIC). This is the same trend as the NM Carbonates. There is also an anomalous point with high radiocarbon (\u00bf90 pmC) that suggests an in\ufb02uential source of radiocarbon or recently recharged waters. The blue points are generally clustered around low radiocarbon activities, but have a range of \u03b413C and 1/DIC. This range of \u03b413C and 1/DIC parallels the Z diagonal line in graph i. Graph i and graph ii show the majority of the blue Salt Basin carbon data on the left side of the vertical axis, but still above or below the Z line, respectively. Graph iii shows the majority of the points beneath the Z diagonal line. 3.3.3 TX Cretaceous\u2013 Radiocarbon Analyses A general groundwater residence time for the groundwaters in the Texas Cretaceous was determined using the Fontes & Garnier radiocarbon age correction method. The results from this correction are included in Table 3.1. There is a lack of trend in these corrected radiocarbon ages and a lack of trend in measured radiocarbon activities; young waters and juxtaposed with old waters (Figure 3.9). Further, there are younger waters further along the \ufb02ow path with older waters near the Salt Basin margin. The overall radiocarbon activity range is from 4.34 to 90.77 pmC. Since there was no clear radiocarbon age trend from the general Fontes and Garnier correction method, a mixing of young and old waters resulted in another correction factor for the initial radiocarbon activities. Figure 3.20 shows the resulting mixing corrected radiocarbon ages that were extended down the length of Antelope Draw and South Well Draw. This spatial extension included the possibility of the two-waters mixing system of the Cretaceous geologic province continuing beneath and contributing to the Victorio Peak geologic province. Using a young calcium to sodium ratio of 10 and an old ratio of 0.1, the corrected ages are listed in Table 3.3. The corrected ages range from 542 years to 26,000 years. The negative corrected ages were removed because the negative corrected age suggests the mixing correction equation was invalid for those points. There is a trend towards higher carbon to sodium ratios and lower measured radiocarbon activities for the older points (Figure 3.21). This trend suggests dedolomitization is occurring within the old waters in the aquifer matrix, but not within the young waters moving through the fractures and mixing in the two-waters mixing system. Even with this mixing correction, there is not a clear 46 trend of increasing or decreasing corrected radiocarbon groundwater age within the Cretaceous geologic province. 3.4 Texas\u2013 Victorio Peak Province The Texas Victorio Peak province contains the Victorio Peak. This formation is characterized as limestone and dolomite interbedded with siliceous shale and sandstone [23]. Within this geological province, there are two major \ufb02ow paths: E.Antelope Draw and E.South Well Draw. These \ufb02ow paths begin in the Cretaceous province as W.Antelope and W.South Well Draw, but later \ufb02ow through the Victorio Peak province before discharging into the Salt Flats province. These connections will be discussed in further detail later. 3.4.1 TX Victorio Peak\u2013 Hydrochemical Trends The E.Antelope Draw \ufb02ows begins when the W.Antelope Draw \ufb02ow path leaves the Cretaceous geologic province and enters the Victorio Peak carbonate. This transition zone is between the two red vertical lines on the components plot. There is a slight increase in TDS and an early spike in chloride, but the rest of the components remain relatively unchanged in the second half of the \ufb02ow system, within the Victorio Peak geologic province. The Piper diagram in Figure 3.22a contains both the W.Antelope Draw and E.Antelope Draw data in light green and dark green, respectively. The two halves of the \ufb02ow path have similar chemistry, but the E.Antelope Draw has overall less bicarbonate, more chloride, more sulfate, more calcium, more magnesium, and less sodium and potassium. Due to the lack of supporting evidence to suggest a simple \ufb02ow path through this draw, there are no arrows showing \ufb02ow direction on the Piper diagram. Instead, there is a line to designate chemical trends. The chemical trend of E.Antelope Draw highlights a trend of increasing calcium with increasing magnesium and decreasing sodium and potassium with a calcium-to-magnesium ratio of one-to-one that is shared in the W.Antelope Draw Piper diagram. The total of South Well Draw is primarily within W.South Well Draw, but there are a few additional points from within E.South Well Draw (Figure 3.23a). Shortly before entering the Victorio Peak carbonate, the South Well Draw has a decrease in components. This decreasing trend is continued within E.South Well Draw. As before, the transition zone between the Cretaceous geologic province and the Victorio Peak carbonate province is designated with the two red vertical lines in the components plot. The Piper diagram is also separated into two colors: white with gray outline is W.South Well Draw, just gray is E.South Well Draw. The trend lines on the Piper diagram designate the increase in chloride with decreasing bicarbonate and unchanging sulfate and the one-to-one ratio of calcium- to-magnesium. With the increasing calcium, the trend line shows the increase in 47 magnesium and decrease in sodium and potassium. The overall trend of anions and cations appears on the ternary diamond and is highlighted with a line. The E.South Well data plots within the W.South Well data on the Piper diagram and does not have any additional aspects. 3.4.2 TX Victorio Peak\u2013 Han Plots The carbon data from Antelope Draw and South Well Draw are shown in the Han plots in Figure 3.24. The points are separated by color based on the geologic province: red = eastern \ufb02ow paths in Victorio Peak, blue = western \ufb02ow paths in Cretaceous. The red points are the focus of this section, but require the blue points for context. There is a trend of enriching \u03b413C, near constant radiocarbon percent modern carbon, and a decrease in dissolved inorganic carbon (an increase in 1/DIC). This trend is similar to that of the NM Carbonates and TX Cretaceous. However, the Victorio Peak carbon points tend to have higher 1/DIC, or lower DIC,"

The points are separated by color based on the geologic province: red = eastern \ufb02ow paths in Victorio Peak, blue = western \ufb02ow paths in Cretaceous. The red points are the focus of this section, but require the blue points for context. There is a trend of enriching \u03b413C, near constant radiocarbon percent modern carbon, and a decrease in dissolved inorganic carbon (an increase in 1/DIC). This trend is similar to that of the NM Carbonates and TX Cretaceous. However, the Victorio Peak carbon points tend to have higher 1/DIC, or lower DIC, and lower radiocarbon activities. Hence, there must be a source of enriched \u03b413C that contributes to the DIC. Further, the groundwaters likely have long residence times and dispersed water sources to produce the consistently low radiocarbon activity. The majority of the red Victorio Peak carbon data points are within Region 2 and Region 6 on the Han plots. 3.4.3 TX Victorio Peak\u2013 Radiocarbon Analyses The Fontes and Garnier method corrected radiocarbon activities along the E.Antelope and E.South Well to produce a corrected radiocarbon age (Table 3.1). Within the measured radiocarbon activities, there is a slight trend of younger waters towards the east. However, this trend is counter to the expected trend of older waters further along the \ufb02ow path. The overall range of radiocarbon activities is 5.36 to 49.5 pmC. The mixing radiocarbon corrections were extended into the Victorio Peak geologic province from the Cretaceous geologic province, and those results were presented previously. 3.5 Texas\u2013 Capitan Reef Province The Texas Capitan Reef province contains the Capitan Reef complex. This complex is characterized as high permeability limestone and dolomite interbedded with sandstone0 [31, 56]. Within this geological province, there is one major \ufb02ow path: Capitan \ufb02ow path. This \ufb02ow path begins in the Capitan Reef province, but discharges into the Salt Flats province. These connections will be discussed in further detail later. 48 3.5.1 TX Capitan Reef\u2013 Hydrochemical Trends The chemistry of the Capitan \ufb02ow path is shown in Figure 3.25a. There are a few spikes of high TDS, sodium, and chloride moving from north to south. A slight overall decrease in bicarbonate counters a slight overall increase in sulfate. Generally, the concentrations of the components do not have an increasing or decreasing trend throughout the Capitan \ufb02ow path. The Piper diagram of Capitan data points has an anion and cation trend, but no diamond ternary trend. The anions show an increase of chloride with decreasing concentrations of bicarbonate and unchanging sulfate. For the cations, there is a trend of increasing calcium with increasing magnesium and decreasing sodium to potassium, producing an overall calcium-to-magnesium ratio of one-to-one. 3.5.2 TX Capitan Reef\u2013 Han Plots While there are only four carbon data points within the Capitan geologic province, the Han plots can help determine the dominant processes occurring within this geologic province. Figure 3.26 shows the three Han plots for the Capitan geologic province. All of the carbon points are within Region 2 or Region 6. There is minimal range between the 1/DIC, \u03b413C, and radiocarbon values. There is a slight trend of enriching \u03b413C, near constant radiocarbon percent modern carbon, and a decrease in dissolved inorganic carbon (an increase in 1/DIC). This trend is similar to that of the NM Carbonates, TX Cretaceous, and TX Victorio Peak. 3.5.3 TX Capitan Reef\u2013 Radiocarbon Analyses The four carbon points in the Capitan geologic province show a general increase in age moving southwards (Figure 3.9). These activities align with the trend from Fontes and Garnier radiocarbon corrections listed in Table 3.1. The overall range of radiocarbon activities from 12.1 to 24.2 pmC for the Capitan geologic province. 3.6 New Mexico\u2013 Artesia Group Province The New Mexico Artesia Group province contains the Artesia Group complex. This complex is characterized as dolomite interbedded with sandstone [31, 46]. Within this geological province, there is one major \ufb02ow path: Big Dog Canyon. This \ufb02ow path begins in the Artesia Group province, but is redirected towards the west and discharges into the Salt Flats province. These connections will be discussed in further detail later. There are no carbon data in the Artesia Group geologic province. Hence, there are no Han plots or radiocarbon analyses. 49 3.6.1 NM Artesia Group\u2013 Hydrochemical Trends Big Dog Canyon has two data points. Consequently, there is limited chemical evolutionary trends to be seen. Figure 3.27a shows the chemical composition of these two points as they would change moving along the \ufb02ow path from south to north. There is an increase in the majority of the constituents, with the exception of a decrease in bicarbonate concentration. The Piper diagram for Big Dog/Artesia group shows a two-point trend towards increasing TDS, decreasing bicarbonate, constant chloride, increasing sulfate, increasing calcium, decreasing magnesium, and constant sodium and potassium. 3.7 Dell City, TX\u2013 Bone Spring/Victorio Peak Province The Dell City, TX Bone Spring/Victorio Peak province contains the Bone Spring and Victorio Peak carbonates. The Bone Spring formation and Victorio Peak formation are characterized as limestone and dolomite interbedded with siliceous shale and sandstone [23]. Within this geological province, there is one major \ufb02ow path: Dell City, TX. This \ufb02ow path is a combination of the Pi\u02dcnon Creek, Cornucopia Draw, Sacramento River, and Shiloh Draw waters before the ground- water discharges into the Salt Flats province. These connections will be discussed in further detail later. There is no carbon data in the Bone Spring/Victorio Peak geologic province. Hence, there are no Han plots or radiocarbon analyses 3.7.1 Dell City, TX\u2013 Hydrochemical Trends Dell City, TX has a signi\ufb01cant amount of chemistry data points, likely due to agriculture and population. Figure 3.28a shows the chemistry of Dell City. The graph of constituents is complicated by the multitude of points. Regardless, there is a slight decrease in most constituents moving southwards through Dell City. The increasing components are chloride and sodium. Average TDS remains constant moving southwards through Dell City. On the Piper diagram, the Dell City points are focused along the low"

Regardless, there is a slight decrease in most constituents moving southwards through Dell City. The increasing components are chloride and sodium. Average TDS remains constant moving southwards through Dell City. On the Piper diagram, the Dell City points are focused along the low bicarbonate side of the anion triangle and in the center of the cation triangle. There is a range of sulfate for the consistently low bicarbonate and range of chloride concentrations. The trend shows an increase in chloride with a decrease in sulfate. The calcium-to-magnesium ratio is maintained at a one-to-one ratio. The cation triangle shows an increase in calcium with an increase in magnesium and a decrease in sodium and potassium. The two trends are also seen on the diamond ternary plot with high chloride and sulfate concentrations corresponding to a range of calcium and magnesium. 50 3.8 Texas\u2013 Salt Flats Province The Texas Salt Flats province contains the Salt Flats and playas. These playas are characterized as gypsum, halite, calcite, dolomite, and quartz sediments with high evaporative potential [13, 25, 31, 58, 59]. This \ufb02ow path is the terminus path of all of the Salt Basin groundwater as it is evaporated from the playa surface [13, 25]. The Salt Flats groundwater \ufb02ows from the playas to the northeast of Dell City, through Dell City, and towards the southern margin of the Salt Basin. These connections will be discussed in further detail later. 3.8.1 TX Salt Flats\u2013 Hydrochemical Trends The Salt Flats have a chemical signature similar to the rest of the Salt Basin. The chemistry of the Salt Flats is shown in Figure 3.29a. There is variability in the concentrations of constituents. Due to an early peak of chloride and sodium, there is a slight decrease in the concentration of these components further southwards. There are also a few spikes of chloride, sodium, and potassium throughout the remainder of the Salt Flats \ufb02ow path. The Piper diagram shows a range of anions with a calcium-to-magnesium ratio of one-to-one throughout. Increasing calcium trends with increasing magnesium and decreasing sodium and potassium. There is a slight trend of increasing bicarbonate with decreasing chloride and increasing sulfate. Overall, the Salt Flats chemistry points are spread throughout the diamond ternary plot, showing slight preference towards higher chloride and sulfate 3.8.2 TX Salt Flats\u2013 Han Plots The six carbon data points for the Salt Flats geologic province are plotted onto the Han plots shown in Figure 3.30. All of the carbon points are within Region 2, Region 6, or along the vertical axis. There is minimal range between the 1/DIC, \u03b413C, and radiocarbon values. There is a slight trend of enriching \u03b413C, near constant radiocarbon percent modern carbon, and a decrease in dissolved inorganic carbon (an increase in 1/DIC). This trend is similar to that of the rest of the Salt Basin carbon data. Compared to the Capitan geologic province, the Salt Flats geologic province is more enriched in \u03b413C. 3.8.3 TX Salt Flats\u2013 Radiocarbon Analyses Starting in the playas to the northeast of Dell City and moving southwards through the Salt Flats, the radiocarbon activities decrease in value, which suggests older waters. Radiocarbon activities range from 13.5 to 26.1 pmC for the Salt Flats geologic province. Fontes and Garnier radiocarbon corrections also suggest an increasing age trend moving southwards (Table 3.1. 51 Figure 3.8: Overall Salt Basin carbon data plotted onto three carbon data interpre- tation graphs, created to match Han et al., 2012 [2] 52 Figure 3.9: Salt Basin measured radiocarbon activities in percent modern carbon; size of the point is dependent upon the measured activity (larger points equal larger percent modern carbon) 53 Point ID Collection \u03b413C 14C HCO3 pH CM CT Ao t Date (pmC) (mmol/L) (mmol/L) (pmC) (years) SB-0019a 4/17/2007 -10.7 24.21 5.12 7.13 2.56 5.12 71.1 8906 SB-0074a 3/5/2003 -8.6 13.49 4.8 6.15 2.4 4.8 81.87 14906 SB-0088a 4/19/2007 -9.6 16.38 4.28 7.03 2.14 4.28 66.18 11543 SB-0110a 5/16/2002 -8.7 12.09 4.78 7.01 2.39 4.78 61.3 13420 SB-0406 7/2/1986 -10.04 4.84 6.56 7.2 3.28 6.56 66.44 21654 SB-0407 6/28/1986 -10.35 4.34 5.86 7.2 2.93 5.86 68.23 22775 SB-0408 7/3/1986 -8.01 6.31 6.56 7.2 3.28 6.56 54.74 17860 SB-0409 6/28/1986 -9.65 13.98 4.64 7.2 2.32 4.64 64.2 12601 SB-0411 6/22/1986 -6.07 10.54 4.8 7.2 2.4 4.8 43.57 11731 SB-0412 6/22/1986 -6.36 5.36 5.44 7.2 2.72 5.44 45.24 17632 SB-0413 7/2/1986 -7.59 9.71 5.58 7.2 2.79 5.58 52.32 13924 SB-0414 7/1/1986 -7.54 49.5 4.92 7.2 2.41 4.92 52.04 413 SB-0415 7/14/1986 -7.58 7.6 5.08 7.2 2.54 5.08 52.27 15940 SB-0416 6/21/1986 -8.49 6.74 5.66 7.2 2.83 5.66 57.51 17723 SB-0418 6/27/1986 -4.67 11.32 4.32 7.2 2.16 4.32 35.5 9448 SB-0419 6/27/1986 -3.64 5.99 3.98 7.2 1.99 3.98 29.56 13197 SB-0449 7/1/1986 -6.8 19.64 4.75 7.2 2.38 4.75 47.77 7348 SB-0453 6/26/1986 -8.92 18.46 5.77 7.2 2.88 5.77 59.99 9743 SB-0454 6/22/1986 -8 21.02 4.9 7.2 2.45 4.9 54.69 7904 SB-0456 6/30/1986 -5.67 13.02 5.38 7.2 2.69 5.38 41.26 9535 SB-0458 7/10/1986 -6.38 16.7 4.59 7.2 2.29 4.59 45.35 8259 SB-0459a 6/21/1986 -5.78 9.56 2.92 7.2 1.46 2.92 41.89 12214 SB-0461 7/9/1986 -7.46 13.13 5.24 7.2 2.62 5.24 51.58 11310 SB-0463a 6/20/1986 -5.77 13.47 3.87 7.2 1.93 3.87 41.84 9369 SB-0475a 7/19/1986 -7.4 25.54 4.75 7.2 2.38 4.75 51.23 5754 SB-0478 7/13/1986 -5.4 35.77 3.93 7.2 .1.97 3.93 39.70 863 SB-0482 6/30/1986 -6.27 23.5 4.11 7.2 2.06 4.11 44.72 5319 SB-0483 6/30/1986 -7.99 46.52 2.90 7.2 1.45 2.90 54.63 1328 SB-0484 6/26/1986 -6.79 5.08 6.75 7.2 3.38 6.75 47.71 18517 SB-0486 7/16/1986 -7.09 10.96 6.06 7.2 3.03 6.06 49.44 12454 SB-0499a 6/30/1988 -4.36 5.97 10.24 7 5.12 10.24 36.45 14956 SB-0499b 1/26/1989 -4.4 6.6 9.9 6.7 4.95 9.9 42.62 15419 SB-0499c"

The Pi\u02dcnon Creek, Sacramento River, and Cornucopia Draw generally follow an expected increase in constituents nearer to Dell City and the playas discharge area. The exception to this trend is a plateauing ratio of one-to-one magnesium to calcium that is associated with dedolomitization (Figure 3.4). There is also a decrease in bicarbonate, constant chloride, and increasing sulfate. The increasing dominance of sulfate due to gypsum dissolution as part of dedolomitization is shown in Figure 3.3. Calcium is being released with gypsum dissolution, but reconstituted into calcite. Additional calcium and magnesium are released with dolomite dissolution. Figure 3.5 shows the dominance of magnesium instead of sodium. The bicarbonate is incorporated into the precipitated calcite and the sulfate is released from the dissolution of gypsum. The Han plots for the NM Carbonates geologic province also show the dedolomitization trend with the majority of the carbon points plotting within Region 2 and Region 6. Dedolomitization releases carbon-13 from the gypsum and dolomite minerals and incorporates heavier carbon-12 into the precipitating calcite. This process results in the trend of enriching \u03b413C, decreasing radiocarbon percent modern carbon, and a decrease in dissolved inorganic carbon (an increase in 1/DIC) shown by the red trend lines in Figure 4.2. The few points that are outside of Region 2 and Region 6 still align with the general dedolomitization trend and further suggest a mixing of groundwater sources. This mixing of sources is due to the multiple \ufb02ow paths with carbon data within the NM Carbonate geologic province. The majority of the carbon points from within this geologic province are along Pi\u02dcnon Creek, but there are a few carbon data points within Cornucopia Draw and Shiloh Draw. Sigstedt (2010) [14] concluded dedolomitization was the dominant process in New Mexico carbonates and made a radiocarbon correction speci\ufb01c to that process. Since the chemistry analyzed in this study corroborates dedolomitization as a dominant process, the correction radiocarbon ages from Sigstedt (2010) [14] are likely more accurate than the general Fontes and Garnier correction method applied in this study. The Fontes and Garnier correction method accounts for 76 isotopic exchange, but does not account of incongruent dissolution associated with dedolomitization. Isotopic exchange switches carbon-13 for carbon-12 in the minerals. The released carbon-13 will produce a slightly enriched groundwater that suggests a small initial radiocarbon activity and thus, a younger groundwater. The incongruent dissolution dissolves out carbon-13 and precipitates carbon-12, which produces a carbon-13 enriched groundwater. This enriched groundwater would suggest a higher initial radiocarbon activity that has decayed over a longer time span. Hence, incongruent dissolution would produce older groundwaters than just isotopic exchange will estimate. Consequently, the F&G corrections are likely underestimates of groundwater age and the dedolomitization correction performed by Sigstedt (2010) [14] is more reliable.

The few points that are outside of Region 2 and Region 6 still align with the general dedolomitization trend and further suggest a mixing of groundwater sources. This mixing of sources is due to the multiple \ufb02ow paths with carbon data within the NM Carbonate geologic province. The majority of the carbon points from within this geologic province are along Pi\u02dcnon Creek, but there are a few carbon data points within Cornucopia Draw and Shiloh Draw. Sigstedt (2010) [14] concluded dedolomitization was the dominant process in New Mexico carbonates and made a radiocarbon correction speci\ufb01c to that process.

Hence, incongruent dissolution would produce older groundwaters than just isotopic exchange will estimate. Consequently, the F&G corrections are likely underestimates of groundwater age and the dedolomitization correction performed by Sigstedt (2010) [14] is more reliable. The groundwaters of the Sacramento River, Pi\u02dcnon Creek, and Cornucopia Draw converge and discharge into Dell City, TX before reaching the Salt Flats. This convergence is evident in the Piper diagram of the three \ufb02ow paths\u2019 data points with a few of the northern Dell City data points (Figure 4.3). The Dell City points are constrained at the end of the dedolomitization chemical evolution pathway with a low bicarbonate, low chloride, high sulfate, and a near one-to-one ratio of magnesium to calcium. The dedolomitization evolutionary pathway is added onto Figure 4.3 as arrows. The Shiloh Draw is the last \ufb02ow path within the NM Carbonate geologic province. This \ufb02ow path is separated out due to the variability in constituents, which is likely due to the Cornudas Mountains. The Piper diagram of Shiloh Draw appears to have a loose dedolomitization trend, but has a distribution of calcium and sulfate concentrations. Figure 4.4 highlights this overall dedolomitization trend and potential mixing lines due to the Cornudas Mountains groundwater. This mixing trend line has constant bicarbonate, increasing chloride and decreasing sulfate. The Cornudas Mountains create potentiometric highs that redirect the Shiloh Draw \ufb02ow path and introduce recently recharged, silicious waters with low calcium concentrations. The igneous rocks of the Cornudas Mountains, phonolite and syenite, are ma\ufb01c silicate rocks. Consequently, dissolution of this igneous rock would contribute magnesium and silica to the Shiloh Draw groundwater. A contribution of magnesium and silica from the mountains dilutes the calcium and sulfate from dissolution of the carbonate aquifer and interbedded gypsums. This mixture of waters is dif\ufb01cult to quantify because the silicious end member resides in the Cornudas Mountains where there are no groundwater wells. This is a possible future expansion of this project. If the Cornudas Mountain silicious end member was known, then a mixing model could be applied to the Shiloh Draw data points. This would contribute to a more complete groundwater chemical analysis. 4.2 TX Cretaceous Chemistry Trends The Antelope Draw and South Well Draw begin in the southwestern Salt Basin in the Cretaceous geologic province. This area is underlaid by the coarsely 77 fractured Cretaceous limestone and rhyolite. These fractures produce a small amount of fractured \ufb02ow, but the spacing between fractures in general is too large to create a preferential \ufb02ow system. Based on this fracture network, Kreitler (1986) [54] suggested that there would be no prevalent chemical evolutionary trends. This idea is supported by the seemingly random constituents\u2019 trends of Figure 3.22a and Figure 3.23a and variable total dissolved solid concentrations. The radiocarbon ages of the Cretaceous geologic province fail to align with any given \ufb02ow path with the Fontes and Garnier radiocarbon correction and mixing correction. Older waters tend to have slightly more TDS in comparison to the younger waters. It is expected that younger waters have higher tritium concentrations due to more recent recharge. However, the tritium data of these data points has no such pattern (Figure 4.5). The carbon data points in the Antelope Draw and South Well Draw were collected in 1986 by Kreitler. This is early enough that bomb tritium from 1950\u2019s stratospheric nuclear bomb testing contributed additional radiocarbon and tritium to the groundwaters. Following this logic would explain the disconnect between radiocarbon and tritium patterns as the two peaks were not identical [77]. The point with anomalously high radiocarbon activity in Figure 4.6 is likely due to bomb pulse radiocarbon. The chemical randomness aligns with the explanation of a mixing of waters through different pathways. In one major group of \ufb02ow paths, groundwater gets trapped in the aquifer matrix blocks between fractures and chemically evolves in-place, resulting in high TDS. In an alternative \ufb02ow path group, groundwater is recharged through fractures where it quickly moves through the system without much chemical evolution, resulting in low TDS. These waters are mixed naturally as the high TDS water diffuses into the fractures, and are also mixed anthropogeni- cally as groundwater is extracted through water wells, lowering head and driving water from the matrix. This fracture mixing is unique to the Texas portion of the Salt Basin, but the tectonic fractures extend throughout the basin. Mayer (1995) [40] analyzes the role of fractures in the groundwater \ufb02ow system within the northern Salt Basin. That study concluded that the Otero Break fracture network acts as a conduit for recharge from the Sacramento Mountains to Dell City, TX. The high volume of water being transported along the Otero Break induces karsti\ufb01cation and high conductivity \ufb02ow paths [40]. This phenomenon cannot be replicated in Antelope Draw and South Well Draw due to the small volumes that recharge in this area. Both of these draws are included in the Texas-wide polygon used in the chloride- mass-balance method with PyRANA, which will be discussed in futher detail later. The estimated recharge density is not large enough to force the Antelope Draw and South Well Draw system from a fracture-matrix mixing system to a purely fracture-controlled system, as in the northern Salt Basin.

        "Text": "an alternative \ufb02ow path group, groundwater is recharged through fractures where it quickly moves through the system without much chemical evolution, resulting in low TDS. These waters are mixed naturally as the high TDS water diffuses into the fractures, and are also mixed anthropogeni- cally as groundwater is extracted through water wells, lowering head and driving water from the matrix. This fracture mixing is unique to the Texas portion of the Salt Basin, but the tectonic fractures extend throughout the basin. Mayer (1995) [40] analyzes the role of fractures in the groundwater \ufb02ow system within the northern Salt Basin. That study concluded that the Otero Break fracture network acts as a conduit for recharge from the Sacramento Mountains to Dell City, TX. The high volume of water being transported along the Otero Break induces karsti\ufb01cation and high conductivity \ufb02ow paths [40]. This phenomenon cannot be replicated in Antelope Draw and South Well Draw due to the small volumes that recharge in this area. Both of these draws are included in the Texas-wide polygon used in the chloride- mass-balance method with PyRANA, which will be discussed in futher detail later. The estimated recharge density is not large enough to force the Antelope Draw and South Well Draw system from a fracture-matrix mixing system to a purely fracture-controlled system, as in the northern Salt Basin. The two-water mixing contains additional chemical processes within the aquifer matrix. Figure 4.6 shows two additional trends on the Han plots for the Cretaceous geologic province. As shown in the NM Carbonate geologic province, the red line designates the incongruent dissolution dedolomitization trend within the Cretaceous geologic province. The carbon data points along the red trend 78 line are within Region 2 and Region 6. Dedolomitization releases carbon-13 from the gypsum and dolomite minerals and incorporates heavier carbon-12 into the precipitating calcite. This process results in the trend of enriching \u03b413C, decreasing radiocarbon percent modern carbon, and a decrease in dissolved inorganic car- bon (an increase in 1/DIC). Figure 3.4 also supports minor dedolomitization by showing a calcium-to-magnesium ratio of one-to-one. A loose dedolomitization trend, with lower calcium and magnesium concen- trations, and the calcium-to-magnesium one-to-one ratio trend are also highlighted on the W.Antelope and W.South Well Draw Piper diagram (Figure 4.7). There is a general trend towards decreasing bicarbonate, increasing chloride, constant sulfate, increasing calcium, increasing magnesium, and decreasing sodium and potassium. Due to the lack of calcium and magnesium, dedolomitization is a minor process in the Cretaceous geologic province. The second trend on the Han plots for the Cretaceous geologic province is highlighted in graph i and graph ii with the blue circle around the carbon data points (Figure 4.6). These points are along the vertical axis, which suggest a mixing of carbon sources. This mixing is more prominent in the Cretaceous geologic province carbon data in comparison to the mixing of sources within the NM Carbonate geologic province. The mixing of sources is consistent with the two-waters mixing system described to be within this province. The older waters with low radiocarbon activities tend to be enriched in \u03b413C. The younger waters with higher radiocarbon activities tend to be depleted in \u03b413C. Each water has similar dissolved inorganic carbon. These two waters mix and produce a range of \u03b413C for the constant 1/DIC. 4.3 TX Victorio Peak Chemistry Trends The Victorio Peak geologic province is to the east of the Cretaceous geologic province, but shares the same groundwater \ufb02ow paths. Therefore, the chemistry trends of the Cretaceous geologic province transition into the chemistry trends of the TX Victorio Peak geologic province. Figure 4.8 highlights the dedolomi- tization trend and mixing grouping from the Cretaceous geologic province on the combined Han plots for the Cretaceous geologic province and the Victorio Peak geologic province. Figure 3.3, Figure 3.4, and Figure 3.5 show a dominance of gypsum-derived sulfate, a one-to-one ratio of calcium-to-magnesium, and a dominance of dolomite-derived magnesium, respectively. The Victorio Peak ge- ologic province carbon data points align with these trends from the Cretaceous geologic province. Hence, dedolomitization, incongruent dissolution, and mixing of carbon sources continues into the Victorio Peak carbonate. However, the addi- tional carbonate dissolution within the Victorio Peak geologic province further enriches the groundwater in \u03b413C. Despite this enrichment from the dissolution of carbonate, gypsum, and dolomite, the precipitation of calcite removes some carbon-12 from the groundwater. Hence, the dissolved inorganic carbon remains 79 relatively constant in comparison to the Cretaceous geologic province carbon data points. The larger distribution of points within the blue mixing circles is expected as two-water mixing system from the Cretaceous mixes with groundwater affected by Victorio Peak carbonate dissolution. Since the radiocarbon corrections using the Fontes and Garnier method and mixing method in the Cretaceous geologic province failed to produce a \ufb02ow path with age trends, there is no age trend within the TX Victorio Peak geologic province. Groundwater with different ages propagated from the Cretaceous two- water mixing system into the Victorio Peak geologic province. Like the Piper diagram of the western \ufb02ow paths, Figure 4.9 shows a loose dedolomitization trend continuing into the Victorio Peak geologic province from the Cretaceous. The one-to-one ratio of calcium-to-magnesium is also continued and designated with a trend line on the Piper diagram. Due to the overall lack of calcium and magnesium, dedolomitization is a minor process in the Victorio Peak geologic province. The transition from geologic provinces has an overall lower bicarbonate, higher chloride, higher sulfate, lower calcium, lower magnesium, and higher sodium and potassium. This trend could be explained with additional precipitation of calcite removing more bicarbonate and calcium, more dissolution of gypsum contributing more sulfate, and less dissolution of dolomite contributing bicarbonate, calcium, and magnesium. The chloride and sodium are likely due to halite dissolution and/or mixing with Salt Flat brines along the eastern margin of the Victorio Peak geologic province. 4.4 TX Capitan Reef Chemistry Trends Along the eastern margin of the Salt Basin, the Capitan geologic province and corresponding \ufb02ow path is a limestone system that is juxtaposed with the Salt Flats to the west. The location of the carbon points on the Capitan geologic province Han plots are in Region 2 and Region 6. These regions are associated with dedolomitization. Figure 3.3, Figure 3.4, and Figure 3.5 show a dominance of gypsum-derived sulfate, a one-to-one ratio of calcium-to-magnesium, and a dominance of dolomite-derived magnesium, respectively. Since the carbon points tend to be closer to the vertical axis on graph i and graph ii, it is likely that this dedolomitization trend is also representative of a mixing of carbon sources in the Capitan geologic province. Figure 4.10 highlights the general dedolomitization and mixing trend on the Han plots. The mixing of carbon sources is likely due to groundwaters originating in the Guadalupe Mountains/Brokeoff Mountains and \ufb02owing through either the Big Dog Canyon or Capitan \ufb02ow paths. There is not a singular headwater for the Capitan \ufb02ow path through the Capitan geologic province. The four carbon data points within the Capitan geologic province have cor- rected radiocarbon ages. These ages were found using the Fontes and Garnier method to corrected for isotopic exchange. The corrected radiocarbon ages follow 80 an expected trend of increasing age further southwards."

The location of the carbon points on the Capitan geologic province Han plots are in Region 2 and Region 6. These regions are associated with dedolomitization. Figure 3.3, Figure 3.4, and Figure 3.5 show a dominance of gypsum-derived sulfate, a one-to-one ratio of calcium-to-magnesium, and a dominance of dolomite-derived magnesium, respectively. Since the carbon points tend to be closer to the vertical axis on graph i and graph ii, it is likely that this dedolomitization trend is also representative of a mixing of carbon sources in the Capitan geologic province. Figure 4.10 highlights the general dedolomitization and mixing trend on the Han plots. The mixing of carbon sources is likely due to groundwaters originating in the Guadalupe Mountains/Brokeoff Mountains and \ufb02owing through either the Big Dog Canyon or Capitan \ufb02ow paths. There is not a singular headwater for the Capitan \ufb02ow path through the Capitan geologic province. The four carbon data points within the Capitan geologic province have cor- rected radiocarbon ages. These ages were found using the Fontes and Garnier method to corrected for isotopic exchange. The corrected radiocarbon ages follow 80 an expected trend of increasing age further southwards. It is expected that once a groundwater becomes isolated from the atmosphere, the radiocarbon will decay at a constant rate. Further down the \ufb02ow path, there should be less radiocarbon to coincide with an older groundwater age. Despite the range of constituents in the Capitan geologic province, there is a slight dedolomitization trend with lower-than-expected calcium and magne- sium (Figure 4.11). There is a general trend towards decreasing bicarbonate with increasing chloride and constant sulfate. The calcium-to-magnesium ratio is a one-to-one ratio, as expected for dedolomitization. Due to the lack of calcium and magnesium, dedolomitization is a minor process in the Capitan geologic province. Like the Victorio Peak geologic province, there is a trend of increased chloride with increased sodium and potassium. This is likely due to halite dissolution and/or brine mixing from the Salt Flats along the western and southern margin of the Capitan geologic province. 4.5 NM Artesia Group Chemistry Trends The Big Dog Canyon within the Artesia Group geologic province has two representative points, thus making chemical evolutionary trends dif\ufb01cult to for- mulate. Due to the chemistry context of the rest of the Salt Basin and based on the location of the two data points on the Piper diagram, it is likely that there is dedolomitization occurring in the Artesia Group geologic province (Figure 4.12). Figure 3.3 supports the dedolomitization trend as it shows an increasing domi- nance of sulfate. However, it is possible that these two points do not represent dedolomitization along a \ufb02ow path and rather represent gypsum dissolution within the Big Dog Canyon \ufb02ow path. This would explain the decrease in bicar- bonate, decrease in chloride, increase in sulfate, increase in calcium, decrease in magnesium, and no change in sodium and potassium. Figure 3.4 support this gypsum dissolution as it shows a dominance of calcium, rather than a one-to- one ratio of calcium-to-magnesium. Further, Figure 3.5 shows a dominance of sodium, which suggests a minimal amount of magnesium. This small concentra- tion of magnesium is counter to the expected dedolomitization trend. Nonetheless, conclusions drawn from two data points have minimal certainty. 4.6 Dell City, TX Chemistry Trends Dell City, Texas is located adjacent to the discharge area of the northern Salt Basin, and thus has a similar chemistry as Pi\u02dcnon Creek, Cornucopia Draw, and Sacramento River. As shown previously in Figure 4.3, the Dell City groundwaters are at the end of the dedolomitization trend associated with the end of the Pi\u02dcnon Creek, Cornucopia Draw, and Sacramento River \ufb02ow paths. Figure 3.4 supports this end-of-dedolomitization trend with a calcium-to-magnesium ratio within Dell City of one-to-one. 81 Within Dell City, there is an increase in chloride with a decrease in sulfate as the groundwater moves southwards towards the Salt Flats (Figure 3.3). This trend is consistent with active irrigation and evapotranspiration in Dell City concentrating the chloride through irrigation return \ufb02ow and a mixing with saline waters from the Salt Flats. This same brine mixing trend was highlighted in the Victorio Peak and Capitan geologic provinces. Figure 3.5 shows a shift from magnesium-dominated groundwaters, due to dedolomitization in the NM Carbonates geologic province, into sodium-dominated groundwaters, due to ET and Salt Flats brine mixing. The Piper diagram of Dell City (Figure 3.28a) is dominated by chloride and sulfate with a range of cations. Sodium and potassium are the most dominant cation, followed by calcium, and then magnesium. 4.7 TX Salt Flats Chemistry Trends The Salt Flats are the culmination of all of the \ufb02ow paths throughout the Salt Basin. Hence, the chemistry of the Salt Flats should appear similar to the chemistry of all of the other geologic provinces. Figure 4.13 shows the Salt Flats\u2019 carbon data with respect to all of the Salt Basin carbon data grayed out behind it. The Salt Flats points are amongst the other carbon points from the rest of the Salt Basin within Region 2 and Region 6. For the Salt Flats, there is a dedolomitization trend that continues from the carbonate aquifers. Figure 3.4 has the continued one-to-one ratio of calcium-to-magnesium. Dedolomitization releases carbon- 13 from the gypsum and dolomite minerals and incorporates heavier carbon- 12 into the precipitating calcite. This process results in the trend of enriching \u03b413C, decreasing radiocarbon percent modern carbon, and a decrease in dissolved inorganic carbon (an increase in 1/DIC). There is a range of dissolved inorganic carbon concentrations due to the convergence of multiple groundwater sources into the Salt Flats. The highlighted carbon data best align with the diamond points in Figure 4.13. These symbols designate carbon data from the NM Carbonate geologic province. The dominance of the NM Carbonate geologic province in the cumulative chemistry of the Salt Flats suggests that the \ufb02ow paths through the NM Carbonate geologic province carry the largest volume of groundwater. These \ufb02ow paths would be the Pi\u02dcnon Creek, Cornucopia Draw, Sacramento River, and Shiloh Draw. Due to the active agriculture and irrigation of the Dell City area, the radio- carbon system is not fully closed within the playas to the northeast of Dell City. Instead, the groundwater is partially aerated and radiocarbon is reintroduced into the groundwater through irrigation return \ufb02ow. Because of this process, the radiocarbon activities with the northern Salt Flats correspond to relatively young groundwater ages (Figure 3.9). High activities of radiocarbon in the system that has not decayed suggests an overall younger water that was recently recharged into the groundwater system and"

Instead, the groundwater is partially aerated and radiocarbon is reintroduced into the groundwater through irrigation return \ufb02ow. Because of this process, the radiocarbon activities with the northern Salt Flats correspond to relatively young groundwater ages (Figure 3.9). High activities of radiocarbon in the system that has not decayed suggests an overall younger water that was recently recharged into the groundwater system and isolated from the atmosphere. Starting with this young water in the north, the southern Salt Flats have older waters that have decayed over the length of the \ufb02ow path. The seemingly anomalous younger 82 radiocarbon age in the southern Salt Flats may be due to mixing of younger waters from the Cretaceous and Victorio Peak geologic provinces. As expected, the chemistry of the Salt Flats re\ufb02ects the combination of the other \ufb02ow paths through different geologic provinces (Figure 4.14). The Piper diagram of the Salt Flats shows the same calcium-to-magnesium one-to-one ratio seen throughout the Salt Basin. The anions of the Salt Flats have a slight trend of increasing chloride with decreasing bicarbonate and decreasing sulfate. Figure 3.3 also shows this dominance of chloride with respect to sulfate. This trend is consistent with the production of evaporites such as gypsum and dolomite on the playa surface. The salts are carried upwards to the surface from the groundwater via capillary rise. Once near the surface, the water is evaporated away and leaves behind the salts. Due to the high concentrations of chloride and sodium in the Salt Flats groundwater, it is likely that halite is not a common evaporite on the playa surface. Instead, the chloride and sodium remain in solution as a brine. Figure 3.5 shows the dominance of sodium with respect to magnesium in the Salt Flats. This brine extends outwards from the Salt Flats and mixes with groundwater in the Victorio Peak, Capitan, and Dell City geologic provinces. 83 (a) Figure 4.1a Comparison between Pi\u02dcnon Creek Piper diagram from this study (also in Figure 3.11a) and from Sigstedt (2010) [14]; right: linear trend indicating increasing magnesium and sulfate concentrations indicative of dedolomitization [14] 84 Figure 4.2: NM Carbonates carbon data plotted onto three carbon data interpreta- tion graphs, to match Han et al., 2012 [2]; red trend lines designate dedolomitzation trend 85 Figure 4.3: Piper diagram of chemistry points from Pi\u02dcnon Creek, Cornucopia Draw, Sacramento River, and northern Dell City,TX, as denoted by color; size of the point is scaled by TDS concentration; arrows show direction of dedolomitization trend as described in Back (1983) [75] 86 Figure 4.4: Piper diagram of chemistry points from Shiloh Draw (also in Fig- ure 3.14a); size of the point is scaled by TDS concentration; arrow is indicative of dedolomitization; red lines suggest mixing with silicious waters from the Cor- nudas Mountains 87 Figure 4.5: Tritium concentrations with respect to Fontes and Garnier corrected radiocarbon ages for Cretaceous geologic province; tritium in Tritium Units (TU); R value and equation for linear trend line of tritium points provided 88 Figure 4.6: TX Cretaceous carbon data plotted onto three carbon data interpretation graphs, to match Han et al., 2012 [2]; red trend lines designate dedolomitzation trend; blue circles designate mixing of carbon sources 89 Figure 4.7: Piper diagram of chemistry points from Cretaceous; size of the point is scaled by TDS concentration; arrow is indicative of dedolomitization; red lines suggest mixing with Salt Flats brine 90 Figure 4.8: TX Victorio Peak carbon data plotted onto three carbon data interpreta- tion graphs, to match Han et al., 2012 [2]; red trend lines designate dedolomitzation trend; blue circles designate mixing of carbon sources 91 Figure 4.9: Piper diagram of chemistry points from Victorio Peak; size of the point is scaled by TDS concentration; arrow is indicative of dedolomitization; red lines suggest mixing with Salt Flats brine 92 Figure 4.10: TX Capitan Reef carbon data plotted onto three carbon data interpreta- tion graphs, to match Han et al., 2012 [2]; red trend lines designate dedolomitzation trend; blue circles designate mixing of carbon sources 93 Figure 4.11: Piper diagram of chemistry points from Capitan Reef; size of the point is scaled by TDS concentration; arrow is indicative of dedolomitization; red lines suggest mixing with Salt Flats brine 94 Figure 4.12: Piper diagram of chemistry points from Artesia Group; size of the point is scaled by TDS concentration; arrow is indicative of dedolomitization 95 Figure 4.13: TX Salt Flats carbon data plotted onto three carbon data interpretation graphs, to match Han et al., 2012 [2]; red circles = Salt Flats, gray diamonds = Carbonates, gray circles = Cretaceous, gray triangles = Victorio Peak, gray squares = Capitan 96 Figure 4.14: Piper diagram of chemistry points from Salt Flats; size of the point is scaled by TDS concentration; trend lines are indicative of mixing with halite from the playa surface 97 CHAPTER 5 WATER-BUDGET METHODS 5.1 NDVI Agricultural Evapotranspiration Google Earth Engine (GEE) is a cloud-based platform that provides access geospatial databases and simpli\ufb01es geospatial analyses using high-performance parallel computing [78].

This active agricultural area can be identi\ufb01ed from a normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) map, where it contrasts strongly with the rest of the relatively barren Salt Basin. The data catalog connected to GEE contains image collections from Landsat missions, dating back to 1972 [79]. Within the Landsat data catalog, the \u201cTier 1, 8-day NDVI composite\u201d images from Landsat 5, 7, and 8 were colorized and used to visualize the NDVI for the Salt Basin over 35 years from 1984 to 2019. The beginning of the date range was established to align with the launch of Landsat 5 in March 1984 [80]. Landsat 5 data was utilized for analyses prior to 2012, when the satellite was nearing the end of its mission that of\ufb01cially terminated in January 2013. Landsat 7 was used to supplement Landsat 5 for 2012. However, Landsat 7 experienced a Scan Line Corrector (SLC) failure on May 31st, 2003 [81]. Hence, geospatial data from Landsat 7 was only used for 2012 before Landsat 8 was launched in February 2013. The remaining years from 2013 to 2019 used Landsat 8 data. The image collections from Landsat 5, 7, and 8 were \ufb01ltered to a speci\ufb01c date range from June 1st to August 31st of each year. This date range was selected as the \u201cpeak growing season\u201d for agriculture within the Salt Basin based on visual inspection of monthly NDVI data (Figure 5.1, Figure 5.2, Figure 5.3) and the time between characteristic planting and harvesting dates for cotton and alfalfa in New Mexico [44]. These two crops are the most common agricultural product of Dell City [41, 44]. This date range is not fully representative of the full growing season of March to October, but rather represents the peak season from June to August 98 where it was assumed that agricultural greenness is maximized. Hence, Landsat images collected during this time range were \ufb01ltered for the 85th percentile NDVI value to produce a singular active agricultural area for each year. This statistical approach reduced the noise from transient events, such as harvesting, cloudiness, or poor image quality, while maintaining the ability to detect differences between well-watered crops and weeds, desert vegetation, or poorly irrigated areas with little to no vegetation. Figure 5.1: Monthly Google Earth Engine images of active agricultural greenness in the Dell City irrigation district and surrounding areas of the Salt Basin to show increase in greenness from March to October, with the peak greenness occurring between June and August; images are from 2017, which is considered a \u2018wet\u2019 year due to the large aerial extent of greenness; image data from Landsat 5, 7, and 8 and extracted using Appendix B.1 code The NDVI image collection was reduced to show the top 85th percentile NDVI value at each pixel. If the pixel value exceeded a threshold that we set to 0.5, then 99 it was considered to be within the agricultural areas of the Salt Basin. Justi\ufb01cation of this 85th percentile compared the resulting annual average active agricultural area to the active agricultural area values calculated by Groeneveld and Baugh (2002) [43]. Percentile values of 75 and 90 shifted the total area of active irrigation down or up, respectively, without changing the relative temporal pattern of the time series of annual irrigation acreage. The threshold of 0.5 was chosen to be equal to the NDVI of a manually selected green cell within the Salt Basin domain that was identi\ufb01ed to be an active agricultural \ufb01eld with low-to-average greenness (Figure 5.4). Any greenness below this threshold was not included in the total annual active greenness. Below the percentile and threshold limit, greenness of the landscape could be attributed to natural \ufb02ora that surround the agricultural \ufb01elds, but use no irrigation. The only areas that were utilized for this geospatial analysis had visually identi\ufb01ed active agriculture, such as pivot circles and unnatural, man-made rectangles of green. This reduced the possibility of including native \ufb02ora greenness in the agricultural greenness calculations. This process of reducing the NDVI Landsat 5, 7, and 8 image collections to a speci\ufb01c growing season date range, using a speci\ufb01c percentile to include, and over speci\ufb01ed agricultural area produces an \u201cactive ag cells\u201d JSON for each year in hectares. Refer to Appendix B.1 for an example year\u2019s code to perform these re\ufb01nements and produce an area where agriculture was likely being actively irrigated due to the level of NDVI greenness. In order to create an outline of whatever Google Earth Engine counted as an active agricultural cell, there is an additional piece of code that exports an image of the counted cells\u2019 outline to the Google Drive. This outlining was used to visualize the active cells throughout the Dell City agricultural district, so it was only done every 4-6 years (1985, 1991, 1995, 2000, 2005, 2010, 2015, and 2019). Once Google Earth Engine produced an area where there was active agricul- ture and thus active irrigation, the Blaney-Criddle method was used to calculate a reference crop evapotranspiration (ETo) and then an effective irrigation pumping rate. This method was chosen because it is commonly used by New Mexico Of\ufb01ce of the State Engineer (NMOSE) to estimate evapotranspiration [82]. The Blaney- Criddle is a theoretical method that requires a minimum and maximum monthly average temperature in Celsius. The equation for this method is given as ETo = p(0.46Tmean + 8) (5.1) with the reference crop evapotranspiration (ETo) being a function of mean daily percentage of annual daytime hours (p) and the mean daily temperature (Tmean) in Celsius.

The atmospheric water vapor pressure de\ufb01cit, which is in\ufb02uenced by air temperature, in\ufb02uences a crop to shrink or expand its stomata in order to regulate internal water vapor. An increase in temperature results in stomatal closure to limit the amount of water the plant can lose to the atmosphere due to transpiration [83]. Further, a warmer air temperature will likely evaporate more water from the soil surface. 100 Within the Blaney-Criddle equation, there is also an estimated p-value from Table 5.1 [82]. This p-value represents the mean daily percentage of annual daytime hours for a given latitude during a given month. Sunlight throughout the day often correlates to warmer air temperatures and thus, an increase in evapotranspiration potential. Since the majority of the agricultural \ufb01elds in the Salt Basin are located around Dell City, TX, the latitude of Dell City was used to choose monthly p-values for March through October (Latitude of 31.9387\u00b0N = p-value of 0.32, 0.31, 0.3, etc. 5.1). Together, the method estimates how much water is theoretically being lost to the atmosphere through evapotranspiration from the reference crop of grass/alfalfa and the surrounding soil based on the average temperature and amount of sunlight. This resulting reference ETo is produced monthly, but was averaged over the eight months between March 1st and October 31st that are considered to be representative of the peak growing season.

The reference crop evapotranspiration rate was applied to the annual active agricultural surface area de\ufb01ned from GEE to estimate a volumetric rate of water leaving the system due to ET. That volumetric rate of ET was lastly multiplied by the number days in the growing season [March 1 to October 31 = 245 days] to produce a result of annual average volume evapotranspired in acre-feet per year during the months of March to October. 101 5.2 Chloride-Mass-Balance Approach It is possible to create a groundwater recharge estimate based on chloride and bromide concentrations using the chloride-mass-balance method. Because chloride is non-reactive and stays in solution, chloride concentrations increase linearly as water is evaporated from a solution. Given an initial and \ufb01nal concentration, the fraction of water evaporated from the system (or alternative, the fraction of water remaining) can be calculated. With a large hydrochemical database, this method was useful to estimate an independent groundwater recharge rate for the Salt Basin. This method differentiates atmospheric chloride and chloride from mineral dissolution within the aquifer by effectively making a mixing model between a deep basin brine and fresh precipitation. Atmospheric chloride is deposited on the surface as wet deposition within precipitation and as dry deposition within dust [84]. The atmospheric deposition rate is dependent upon the atmospheric conditions, and consequently it varied from the Pleistocene to Holocene [85]. For the Holocene (less than 12,000 years ago), the steady-state atmospheric chloride deposition \ufb02ux in precipitation in the study area is 0.55 mg/L [22]. The following chloride-mass-balance with bromide-correction methodology was modi\ufb01ed from Rawling and Newton (2016) [22]. The bromide correction fac- tor was utilized to mitigate the in\ufb02uence of chloride in the system due to mineral dissolution. Geologic chloride is associated with higher bromide concentrations than atmospheric chloride. The chloride mixing model creates a curve between two end members with corresponding chloride and bromide concentrations; one end member was freshwater/precipitation and the other end member was chlo- ride brine. The freshwater end member has chloride concentrations of 0.55 mg/L, as determined by Rawling and Newton (2016) [22]. This was the lowest value of chloride that could be used to produce a usable curve with the Salt Basin data. Bromide concentration for the freshwater is 0.00846 mg/L. This value was cal- culated using the lowest Cl/Br ratio of 65 groundwater samples that was found within the Sacramento Mountains [22]. An unpublished report, referenced in Rawling and Newton (2016) [22] as \u201cStreet and Peery, 2007\u201d, found a brine in Cloudcroft, NM with very high chloride (130,000 mg/L) and bromide below"

This value was cal- culated using the lowest Cl/Br ratio of 65 groundwater samples that was found within the Sacramento Mountains [22]. An unpublished report, referenced in Rawling and Newton (2016) [22] as \u201cStreet and Peery, 2007\u201d, found a brine in Cloudcroft, NM with very high chloride (130,000 mg/L) and bromide below the detection limit. The resulting chloride-to-bromide ratio would be higher than 1,000 (mg/L)/(mg/L). Though Cloudcroft, NM is not within the Salt Basin domain, it is within the Yeso formation within the Sacramento Mountains. These charac- teristics overlap into the Salt Basin. Hence, the Cloudcroft brine is considered representative of deep basin brines within the Yeso formation and within the Salt Basin. For the brine end member, the speci\ufb01c values were less important. Rather than having the measured brine as the end member, the chloride concentration was set to 10,000 mg/L, the Cl/Br ratio was set to be 9,000, and thus the bromide concentration was set to 1.1 mg/L [22]. Clmodel = [F \u22120.00001](Cl f reshwater) + (1 \u2212[F \u22120.00001])(Clbrine) (5.2) with a 0.00001 decrease with each consecutive proportion and \u2018F\u2019 equal to the prior result of the bracketed amount starting with F=1. This bracketed amount 102 represents the incremental decrease in the fraction of fresh water with respect to an equal increase in fraction of brine. The modeled concentrations of chloride and bromide use freshwater and brine concentrations of chloride and bromide. Figure 5.5 shows that resulting chloride-mass-balance mixing curve. For the Salt Basin data, the chloride-to-bromide ratios were calculated and compared against the mixing curve to \ufb01nd the most likely chloride concentration from the modeled mixing between the freshwater and brine. This \u2018most likely\u2019 chloride concentration is designated as the \u2018mixed\u2019 chloride concentration and is representative of the total chloride concentration due to a modeled mixture of precipitation and brine that produces the measured chloride-to-bromide ratio. Consequently, the mixed chloride concentration includes the mixing ratio between fresh precipitation and brine waters. From this mixture chloride concentration, the corrected amount of atmospheric chloride was calculated using the following equation: Clcorrected = Clmeasured Clbrine \u00d7 0.55mg/L (5.3) , where the 0.55 mg/L is the steady-state atmospheric chloride deposition \ufb02ux in precipitation in the study area [22]. The corrected chloride concentration re\ufb02ects the amount of atmospheric chloride in the groundwater sample with respect to the appropriate mixing ratio between fresh precipitation and brine water. All of this atmospheric chloride was deposited at the steady-state depositional rate and recharged to the groundwater with precipitation. Hence, the recharge amount as a fraction of total precipitation is equal to the steady-state depositional \ufb02ux divided by the corrected chloride concentration. To ultimately get a recharge rate for the entire Salt Basin to compare to historic values, this fraction recharge amount was multiplied by total precipitation rates. The overall equation for the resulting recharge fraction from the chloride-mass-balance method is as follows: Recharge fraction = 0.55mg/L ( Clmeasured Clmixed ) \u00d7 0.55mg/L (5.4) Rather than applying a singular average corrected recharge rate to the entire Salt Basin, recharge polygons were delineated using the HUC 10-digit watersheds and the spatial distribution of the corrected recharge rates. This separation resulted in two types of polygons: high, mountainous polygons and lowland polygons. The mountainous polygons used the total precipitation rate as potential recharge, altered by vegetation interception. This interception amount was applied only to the mountainous polygons and used code from Appendix B.1, which will be explained in further detail later. Simply, the code calculated a ratio of highly vegetated area versus total polygon area. This ratio became the interception ratio and was multiplied by the total precipitation to get a total precipitation amount reaching the surface. The precipitation amount that reached the surface was then multiplied by the fraction recharge to estimate total recharge rate for the mountainous polygons. For the lowland polygons, the total precipitation rate 103 was not useful, due to the semiarid nature of the Salt Basin. Therefore, the runoff values for each lowland polygon were calculated by PyRANA, which will be explained in further detail later. The runoff rates were multiplied by the fraction recharge rate to estimate total recharge rates for the lowland polygons. The total recharge rate from the chloride-mass-balance method is the sum of the recharge rates from each polygon. 5.3 Python Recharge Assessment for New Mexico Aquifers (PyRANA) Groundwater recharge estimation independent from chemistry uses Python Recharge Assessment for New Mexico Aquifers (PyRANA). Originally called the Evapotranspiration and Recharge Model (ETRM), this distributed-parameter soil-water-balance model was developed at New Mexico Tech in 2016 by David Ketchum, Peter ReVelle, Esther Xu, Jake Ross, and Talon Newton [26\u201328, 86]. PyRANA quanti\ufb01es recharge separately as diffuse recharge and focused recharge. Diffuse recharge is precipitation that in\ufb01ltrates where it meets the ground surface and becomes recharge. In our study area, this diffuse recharge is found within high elevation areas, associated with the Ponderosa pine forests of the high Sacramento Mountains and Guadalupe Mountains. Focused recharge is the result of overland \ufb02ow concentrating runoff into ephemeral channels in the lowlands, where it can then in\ufb01ltrate through the channel bed or into a terminal playa. In both cases, water must in\ufb01ltrate below the effective rooting depth of the surface vegetation, or the wicking depth of evaporation in bare ground, in order to be considered recharge. This fraction of runoff that becomes recharge is a modi\ufb01er that is multiplied to the PyRANA results at the end. PyRANA estimates evapotranspiration, runoff, and thus recharge based on multiple input parameters. For these calculations, PyRANA requires surface elevation/digital elevation model (DEM), Parameter-elevation on Independent Slopes Model (PRISM) precipitation, climate data, Gridded Atmospheric Data Downscaling Evapotranspiration Tools (GADGET), vegetation coverage/ normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) from Moderate Resolution Imag- ing Spectroradiometer (MODIS),"

For these calculations, PyRANA requires surface elevation/digital elevation model (DEM), Parameter-elevation on Independent Slopes Model (PRISM) precipitation, climate data, Gridded Atmospheric Data Downscaling Evapotranspiration Tools (GADGET), vegetation coverage/ normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) from Moderate Resolution Imag- ing Spectroradiometer (MODIS), soil characteristics from Natural Resources Con- servation Service (NRCS), rooting depth, and root capture ef\ufb01ciency, as well as additional parameters de\ufb01ned in Ketchum (2016) [26]. The rooting depth and root capture ef\ufb01ciency are set based on the type of vegetation and characteristic soil thickness within the diffuse recharge areas. The vegetation cover within the Salt Basin was divided into 9 categories with corresponding rooting depths: 1) bare, 2) shrub, 3) grasses, 4) Pi\u02dcnon-Juniper, 5) Ponderosa pine and mixed conifer, 6) mountain grasses/meadow, 7) Riparian wetlands, 8) prairie, 9) Creosote. Within these variables, PyRANA applies modi\ufb01cation factors that limit winter evaporation and corrects for monsoonal precipitation [26\u201328, 86]. A water stress coef\ufb01cient comes from Allen et al.(2011) [87]. In order to calculate evapotranspiration from the input parameters, PyRANA utilizes a modi\ufb01ed version of Food and Agriculture Organization\u2019s 104 (FAO) Penman-Monteith equation from Allen et al. (2011) [26\u201328, 86, 87]. This methodology uses a dual crop coef\ufb01cient, soil-water-balance, and energy balance in order to quantify the net effect of the input variables and ascertain the amount of recharge in the system. As a qualitative output, PyRANA produces spatial distribution maps of vegetation, diffuse recharge areas, and channels of probable focused recharge. Runoff in the Salt Basin is calculated by PyRANA using a non- linear regression relationship established by Xu (2018) [27]. This relationship is between daily precipitation rates and runoff measured in Walnut Gulch, Arizona. For every intensity of precipitation, there is a different amount of runoff estimated that changes non-linearly. Walnut Gulch has comparable climate and vegetation to the Salt Basin and is well monitored [27]. With the similar climate, Walnut Gulch also experiences monsoons. Hence, the monsoonal season has a different regression than that for the winter months. As denoted by the name, PyRANA was developed for New Mexico aquifers. The original inputs for PyRANA were limited to New Mexico. Because the model physics of PyRANA are universal, the model outputs were extended southwards to cover the Texas portion of the Salt Basin using a linear regression using the low- lands of the New Mexico Salt Basin as a reference. Using R statistical software [88], the PRISM gridded annual average precipitation produce and elevation data from the USGS were used as predictors from the PyRANA derived average annual runoff gridded output. Once the model was \ufb01t using runoff estimates from New Mexico, an annual runoff grid for the Texas portion of the basin was produced. Diffuse recharge was not well predicted by PRISM precipitation and elevation, so no regression estimate of diffuse recharge was produced for Texas. However, given that diffuse recharge was only predicted by PyRANA in the Ponderosa pine portion of the northern Salt Basin, we are con\ufb01dent that the model would not have predicted any diffuse recharge in the creosote and grass dominated southern portion of the basin. The input datasets for PyRANA have not been processed for the Texas portion of the study area, so model outputs are limited to the New Mexico side. Within areas of the New Mexico Salt Basin where laterally \ufb02owing groundwater serves as an additional source of soil moisture (i.e., salt playas), PyRANA has dif\ufb01culty estimating the amount of evaporation for the surface be- cause it is a one-dimensional (i.e., vertical) model. PyRANA input data have only been processes for the period January 1, 2000 to December 31, 2013, limiting results reported here to an average of the years 2002-2013. The \ufb01rst two years, 2000-2001, are considered unreliable due to the need to spin up the model to balance soil moisture storage values. PyRANA has further potential for uncertainty since runoff is estimated based on a precipitation intensity and duration regression calibrated using data from Walnut Gulch, AZ [27, 28]. 105 Figure 5.2: Monthly Google Earth Engine images of active agricultural greenness in the Dell City irrigation district and surrounding areas of the Salt Basin to show increase in greenness from March to October, with the peak greenness occurring between June and August; images are from 2011, which is considered an \u2018intermediate\u2019 year due to the average aerial extent of greenness; image data from Landsat 5, 7, and 8 and extracted using Appendix B.1 code; December data is omitted due to poor image quality 106 Figure 5.3: Monthly Google Earth Engine images of active agricultural greenness in the Dell City irrigation district and surrounding areas of the Salt Basin to show increase in greenness from March to October, with the peak greenness occurring between June and August; images are from 2019, which is considered a \u2018dry\u2019 year due to the small aerial extent of greenness; image data from Landsat 5, 7, and 8 and extracted using Appendix B.1 code 107 Figure 5.4: Google Earth Engine average active agricultural greenness threshold set to 0.5, based on greenness of highlighted cell within Dell City irrigation dis- trict; image from 2016; image data from Landsat 5, 7, and 8 and extracted using Appendix B.1 code 108 Figure 5.5: Modeled chloride mixing curve showing ratio of chloride to bromide versus concentration of chloride, made using chloride-mass-balance mixing equa- tion and explanation from [22] 109 CHAPTER 6 WATER-BUDGET RESULTS 6.1 Blaney-Criddle Consumptive Use Using daily temperature maximum and minimum for Dell City, TX, the average maximum and minimum were calculated, and from those values, the mean temperature for each month was calculated (Appendix C.1).

Using the Blaney-Criddle approach equation and the respective p value for each month from Table 5.1, the monthly reference evapotranspiration values were calculated. Google Earth Engine was used to de\ufb01ne annual active agricultural cells throughout the Salt Basin. Figure 6.1 shows an example of this active agricultural aerial extent that contributes water lose due to evapotranspiration, as speci\ufb01ed by Google Earth Engine and speci\ufb01ed greenness thresholds. The result of this analysis was an annual consumptive use rate of water for the irrigation district with active agriculture around Dell City, TX. Table 6.1 has these \ufb01nal consumptive use measurements, using values provided in Appendix C.1. The maximum annual consumptive use for Dell City was 95,758 acre-feet per year in 2014. The minimum annual consumptive use was 26,722 acre-feet per year in 1990. There is a general temporal trend of increasing consumptive use nearing modern, as shown in Figure 6.2. 6.2 Chloride-Mass-Balance The chloride-mass-balance method used 139 groundwater well samples that contained chloride and bromide. Figure 6.3 presents the Salt Basin data points with respect to the chloride mixing model curve. Since the measured points are under the curve, the mixing model is applicable to the Salt Basin. Figure 6.4 shows the spatial distribution of the samples, as well as the corrected chloride recharge fractions. Plotting the corrected against the uncorrected recharge fractions for each polygon, it is evident that the chloride-mass-balance corrections affect the waters that originated from the Sacramento Mountains the most: Pi\u02dcnon Creek, Sacramento River, and Sacramento Mountains (Figure 6.5). These polygons with Sacramento Mountain groundwater change a maximum of 0.3 (30%), moving from 0.07 (7%) to 0.37 (37%). The remainder of the Salt Basin chloride points change a maximum of 0.07 (7%), moving from 0.01 (1%) to 0.08 (8%). Additionally, assuming 110 Figure 6.1: Aerial extent of active agricultural greenness from Google Earth Engine for 2019 is highlighted in white; black background designates area where there was potential for agricultural greenness the majority of recharge occurs in the Sacramento Mountains, the chloride mixing curve corrections are justi\ufb01ed for the Salt Basin chloride data points. Using this distribution, the Salt Basin was separated into 8 recharge polygons. The polygons were primarily based on the HUC 10-digit watersheds of the Salt Basin, and were modi\ufb01ed to group similar initial recharge values, as well as grouping watersheds within the same general groundwater \ufb02ow path according to observed hydraulic head (Figure 1.8). Two additional polygons were established to align with mountainous diffuse recharge areas from PyRANA, which will be discussed in further detail later. An average corrected recharge fraction over the aerial extent of each polygon was then calculated. This average corrected recharge value represents the proportion of average precipitation that becomes recharge 111 Figure 6.2: Annual Consumptive Use from Blaney-Criddle for Dell City irrigation district; consumptive use in acre-feet per year; data from Table 6.1; equation and R squared value for trend line provided and was calculated by averaging all of the corrected recharge values within each polygon (Table 6.2). For the polygons around the Sacramento Mountains and Guadalupe Mountains, all of the annual precipitation was considered as the source water for potential recharge. For the other 6 polygons spread throughout the lowlands of the Salt Basin, only the runoff amount from PyRANA was considered as the potential recharge source. This stipulation was added to re\ufb02ect the semiarid nature of the lowland basin where the majority of precipitation was evaporated or transpired from the soil, leaving an accumulation of chloride in the root zone. Our conceptual model of these areas only includes focused recharge along ephemeral channels, so the source water that should be considered was only the runoff that accumulates there in \ufb02ow events. Focused recharge in the lowlands creates an irregular pattern in the groundwater isotopes by mixing locally-sourced water with water that followed a longer \ufb02ow path from the headwaters. Since Figure 3.7 shows this irregular pattern of \u03b418O, there is likely focused recharge occurring in the lowlands. Table 6.2 provides the areas, runoff amount (or total precipitation for mountain polygons), average corrected recharge, and recharge volume for the recharge polygons shown in Figure 6.4. For the lowland polygons, the corrected recharge rates from the chloride-mass- balance method ranged from 169 acre-feet per year (for Shiloh Draw) to 2,338 acre-feet per year (for Pi\u02dcnon Creek). These recharge amounts were overshadowed 112 Figure 6.3: Salt Basin chloride and bromide data points against modeled chlo- ride mixing curve showing ratio of chloride to bromide versus concentration of chloride, made using the chloride-mass-balance mixing equation and explanation from [22]; data concentrations from Appendix A.1 by the recharge rates from the Sacramento Mountains of 22,078 acre-feet per year and the Guadalupe Mountains of 4,628 acre-feet per year. The cumulative recharge rate for the chloride-mass-balance method is 31,562 acre-feet per year. 6.3 PyRANA Runoff Recharge PyRANA calculates the diffused and focused recharge separately, due to the differences in the processes. Diffuse recharge in the Salt Basin is isolated to the high elevations of the Sacramento Mountains (Figure 6.6). This \ufb01gure shows PyRANA estimating diffuse recharge for the Salt Flats. Due to the evaporative nature of the Salt Flats, there is likely no diffuse recharge occurring in this area. Hence, areas of diffuse recharge outside of the northern Salt Basin are considered 113 Figure 6.4: Salt Basin data points with chloride and bromide concentrations, de- noted by corrected chloride recharge value; color-scaled to uncorrected chloride recharge value (lower uncorrected values are in red); chloride-mass-balance poly- gons"

Diffuse recharge in the Salt Basin is isolated to the high elevations of the Sacramento Mountains (Figure 6.6). This \ufb01gure shows PyRANA estimating diffuse recharge for the Salt Flats. Due to the evaporative nature of the Salt Flats, there is likely no diffuse recharge occurring in this area. Hence, areas of diffuse recharge outside of the northern Salt Basin are considered 113 Figure 6.4: Salt Basin data points with chloride and bromide concentrations, de- noted by corrected chloride recharge value; color-scaled to uncorrected chloride recharge value (lower uncorrected values are in red); chloride-mass-balance poly- gons outlined in orange erroneous. In contrast to diffuse recharge, focused recharge occurs mostly in the foothills and lowlands of the basin. The focused recharge happens primarily along ephemeral \ufb02ow channels where there is runoff. While this type of runoff is more common in the lowlands, it can also happen in the high elevation mountains. The total recharge estimate from PyRANA includes diffuse recharge in the Sacramento Mountains and focused recharge from mountainous runoff. Focused recharge in the lowlands was calculated as the amount of runoff times the average recharge fraction for each polygon from the chloride-mass-balance method. Hence, there is no independent PyRANA recharge estimate for the lowland polygons. Table 6.3 summarizes the recharge values from PyRANA for the mountainous polygons that includes diffuse and focused recharge from the mountains. The largest contributor of mountainous recharge from PyRANA is the Sacra- mento Mountains (5,407 acre-feet per year). Guadalupe Mountains diffuse recharge was the smallest contributor, adding 2,478 acre-feet per year. PyRANA estimated a total recharge from diffuse recharge alone to be 7,885 acre-feet per year. When adding in the lowland polygons recharge from the chloride-mass-balance 114 method, that used PyRANA runoff amounts, the total recharge from the PyRANA method is 13,000 acre-feet per year. 115 Year Annual Annual Volume Volume Annual Average Average Average ET-ed ET-ed Consumptive ETo Active Active for (m3/day) (acre- Use (acre- (m/day) Agriculture m2 feet/day feet/year 1984 0.0051 7006 70060000 360050.95 292.01 71543 1985 0.0051 5622 56220000 288063.96 233.63 57239 1986 0.0051 5693 56930000 289976.82 235.18 57619 1987 0.0051 6937 69370000 355272.98 288.14 70594 1988 0.0051 6221.784 62217843 316473.08 256.67 62884 1989 0.0053 5682.922 56829216 303806.06 246.4 60367 1990 0.0052 2584 25840000 134484.6 109.07 26722 1991 0.0051 5518 55180000 281650.55 228.43 55965 1992 0.0052 4315 43150000 225841.92 183.16 44875 1993 0.0053 4806 48060000 253070.51 205.25 50286 1994 0.0054 3930 39300000 211695.63 171.69 42064 1995 0.0053 5555.247 55552471 293347.35 237.91 58289 1996 0.0052 6447.639 64476392 336884.79 273.22 66940 1997 0.0053 5170 51700000 272811.39 221.26 54208 1998 0.0053 6477 64770000 345403.26 280.13 68632 1999 0.0053 7056.275 70562745 372055.99 301.75 73928 2000 0.0054 5573 55730000 302319.13 245.19 60072 2001 0.0054 5969 59690000 320484.71 259.92 63681 2002 0.0054 7085.435 70854353 386092.69 313.13 76718 2003 0.0054 7957 79570000 427654.14 346.84 84976 2004 0.0053 7854.004 78540039 415692.29 337.14 82599 2005 0.0052 8267 82670000 433149.83 351.3 86068 2006 0.0053 8274.639 82746392 437954.36 355.19 87023 2007 0.0053 8086 80860000 427176.27 346.45 84881 2008 0.0052 9199.169 91991686 479599.66 388.97 95298 2009 0.0054 5708 57080000 309342.96 250.89 61467 2010 0.0054 6433.455 64334549 348681 282.79 69284 2011 0.0054 5537 55370000 300998.63 244.12 59809 2012 0.0054 6032 60320000 328021.1 266.03 65179 2013 0.0053 6918 69180000 367125.51 297.75 72949 2014 0.0053 9064.078 90640784 481916.17 390.85 95758 2015 0.0053 8858 88580000 471817.32 382.66 93751 2016 0.0052 8041 80410000 419653.68 340.35 83386 2017 0.0052 8722 87220000 456017.31 369.84 90612 2018 0.0053 7319 73190000 391515.31 317.53 77795 2019 0.0052 6128 61280000 319799.53 259.37 63545 Table 6.1: Resulting annual consumptive use from Dell City irrigation district based on an annual average ETo from Blaney-Criddle and annual average active greenness hectares from Google Earth Engine using Appendix B.1 code; annual average ETo for March to October; annual average active greenness hectares for June to August; volume ET-ed is the volume evapotranspired from March to October 116 Figure 6.5: Chloride-mass-balance recharge fractions: corrected versus uncorrected to compare signi\ufb01cance of correction; points color-coded by CMB polygon 117 Watershed Area (m2) Area (acres) Runoffor Average Recharge (acre-ft/yr) or corrected Volume *Total Precip. recharge (acre-ft/yr) (acre-ft/yr) value North Draw 885254542.4 218743.4 4791.56 0.05 235 Pi\u02dcnon Creek 1834422459 453279.58 11678.33 0.2 2338 Sacramento River 1554425795 384093.35 11039.57 0.1 1054 Big Dog Canyon 431356974.2 106586.85 3825.78 0.05 193 Shiloh Draw 1012122889 250092.14 7746.71 0.02 169 Texas 7879196278 1946922.73 46572.14 0.02 867 Lowland CMB 4856 +PyRANA Total Sacramento 160332313 39617.57 *76132.57 0.29 22078 Mountains Guadalupe 117850264 29120.4 *48294.62 0.1 4628 Mountains Mountainous 26706 Total Total 31562 Table 6.2: Resulting recharge volumes from chloride-mass-balance for polygons in Figure 6.4; for Sacramento Mountains and Guadalupe Mountains, total precipita- tion (acre-feet/year) was used instead of PyRANA runoff, as designated by the asterisk Watershed Diffuse Recharge Mountain Focused Total recharge from recharge each area Sacramento 3194 2213 5407 Mountains Guadalupe 2478 2478 Mountains Mountainous PyRANA Total 7885 Lowland CMB/PyRANA Total 4856 Total PyRANA 12741 Table 6.3: Resulting mountainous recharge amounts from PyRANA with diffuse recharge and focused recharge; all values are in acre-feet/year 118 Figure 6.6: Aerial extent of diffuse recharge in the Salt Basin, focused within the high elevations of the Sacramento Mountains; diffuse recharge denoted outside of the northern Salt Basin are considered erroneous measurements from PyRANA 119 CHAPTER 7 WATER-BUDGET DISCUSSION 7.1 Water-Budget Assessment The basin-wide water balance includes discharge (i.e., ET) and recharge.

The Blaney-Criddle method produced an isolated measurement of discharge from the Dell City irrigation district and surrounding agricultural areas. This method contains inherent uncertainty, speci\ufb01cally due to the empirically de\ufb01ned p-value and the nearly exclusive reliance upon temperature data. In the future, the evapotranspiration from Salt Basin agriculture could be improved to further improve the overall water-budget, for example by using more advanced remote- sensing-based estimates of ET. This consumptive use output was not further used in this analysis, but it is important to note the amount of water leaving the Salt Basin hydrological system through this agriculture. In order to sustain the aquifer, this consumptive use, combined with any trans-basin extractions through pipelines, must remain below the recharge rate. For a further analysis of this sustainability and potential pumping well expansions, refer to Evenocheck (2021) [1]. The chloride-mass-balance method produced a recharge estimate for each polygon subsection of the Salt Basin. The distribution of corrected recharge frac- tions across the Salt Basin suggests relative volumes of recharge from each polygon. Higher recharge fractions along the northern margin of the Salt Basin suggests a large volume of recharge originating from the Sacramento Mountains. This aligns with the large contribution from the Sacramento Mountains, Pi\u02dcnon Creek, and Sacramento River polygons. The Shiloh Draw polygon contains some low recharge fractions that align with the Cornudas Mountains. Since the Cornudas Mountains are igneous intrusions that do not contain chloride, the chloride-to-bromide correction is likely not applicable in this region. However, there is minimal evidence to suggest that the Cornudas Mountain recharge con- tributes large volumes of recharge to the Salt Basin groundwater. In contrast, the Capitan Reef geologic province in the Texas-wide polygon has high recharge fractions. These high recharge fractions are likely due to Guadalupe Mountain recharge \ufb02ushing chloride through the system and producing small chloride-to- bromide ratios. Further, Antelope Draw and South Well Draw have low recharge fractions. This suggests a small recharge volume moving along these draws. The lack of chemical evidence suggesting karsti\ufb01cation and a small Texas-wide recharge supports the minimal recharge volume. If the CMB polygons were 120 separated to include these detailed recharge fractions patterns, the chloride-mass- balance recharge estimate would likely average to the same values; increased recharge from the Guadalupe Mountains counters decreased recharge from the rest of the Texas polygon. The chloride-mass-balance method is dependent upon the chemistry mea- surements and assumptions of chloride deposition and assumed volume of source waters (rainfall or runoff). Uncertainty due to the chloride deposition parameter is introduced because we have applied a modern chloride deposition rate, yet it is possible that the groundwaters are older than the Holocene. This old water would likely have a different atmospheric depositional rate of chloride due to different climatic variables. An analysis of the corrected radiocarbon ages for the chloride and bromide data points could help differentiate Holocene and Pleistocene waters so that the appropriate chloride depositional rate could be applied to each groundwater sample. The source water assumptions also intro- duce uncertainty, because we do not know the actual chloride concentration in the runoff that provides the source of recharge in most of the basin. We assume the same as rainfall, which is consistent with rainfall being the source of runoff, but it is possible that as it runs off the landscape it picks up additional chloride that had been deposited on the soil surface. If the chloride concentration of runoff were higher, this would increase our estimate of the fraction of runoff that becomes recharge in these portions of the basin. The chloride-mass-balance method and PyRANA soil-water-balance model produce independent recharge estimates for the mountainous polygons. Therefore, the two methods can be easily compared. Table 7.1 has the recharge amounts for each mountainous polygon from the chloride-mass-balance method and from the PyRANA estimate, as well as the total amounts for the lowland polygons from the combined chloride-mass-balance and PyRANA method. The primary polygon of each estimate is the same. The primary contributor to the chloride- mass-balance method is the Sacramento Mountains with 22,000 acre-feet per year, and the primary contributor to the PyRANA estimate is the Sacramento Mountains polygon with 5,500 acre-feet per year. According to the chloride-mass-balance method, a total of 27,000 acre-feet per year of recharge comes from the Sacramento and Guadalupe Mountains. PyRANA has 8,000 acre-feet per year attributed to the same aerial extent. Due to the assumptions going into each method, we are more con\ufb01dent in the recharge estimate from the chloride-mass-balance method. This method is more robust, since it relies on chloride and bromide concentrations of the ground- water samples. PyRANA relies on multiple parameter assumptions in creating a recharge estimate. Nonetheless, there are possible explanations for the chloride- mass-balance method being valid while the PyRANA estimate is an underestimate or for the chloride-mass-balance method being an overestimate while the PyRANA estimate is valid. For the \ufb01rst scenario of PyRANA underestimating recharge, the soil thickness is the determining factor. The relationship between recharge and soil thickness is non-linear, so a small change in soil thickness would cause a large change in estimated recharge.

Additional chloride in the representative groundwater would produce lower recharge rates than estimated by the chloride-mass-balance method. PyRANA is a relatively new recharge estimation method that requires addi- tional re\ufb01nement. For this study in particular, a regression against elevation and precipitation was necessary to extend the modeled runoff estimates into Texas. If the soil properties are signi\ufb01cantly different in Texas relative to the New Mexico training area, this extrapolation may be incorrect. As mentioned previously, there is a non-linear relationship between recharge and soil thickness. The PRISM pre- cipitation data for Texas was a coarser scale than the precipitation data for New Mexico. This and other assumptions should not signi\ufb01cantly alter the effective- ness of the PyRANA model, but it nonetheless adds uncertainty into the resulting soil-water-balance. The culmination of this study is shown in Table 7.2. The previous eleven recharge estimates had a range of 6,000 to 240,000 acre-feet per year. The addi- tional recharge estimate in association with this overall study is from Evenocheck (2021) [1] and used some of the results from this report. The recharge estimates from this study have a range of 13,000 to 32,000 acre-feet per year. While each method has associated uncertainties, these most recent recharge estimates con- strain the historic estimates. 122 Chloride-Mass-Balance + PyRANA total recharge 12741 to 31561 Pre-devlopement steady-state model recharge [1] 60487 Average recharge from transient model [1] 61259 Table 7.2: Resulting recharge amounts from combined chloride-mass-balance and PyRANA and [1]; transient model run from 1948 to 2020; all values are in acre-feet per year 123 CHAPTER 8 CONCLUSION The Salt Basin is a semiarid region shared by southeastern New Mexico and western Texas. This basin and the nearly 1,000 residents are at extreme risk of water supply sustainability over the next 30 years [3]. This study aims to constrain historic groundwater recharge estimates to provide a more speci\ufb01c water balance using hydrogeochemical and water balance analyses. Within the overall Salt Basin resource evaluation project funded by the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, there is also a groundwater model created that results in an independent recharge estimate of 60,000 acre-feet per year for the pre-development steady state model and 61,000 acre-feet per year for the average transient model [1]. The conclusions of this report and Evenocheck (2021) [1] will potentially be utilized to further basin development. Historic hydrological studies in the Salt Basin have noted the majority of diffuse groundwater recharge originates in the Sacramento Mountains along the northern Salt Basin margin. Secondary focused recharge occurs with monsoonal \ufb02ooding of ephemeral channels throughout the remainder of the basin. Since the Salt Basin is a hydrologically closed basin, all of the water that enters the Salt Basin through precipitation or groundwater in\ufb02ow must become groundwater recharge or evapotranspiration. However, the complex geology of the Salt Basin creates a complex groundwater \ufb02ow system. The primary and tertiary aquifers are carbonate facies with gypsum and halite species, while the secondary aquifer unit is Quaternary alluvium \ufb01ll. To separate the effects of each geologic province on the \ufb02ow paths, the groundwater was analyzed based on geologic province and then on a \ufb02ow path scale rather than a basin-wide scale. The hydrochemical analyses utilizes a historic chemical database from the U.S. Bureau of Geology and Mineral Resources. There is a data gap in the northwestern Salt Basin that coincides with the Fort Bliss-McGregor Range. The remainder of the Salt Basin is populated by data points, with a distinct concentration in and around Dell City, TX. Within the New Mexico portion of the Salt Basin, the major \ufb02ow paths within the New Mexico Carbonates geologic province are the Pi\u02dcnon Creek, Cornucopia Draw, Sacramento River, and Shiloh Draw. The Sacramento River, Pi\u02dcnon Creek, and Cornucopia Draw \ufb02ow paths \ufb02ow southwards into playas north of Dell City, TX. These three \ufb02ow paths show dedolomitization as the dominant chemical process. Hence, Dell City is a chemical combination of end dedolomitization waters from the Sacramento River, Pi\u02dcnon Creek, and Cornucopia Draw. Some of 124 this groundwater may be due to groundwater in\ufb02ow from the Pe\u02dcnasco Basin to the northeast. However, the possibility of in\ufb02ow was not explored in this study. Along the New Mexico-Texas state border, Shiloh Draw \ufb02ows generally eastwards towards Dell City as well. The Cornudas Mountains igneous intrusions alter the Shiloh Draw \ufb02ow path by mixing in silicious groundwater and redirecting the \ufb02ow path around the intrusions. This silicious groundwater is theorized, but not proven due to lack of groundwater samples from the Cornudas Mountains themselves. Western Texas has the coarsely fractured Cretaceous geologic province that complicate the W.Antelope Draw, W.South Well Draw, and E.Antelope Draw and E.South Well Draw \ufb02ow paths. The eastern \ufb02ow paths move into the Victorio Peak geologic province, but the chemistry of the Cretaceous is more dominant. There is a minor trend of dedolomitization within the Cretaceous and Victorio Peak geologic province, but there are no overall dominant chemical trends throughout these \ufb02ow paths. Instead, there are seemingly random concentrations of TDS, radiocarbon, and tritium throughout the area. The fractures offer an explanation for this variability. There is likely a mixing between fracture water and surrounding matrix waters. Waters within the fractures are mostly low TDS and high radiocarbon, suggesting recent recharge. Waters within the matrix are mostly high TDS and low radiocarbon, suggesting old recharge. These old waters in the matrix are similar to waters along the eastern margin of the Salt Basin, i.e., chemically evolved in- place. In support"

There is likely a mixing between fracture water and surrounding matrix waters. Waters within the fractures are mostly low TDS and high radiocarbon, suggesting recent recharge. Waters within the matrix are mostly high TDS and low radiocarbon, suggesting old recharge. These old waters in the matrix are similar to waters along the eastern margin of the Salt Basin, i.e., chemically evolved in- place. In support of this idea, the groundwater age of the groundwater should be re\ufb02ected in the tritium concentrations. Younger waters should have higher tritium concentrations and high radiocarbon activities. However, this trend is not seen in the data of Antelope Draw and South Well Draw. The lack of tritium trend can be explained by stratospheric nuclear weapons testing of the 1950s. Tritium and radiocarbon both peaked in the 1960s and these groundwater samples were collected in the 1980s. The tritium and radiocarbon peaks were not identical and could produce waters with high radiocarbon and low tritium and vice versa. This is likely the scenario that created the two end member waters of Antelope Draw and South Well Draw. The two waters mix as the old, high TDS waters diffuse out of the matrix and into the fractures. It is also possible that the waters are being mixed anthropogenically due to groundwater pumping forcing the two waters together. The eastern margin of the Salt Basin is comprised of the Capitan Reef geologic province. The limestone in this area also shows a minor dedolomitization trend with brine mixing in from the adjacent Salt Flats to the west. This chemical alteration is the same dedolomitization seen in the New Mexico portion of the Salt Basin, but a paralleled evolutionary trend with lower overall calcium and magnesium. Dell City, Texas hydrochemistry is affected by irrigation return \ufb02ow and Salt Flat brines south of Dell City. There is active pivot and \ufb02ood irrigation in Dell City that stimulates evapotranspiration. Irrigation water that is not lost to ET or incorporated into the crops returns to the groundwater system. However, this cycle of irrigation pumping, evapotranspiration, and irrigation return \ufb02ow causes 125 a concentration of salts as the fresh water is evapotranspired or incorporated. NDVI from Google Earth Engine in combination with the Blaney-Criddle method calculated an average amount of 69,000 acre-feet per year is the consumptive use of the Dell City irrigation district. Additionally, Dell City and the Salt Flats show an increase in chloride with a decrease in sulfate nearer to the Salt Flats. Since the primary aquifers of the Salt Basin are carbonates, radiocarbon corrections were required to calculate a corrected radiocarbon age for the Salt Basin. Carbon data points that could not be corrected were those with an unknown amount of carbonate dissolution. There were minimal carbon data throughout the Salt Basin that was able to be corrected. The Fontes and Garnier approach corrected the radiocarbon initial activities for isotopic exchange. These corrected ages for the New Mexico portion of the Salt Basin aligned in trend with groundwater ages from Sigstedt (2010) [14]. The corrected ages from Sigstedt (2010) [14] are considered to be more accurate due to the detail added to the radiocarbon correction method. For the data points within the Antelope Draw and South Well Draw, an alternative radiocarbon initial activity correction used a simple mixing model between the two end members, designated by respective calcium to sodium ratios. Both corrections resulted in variable corrected radiocarbon ages throughout the southwestern Salt Basin. This further supported the complex, two-waters \ufb02ow system. Water balance analyses used the chloride-mass-balance method and PyRANA to estimate groundwater recharge for the Salt Basin. The chloride-mass-balance was modi\ufb01ed to re\ufb02ect the amount of chloride introduced to the system from salt mineral dissolution. This modi\ufb01cation used the bromide concentration because chloride from rock-water interactions also releases bromide. Using a deep basin brine found in Cloudcroft, NM as the chloride end member and precipitation as the fresh water end member, the chloride-mass-balance created a mixing model curve. Comparing the curve to Salt Basin data, it was possible to determine the amount of mixing between atmospheric chloride and mineral dissolution chloride for delineated sub-watersheds. This mixing ratio was then converted into corrected recharge rate. For the mountainous polygons, the recharge rate was calculated using the precipitation rate, aerial extent of each sub-watershed, and the estimated mixing ratio for each mountainous polygon. For the lowland polygons, the recharge rate was calculated using the runoff volume for each lowland sub-watershed from PyRANA and the estimated mixing ratio for each lowland polygon. The total amount of recharge from the chloride-mass-balance method for the Salt Basin was 32,000 acre-feet per year. In comparison to the chloride-mass-balance method mountainous recharge estimate, PyRANA used multiple environmental parameters to estimate a soil- water-balance and thus calculate a range of recharge rates for the mountainous polygons. Diffuse recharge was isolated to the high elevations of the Sacramento Mountains along the northern margin of the Salt Basin. Additional recharge was contributed by focused recharge along ephemeral channels that originated in the mountainous polygons. The resulting total amount of recharge from the PyRANA soil-water-balance model for the Salt Basin was 13,000 acre-feet per year. The recharge estimate from the chloride-mass-balance method is assumed to be more accurate due to the simple chemistry inputs and limited assumptions. PyRANA is 126 sensitive to input parameters and multiple assumptions going into the recharge estimate. There are eleven primary historic recharge estimates that range from 6,000 to 240,000 acre-feet per year. Most of these previous estimates used different methods to estimate recharge, each with different associated uncertainties. This study used a groundwater \ufb02ow model [1], chloride-mass-balance, and PyRANA to estimate recharge. While these three methods also have associated uncertainties, the three recharge estimates constrain the previous recharge estimates to 13,000 to 32,000 acre-feet per year (16,000,000-40,000,000 m3/yr.)"

I recommend that a water-budget plan be implemented to ensure the groundwater pumping from the semiarid Salt Basin is sustainable. 127 REFERENCES [1] Elizabeth Evenocheck.
