The text presents several statements, some explicitly affirming that the study defined the aquifer extent in two dimensions (using contour maps, potentiometric surfaces, and structural contour maps), and others suggesting there is not enough information to confirm a 2D definition. A few statements even indicate a focus on three-dimensional modeling or on characterizing faults rather than outlining the aquifer in 2D. Overall, the recurring theme is the use of mapping techniques—particularly contour maps and mapped hydrostratigraphic units—that typically represent aquifer characteristics horizontally, implying at least some level of 2D delineation, even though certain passages note insufficient detail or emphasize other aspects (like 3D fault analysis) beyond a purely two-dimensional approach.
