This study produced a water table map of the Tularosa Basin, including both a basin-wide depiction and a regional map referencing the work by Embid and Finch (2011). The maps highlight groundwater flow directions, closed contours (indicating possible evaporative discharge zones), and integrate data primarily taken from 2009 to 2011 depth-to-water measurements. Older water table contours are included along the eastern margin. The studyâ€™s goal was to illustrate regional flow characteristics, noting that groundwater levels can fluctuate significantly near pumping wells.
