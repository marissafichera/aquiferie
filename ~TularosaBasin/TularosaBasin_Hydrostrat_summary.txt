This text explains how the hydrostratigraphy of an aquifer in the Tularosa Basin was delineated by integrating multiple lines of evidence. Although not always labeled explicitly as “defining hydrostratigraphy,” the information presented—ranging from historical USGS reports to recent mapping studies—sheds light on the aquifer’s geological framework. Key data sets include:

• Historical and contemporary water-table maps showing groundwater occurrence and flow directions.  
• Groundwater investigations on military and testing ranges, which detail water quality and depth data.  
• Salinity and total dissolved solids (TDS) measurements identifying zones of saline and fresh water.  
• Geological studies revealing lacustrine deposits, permeable sand units, and fractured bedrock.  
• Isotopic analyses (e.g., sulfur isotopes) indicating groundwater flow paths and geochemical processes.  
• Drillers’ records, well-screen data, and measurements of hydraulic gradients and connectivity among different stratigraphic layers.

From these various sources, the study constructs a picture of the aquifer’s layered geology (e.g., basin fill sediments, fractured carbonates, volcaniclastic deposits) and how water moves and is stored within these strata, thereby defining the aquifer’s hydrostratigraphy.
