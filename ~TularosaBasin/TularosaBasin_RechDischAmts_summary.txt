This text describes a groundwater study focused on understanding aquifer characteristics and groundwater flow rather than providing explicit, numerical recharge or discharge rates. The study emphasizes:  
• Identifying major recharge sources (primarily along key stream systems) and noting that many springs have low discharge rates (under 6 gallons per minute).  
• Using aquifer test data to determine transmissivity, storage coefficients, and hydraulic continuity.  
• Employing geochemical and isotopic tools (including CFCs and tritium) to estimate groundwater ages and infer recharge times.  
• Referring to Darcy flow calculations to estimate volumetric flow, which implies some level of recharge-rate quantification, though specific figures are not detailed.  

Overall, while the report analyzes aquifer properties and groundwater age data, it does not provide detailed numerical values for recharge or discharge rates in the sections discussed. Instead, it relies on indirect methods (aquifer testing, geochemical tracers, and flow calculations) to infer how water moves in the basin and where recharge likely occurs.
