This study centers on the gypsum sand aquifer beneath the dune field at White Sands National Park, with additional focus on the Tularosa Basin’s broader regional groundwater system. Aquifers in the basin include: (1) fractured carbonate, mudstone, and siltstone formations from the Permian age (San Andres, Yeso, and Abo); (2) late Cretaceous to early Eocene sandstones and related deposits (Sanders Canyon, Cub Mountain, Crevasse Canyon, and Gallup); (3) Sierra Blanca volcanic flows and volcaniclastic sediments (late Eocene–early Oligocene); (4) late Eocene–Quaternary basin fill (QTBF); and (5) valley fill (QUAL). These formations feature varied permeabilities and supply groundwater across the region.
