This text describes a comprehensive set of data sources and methods used to create a water table elevation map (or depth-to-water map) for the Tularosa Basin. Key points include:

• Multiple data sources:  
  – Groundwater measurements from various wells (municipal, irrigation, domestic, etc.).  
  – Historical and recent water chemistry data (NMBGMR, USGS, NMED).  
  – Geophysical surveys (electrical resistivity).  
  – Subsurface data (well logs, lithologic records).  
  – Published and unpublished hydrologic and geologic studies.  

• New data collection efforts (2009–2012):  
  – Depth-to-water measurements (one-time and repeated).  
  – Continuous water-level recorders.  
  – GPS for precise site location.  
  – Geological mapping at 1:24,000 scale and cross sections.  
  – Geochemical, isotopic, and environmental tracer sampling.  

• Analytical tools and techniques:  
  – GIS-based spatial analysis of groundwater levels and water table contours.  
  – Use of a 10-meter DEM for land surface elevations.  
  – Integration of historical water-level data from the NM OSE and Sloan and Garber’s 1971 map.  

Collectively, these diverse datasets and methods enabled a detailed understanding of the groundwater system, illustrating water table elevations, flow directions, and basin-wide hydrologic boundaries.
