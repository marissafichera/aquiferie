The referenced aquifer report sections draw upon a wide range of groundwater data sources in the Tularosa Basin and nearby areas. They include: groundwater and surface water samples (from wells and the Lost River) analyzed for pH, specific conductance, temperature, dissolved oxygen, general chemistry, trace metals, and multiple isotopes and tracers (including tritium, carbon-14, and CFCs). Data also come from depth-to-water measurements and static water levels documented by the New Mexico Bureau of Geology and Mineral Resources, the New Mexico Office of the State Engineer, and various hydrologic consultantsâ€™ reports. Historical well records and lithologic logs provide subsurface geological context, while spring elevations and environmental tracer sampling help in assessing long-term trends and sources of groundwater quality. Taken together, these sources offer a comprehensive snapshot of both historical and contemporary water quality conditions and help guide understanding of groundwater flow, composition, and potential contamination concerns in the region.
