This collection of statements indicates that a study of the Tularosa Basin does indeed analyze water quality data, drawing on both historical and newly collected samples. Multiple references name sources (e.g., NMBGMR, USGS, NMED) and types of analyses (major ions, trace metals, stable isotopes, and environmental tracers). Several wells and at least one surface water site were sampled, and field parameters like pH, specific conductance, temperature, and dissolved oxygen were measured. Although one portion of the text suggests the study may not discuss water quality data, the overwhelming majority of the statements clarify that water-quality assessments—including geochemical and isotopic testing—were central to understanding spatial trends, potential aquifer connectivity, and data gaps within the basin.
