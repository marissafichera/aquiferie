"From the information provided, the study appears to be the “Carlsbad Area Ground Water (CAGW) Model.”

o3-mini Evaluation:
Correct?: No

Explanation: The report does not explicitly state that the study’s title is ""Carlsbad Area Ground Water (CAGW) Model."" Although the text references the “CAGW” and discusses aspects such as the active model layer one, this appears as a component of the study rather than its title. Additionally, the URL includes “Barroll2004_Final CAGW Report,” which implies that the document is a final report on the CAGW project rather than being formally titled “Carlsbad Area Ground Water (CAGW) Model.”

Corrected Answer (if needed): The title of the study appears to be indicated by the file name as ""Barroll2004_Final CAGW Report _1.26.04.pdf.""","The study focuses on two principal aquifers in the Carlsbad Basin: the Quaternary Pecos Valley Alluvium (alluvial aquifer) and the Permian Capitan Reef (reef aquifer).

o3-mini Evaluation:
Correct?: Yes  
Explanation: The report clearly states that the principal aquifers in the Carlsbad Basin are the Quaternary Pecos Valley Alluvium (alluvial aquifer) and the Permian Capitan Reef (reef aquifer). For example, Section 2.1 of the report mentions, ""The principal aquifers in the Carlsbad Basin are the Quaternary Pecos Valley Alluvium (alluvial aquifer) and the Permian Capitan Reef (reef aquifer).""  
Corrected Answer (if needed): N/A","Yes. They took maps from Bjorklund and Motts (1959) and delineated the lateral (plan-view) boundaries of the alluvial aquifer based on those maps, effectively defining its 2D extent in the model. They also specified the base elevation to give the aquifer a third dimension, but its areal extent was primarily taken from the referenced 2D mapping.

o3-mini Evaluation:
Correct?: Yes

Explanation: The report states that ""the extent of the alluvial aquifer layer in the model was based largely on maps presented in Figures 1 and 3 from the Bjorklund and Motts (1959) report."" It also explains that the lateral (plan-view) boundaries were delineated using these maps, confirming the 2D definition.

Corrected Answer (if needed): N/A","No. The excerpt does not describe how the base of the aquifer was defined, nor does it mention any data for that purpose.

o3-mini Evaluation:
Correct?: Yes  
Explanation: The report excerpt does not mention any definition or data used to define the base of the aquifer. There is no reference to the base in the text regarding data collection, measurement, or model calibration.  
Corrected Answer (if needed): No, the study did not define the base of the aquifer, nor did it mention any data used for that purpose.","The report does not indicate that the authors released a standalone digital product (e.g., a GIS shapefile) delineating the aquifer extent. They describe how the aquifer footprint was primarily derived from earlier maps, particularly Bjorklund and Motts (1959), and incorporated into a MODFLOW model with a finite-difference grid referenced to UTM NAD83. However, there is no explicit mention of a published digital dataset defining the aquifer’s boundary.

o3-mini Evaluation:
Correct?: Yes

Explanation: The report does not mention the publication of a standalone digital product that delineates the aquifer's boundary. Instead, it describes deriving the aquifer extent from earlier maps—specifically, Bjorklund and Motts (1959)—and incorporating it into a MODFLOW model using a finite-difference grid referenced to UTM NAD83. For example, in section 3.2.1, the report states: ""The extent of the alluvial aquifer layer... was based largely on maps presented in Figures 1 and 3 from the Bjorklund and Motts (1959) report."" There is no indication that this was released as a digital product.

Corrected Answer (if needed): The report does not indicate that a digital product, such as a GIS shapefile, defining the aquifer extent was published. Instead, the aquifer extent was derived from earlier maps (e.g., Bjorklund and Motts, 1959) and implemented within a MODFLOW grid using UTM NAD83 coordinates.","Yes. They relied primarily on Bjorklund and Motts (1959) for defining the alluvial aquifer’s extent and basal elevations, supplemented by NM OSE lithologic (drillers’) logs to refine the geologic horizons and identify areas with semiconfined conditions.

o3-mini Evaluation:
Correct?: Yes  
Explanation: The report states that hydrostratigraphy was primarily defined using Bjorklund and Motts (1959) for establishing the extent and basal elevations of the alluvial aquifer (e.g., ""The extent of the alluvial aquifer layer in the model was based largely on maps... from the Bjorklund and Motts (1959) report"" and “For most of the model area, these elevations were taken from Figure 16 in Bjorklund and Motts (1959).”) and supplemented with NM OSE lithologic (drillers’) logs, which helped refine the geologic horizons and identify semiconfined areas.  
Corrected Answer (if needed): Yes. The study defined the hydrostratigraphy of the aquifer by primarily using maps and data (e.g., extent and basal elevations) from Bjorklund and Motts (1959), and it supplemented this with NM OSE lithologic (drillers’) logs to refine geologic horizons and delineate areas with semiconfined conditions.","Yes. The report indicates that a subsurface bedrock “ridge” isolates the upper Black River from the Carlsbad Valley and affects groundwater flow. This feature—along with the base of the aquifer where it overlies the Capitan Reef—serves as a structural control (i.e., no‐flow boundary). The primary data used to define these controls include geologic maps from Bjorklund and Motts (1959) and lithologic logs that helped delineate the alluvial aquifer base and the subsurface “ridge.”

o3-mini Evaluation:
Correct?: Yes

Explanation: The answer correctly indicates that the report defined structural controls, citing both the subsurface bedrock “ridge” that isolates the upper Black River and the aquifer base over the Capitan Reef as no‐flow boundaries. It also correctly notes that geologic maps (Bjorklund and Motts, 1959) and lithologic logs were used to define these features. For example, the report states, ""Land along the upper Black River, however, is not included in the CAGW. The upper Black River is hydrologically isolated ... by a subsurface bedrock 'ridge'"" and, ""The base of the alluvial aquifer is treated as a no-flow boundary except where the alluvial aquifer overlies the Capitan Reef."" 

Corrected Answer (if needed): No correction needed.","The report does not explicitly label “recharge zones” and “discharge zones” by name. However, it does describe how recharge is represented at Cass Draw (based on proportional recharge estimates from Dark Canyon) and how most of the model boundaries are treated as no‐flow (i.e., no lateral inflow or outflow), except where flux is assigned to simulate underflow. Thus, although not formally called “recharge” or “discharge” zones, the few cells along the western border receiving flux from Cass Draw are effectively the defined recharge area, and the rest of the model boundaries generally prohibit lateral in‐ or outflow. The recharge estimates came from watershed data (comparing Cass Draw to Dark Canyon), and the discharge mechanism is primarily through pumping and flow to the Pecos River.

o3-mini Evaluation:
Correct?: Yes

Explanation: The answer correctly notes that the report does not explicitly define “recharge zones” or “discharge zones” by name. It accurately references that recharge at Cass Draw is based on the proportional recharge from Dark Canyon (using watershed area comparisons), while most model boundaries are treated as no-flow except for a western cell flux simulating underflow. For example, the report states: “The recharge to Cass draw was based upon the recharge to Dark Canyon, then adjusted downward proportionally to the areas of the watersheds of Cass Draw and Dark Canyon,” and “The lateral boundaries of the alluvial aquifer are generally treated as no‐flow boundaries…the exception … assigned to a few model cells to simulate underflow from upper Cass Draw.”

Corrected Answer (if needed): No correction needed.","Yes. Recharge was quantified by measuring and estimating infiltration from ephemeral flows in Dark Canyon (using gage data from 1973–1990) and applying a fixed annual recharge volume in Cass Draw (585 AF/yr). On-farm return flow was also included based on Blair’s (1992) estimates. Discharge was primarily quantified through irrigation well pumping estimates derived from metered data (1994–1995) and correlated with historical information (e.g., 1954 data) to represent pumping over the model’s timeframe.

o3-mini Evaluation:
Correct?: Yes

Explanation: The answer correctly cites the report’s details. For recharge, the report states that recharge estimates come from measurements in Dark Canyon using gage data from 1973–1990 and a fixed recharge value of 585 AF/yr at Cass Draw. It also notes that on-farm return flow was distributed using Blair’s (1992) estimates. For discharge, the report described estimation of irrigation well pumping using metered data from 1994–1995, supplemented with historical data (e.g., Bjorklund and Motts 1959 for 1954 values) to cover the modeled period.

Corrected Answer (if needed): No correction needed.","From the tables provided (which list “Water Level Elevation [feet]” for each well), the study almost certainly generated maps of groundwater‐level elevations (i.e., water‐table or potentiometric‐surface maps), rather than just depth‐to‐water maps. The data explicitly give elevations rather than depths, indicating that the resulting contour maps would show the aquifer’s potentiometric surface (or water table, if unconfined).

o3-mini Evaluation:
Correct?: Yes  
Explanation: The report's tables list “Water Level Elevation (feet)” for each well under both ""Observed"" and ""Modeled"" columns. This supports that the study generated maps showing groundwater-level elevations—i.e., maps of the water table or potentiometric surface rather than merely depth-to-water values.  
Corrected Answer (if needed): No correction needed; the original answer is accurate.","They were primarily based on water‐level measurements gathered through the USGS GWSI observation well network (from 1948 onward) and additional water‐level data collected by the NM OSE in the summer of 1995 and January 1996. These measurements (in both the alluvial aquifer and the Capitan Reef aquifer) provide the water table elevations and hydraulic heads needed to produce water table or potentiometric surface maps.

o3-mini Evaluation:
Correct?: Yes

Explanation: The answer correctly states that water-level measurements from the USGS GWSI observation well network (since 1948) and additional data from the NM OSE in summer 1995 and January 1996 were used. The report states, ""an observation well network maintained by the USGS under its Ground Water Site Inventory (GWSI) program provides information on water table elevations in the alluvial aquifer and hydraulic heads in the Capitan Reef aquifer,"" and it adds that ""the NM OSE obtained water level data from a large set of wells completed in the alluvial aquifer in the summer of 1995 and January of 1996."" 

Corrected Answer (if needed): They were based primarily on water‐level measurements collected through the USGS GWSI observation well network (from 1948 onward) and additional water‐level data collected by the NM OSE in the summer of 1995 and January 1996, which provided the necessary water table and potentiometric surface information for mapping.","They were largely taken from the NM OSE’s 1995–1996 measurements (i.e., collected for the study) but also drawn from the OSE’s GWSI dataset—so effectively both new data collection and compilation from existing sources.

o3-mini Evaluation:
Correct?: Yes  
Explanation: The report states that ""NM OSE obtained water level data from a large set of wells completed in the alluvial aquifer in the summer of 1995 and January of 1996"" and also discusses the use of GWSI data (e.g., ""the best available data set for water levels"") that was compiled from existing sources. This supports the answer that both newly collected measurements and compiled data from the GWSI dataset were used.  
Corrected Answer (if needed): They were collected during the study in 1995–1996 and supplemented with pre-existing data from the GWSI dataset.","No, there is no mention in these sections of collection or analysis of water chemistry data. The text discusses water level measurements, but does not address major ions, isotopes, pH, salinity, or specific conductance.

o3-mini Evaluation:
Correct?: Yes

Explanation: The report only discusses water level measurements, recharge estimations, and model calibration based on hydrologic data. There is no mention of water chemistry parameters like major ions, isotopes, pH, salinity, or specific conductance. For example, the text under ""5.0 OBSERVATIONAL DATA"" focuses on water level data from wells and makes no reference to any chemical analyses.

Corrected Answer (if needed): No, the study does not include water chemistry data such as major ions, isotopes, pH, salinity, or specific conductance.","There is no direct mention of water chemistry data in the sections provided. They discuss water levels, streamflow, and pumping updates but do not describe water chemistry sampling or sources. Therefore, based on the excerpt alone, it is not clear whether any new water chemistry data were collected or compiled from other sources.

o3-mini Evaluation:
Correct?: Yes

Explanation: The report excerpt only discusses water level elevations, streamflow data, pumping updates, and associated water data (e.g., effluent volumes and diversions). There is no mention of water chemistry sampling or data compilation, which supports the conclusion that water chemistry data were neither specifically collected nor detailed in the provided sections.

Corrected Answer (if needed): There is no indication in the provided excerpt that water chemistry data were either newly collected or compiled from external sources; the text exclusively focuses on hydrologic parameters such as water levels and streamflow data.","The report sections you provided do not specify any explicit sources for water chemistry data. Although there is brief mention of total dissolved solids (TDS) and petroleum influences in some wells, no dedicated water chemistry dataset or its provenance is described in the text. Thus, based on the provided information, the particular sources of water chemistry data are not identified.

o3-mini Evaluation:
Correct?: Yes

Explanation: The provided report does not explicitly mention any dedicated water chemistry data sources. While there is a brief reference to total dissolved solids (TDS) and petroleum influences (notably in the discussion of reef aquifer water variations), the report does not detail any specific datasets or their origins for water chemistry.

Corrected Answer (if needed): The report does not identify any particular sources for water chemistry data. Although it briefly mentions total dissolved solids (TDS) and petroleum influences in relation to groundwater density, there is no section describing a dedicated water chemistry dataset or its provenance.","Yes. The text explicitly discusses hydraulic conductivity (K), storage properties (including specific yield, Sy, and specific storage), and also refers to aquifer permeability and specific capacity (which can inform transmissivity). It does not report porosity values directly.

o3-mini Evaluation:
Correct?: Yes

Explanation: The report explicitly discusses hydraulic conductivity (e.g., ""Ka = 200 ft/day"", ""Ka = 10 ft/day"", ""Ka = 50 ft/day"", ""Ka = 110 ft/day""), storage properties including specific yield (Sy values of 0.02 and 0.10), and aquifer permeability inferred from specific capacity tests (e.g., specific capacity values expressed in gpm/ft). It also alludes to the concept of transmissivity via these parameters but does not provide porosity values.

Corrected Answer (if needed): No correction needed; the original answer accurately reflects the properties reported in the study.","They published specific values for reef hydraulic conductivity (e.g., 750 ft/day), reef storativity (0.005), vertical leakance (about 0.01 ft/day/ft), and alluvial hydraulic conductivity (eight zones, including one with 200 ft/day). These were determined through a combination of aquifer tests (specific capacity data), literature review (e.g., Hiss 1975a), and model calibration to observed water levels and flows.

o3-mini Evaluation:
Correct?: Yes  
Explanation: The answer accurately reflects the report. It identifies the published hydrogeologic properties (reef hydraulic conductivity at 750 ft/day, reef storativity at 0.005, vertical leakance of about 0.01 ft/day/ft, and alluvial hydraulic conductivity in eight zones including one with 200 ft/day) and correctly notes that these values were derived through a combination of approaches, including using aquifer test data (specific capacity measurements), literature references (e.g., Hiss 1975a), and model calibration to observed hydraulic heads and flows. For example, the report states, ""an extremely large hydraulic conductivity of 750 ft/day"" and ""S value of 0.005 best reproduced the observed seasonal variations"" and explains the leakance value matching simulated and observed heads.  
Corrected Answer (if needed): N/A","No explicit bounding‐box coordinates are given in the text. However, based on the places mentioned (Carlsbad, Lake Avalon, and the Guadalupe Mountains to the west), the study area appears to lie roughly between about 31.9°N and 32.6°N latitude, and −104.8°W and −103.8°W longitude. This is an approximation inferred from the report’s geographic references; the document does not provide exact corner points.

o3-mini Evaluation:
Correct?: Yes

Explanation: The report does not provide explicit bounding‐box coordinates. The answer correctly notes that the report only makes indirect geographic references (such as Carlsbad, Lake Avalon, and the Guadalupe Mountains) and that the bounding box provided is an approximation inferred from these references.

Corrected Answer (if needed): No explicit bounding box is given in the report. However, based on geographic references—such as recharge areas near Carlsbad, Lake Avalon, and the Guadalupe Mountains—the study area can be approximately defined by latitudes 31.9°N to 32.6°N and longitudes −104.8°W to −103.8°W.","Future work recommendations focus on updating and refining key model inputs and processes. First, the study advises revisiting the irrigated acreages assigned in the model; because the current version uses 1950s-era data, a revision should incorporate more recent acreage changes and water-right transfers to ensure realistic simulation of irrigation operations. Second, there is a recommendation to investigate phreatophyte evapotranspiration (ET) more rigorously; the current model treats phreatophyte ET as part of groundwater discharge to the Pecos River, and a dedicated quantitative study of this process could improve simulation accuracy. These steps would help ensure that any updated version of the model better reflects current conditions and improves predictive capabilities.

o3-mini Evaluation:
Correct?: Yes  
Explanation: The answer correctly identifies the two future work recommendations from the report. It references the need to update the irrigated acreages (due to outdated 1950s-era data and changes in water rights) and the recommendation to study phreatophyte evapotranspiration more rigorously. Specifically, the report states, ""the irrigated acreages... have been taken out of production, and some of the water rights... transferred"" and recommends ensuring that updated acreages be used, as well as, ""further quantitative study of phreatophyte ET"" (Appendix H and I).

Correct?: Yes  
Explanation: The report excerpt does not explicitly state the study title. The original answer correctly notes that the title is not directly provided in the text, instead it only identifies details such as the publication in Mine Water and the Environment (2015, vol. 34, pp. 223–230) and that the study deals with groundwater modeling for the Ochoa Project.  
Corrected Answer (if needed): No correction needed; the original answer is accurate in stating that the exact title of the study is not given in the excerpt.","The study primarily focuses on the Capitan aquifer.

o3-mini Evaluation:
Correct?: Yes  
Explanation: The report repeatedly refers to the Capitan aquifer, including detailed descriptions of its thickness, hydraulic conductivity, and the well field area (e.g., “the Capitan aquifer ranges from 240 to 670 m thick” and “in the area of the Ochoa well field…”), clearly establishing it as the aquifer of focus.  
Corrected Answer (if needed): The study primarily focuses on the Capitan aquifer.","Yes. The study specifies a horizontal (2D) model domain—from near Carlsbad, New Mexico, to the Glass Mountains in Texas—using MODFLOW-2000 with a uniform 609 m × 609 m grid, thereby defining the aquifer’s areal extent in two dimensions.

o3-mini Evaluation:
Correct?: Yes  
Explanation: The report states that the aquifer was modeled using MODFLOW-2000 on a uniform grid with spacing of 609 m by 609 m and that the model domain extends from near Carlsbad, New Mexico, to the Glass Mountains in Texas. This clearly defines the aquifer’s horizontal (2D) areal extent.  
Corrected Answer (if needed): N/A","Yes. In the study area, the base of the Capitan aquifer was set at approximately 1,642 m below ground surface. This was determined primarily from well logs (including oil and gas well logs) and other subsurface data sources that delineated where the Capitan aquifer transitioned into the underlying Delaware Mountain Group.

o3-mini Evaluation:
Correct?: Yes  
Explanation: The report clearly states that in the study area, the bottom of the Capitan aquifer is at approximately 1,642 m below ground surface (""the bottom is about 1,642 m bgs""). It also mentions that aquifer thickness and depth were identified using logs from many oil and gas wells in the region, which provided the data needed to delineate the aquifer’s boundaries.  
Corrected Answer (if needed): No correction needed; the original answer is accurate.","None of these references explicitly state that a digital dataset delineating the aquifer extent was released. Several of the cited works (such as the Papadopulos 2008 groundwater model and the Texas Water Development Board 2010 report) involve mapping or modeling, but there is no direct indication in the listed sources of a separately published digital product defining the aquifer’s boundaries.

o3-mini Evaluation:
Correct?: Yes

Explanation: The report’s references mention several mapping and modeling efforts (e.g., Papadopulos 2008’s Carlsbad area groundwater model and the Texas Water Development Board 2010 report) but none of the cited sources explicitly state that a separate digital dataset or product was published that specifically delineated the aquifer’s boundaries.

Corrected Answer (if needed): None.","Yes. The study identifies and describes the confining units (Salado Formation, Delaware Mountain Group, and Artesia Group) around the Capitan aquifer and delineates the aquifer’s thickness and depth using logs from numerous oil and gas wells in the region, along with other supporting data sources (e.g., electrical logs).

o3-mini Evaluation:
Correct?: Yes

Explanation: The report describes the hydrostratigraphy by defining the confining units (e.g., “the Capitan aquifer is confined above by the Salado Formation and both laterally and beneath by the Delaware Mountain and Artesia Groups”) and states that ""aquifer thickness and depth were identified using logs from the large number of oil and gas wells in the region,"" along with other supporting data sources such as electrical logs.

Corrected Answer (if needed): No correction needed.","Yes. The report describes submarine canyons (e.g., West Laguna submarine canyon) and a constriction at the Eddy/Lea County line that act as structural controls on groundwater flow. These features were mainly characterized using geophysical (electrical) logs and oil and gas well logs, which revealed zones of low permeability and the extent of canyon infilling materials (carbonate debris, sandstones, siltstones).

o3-mini Evaluation:
Correct?: Yes

Explanation: The report clearly identifies structural controls on groundwater flow, such as submarine canyons (e.g., the West Laguna submarine canyon) and a constriction near the Eddy/Lea County line. It specifies that electrical logs (used to analyze submarine canyon fill materials) and oil and gas well logs (used to determine aquifer thickness and depth) were employed to define these subsurface structures. For example, the text states, ""Electrical logs suggest that the submarine canyons are almost completely filled with a mixture of carbonate debris, sandstones, and siltstones,"" and later mentions, ""Aquifer thickness and depth were identified using logs from the large number of oil and gas wells in the region."" 

Corrected Answer (if needed): N/A","Yes. The glass‐mountain area in Texas was defined as a key recharge zone (based on precipitation, topographic, geologic, and soil data) and the Pecos River near Carlsbad Spring in New Mexico was identified as a main discharge zone. The study used well logs, water‐level data, and calibrated recharge estimates (derived from precipitation and runoff calculations) to delineate these zones.

o3-mini Evaluation:
Correct?: Yes

Explanation: The report indicates that recharge is defined using estimates for the Glass Mountains area—derived from methods that account for precipitation, topography, geologic, and soil characteristics. It also notes that historically the Capitan aquifer discharged into the Pecos River near Carlsbad Spring. In addition, the study used data such as well logs (to determine aquifer thickness and extent), water‐level measurements from pumping tests, and calibrated recharge estimates (derived from precipitation and runoff calculations) to delineate these recharge and discharge features.

Corrected Answer (if needed): The study did define recharge and discharge zones. Recharge was defined by using recharge estimates from the Glass Mountains area in Texas—calculated by considering precipitation, topographic, geologic, and soil characteristics (initially estimated at 173 L/s and later calibrated to 70 L/s). Discharge was identified through the historical evidence that the Capitan aquifer discharged into the Pecos River at Carlsbad Spring in New Mexico. Additional supporting data included well logs and water‐level measurements from exploratory well tests, which helped characterize the aquifer properties and constrain the model domain.","Yes. For recharge, the study initially used a method adapted from Beach et al. (2004) to estimate inflow of 173 L/s from the Glass Mountains, which considered precipitation, topography, geologic, and soil data. That estimate was then reduced to 70 L/s during model calibration. They also analyzed discharge primarily by looking at reduced groundwater discharge to the Pecos River, using the Carlsbad Area Groundwater (CAGW) model to assess impacts on river leakage.

o3-mini Evaluation:
Correct?: Yes

Explanation: The report specifies that recharge was quantified by initially estimating an inflow of 173 L/s from the Glass Mountains using a method adapted from Beach et al. (2004) that considered precipitation, topography, and geologic and soil characteristics, and then reducing this estimate to 70 L/s during model calibration. For discharge, the report refers to analyzing reduced groundwater discharge to the Pecos River using the Carlsbad Area Groundwater (CAGW) model and its superposition (CAGWsup) model to assess impacts from pumping.

Corrected Answer (if needed): N/A","They do not explicitly state that any water‐level or potentiometric‐surface maps were produced or shown. Although the modeling effort very likely involved simulating and comparing water‐level distributions (as is standard practice in groundwater modeling), the text itself does not say they generated or published actual “water table” or “potentiometric surface” maps.

o3-mini Evaluation:
Correct?: Yes

Explanation: The report does not explicitly state that any maps of water table elevation, depth to water, piezometric surface, or potentiometric surface were produced. Although the study involved simulation of water‐level distributions as part of the groundwater modeling process—for example, “Water levels were monitored in the pumping and observation wells” and the use of the MODFLOW model—the text itself does not claim that maps were generated or published.

These measurements came from state and federal agency records (e.g., USGS, state water agencies), compiled well logs, and regional groundwater studies.

o3-mini Evaluation:
Correct?: Yes  
Explanation: The answer accurately notes that the maps were primarily constructed using water‐level measurements in wells (e.g., static water levels and pumping‐test data) as referenced by studies such as Hiss (1975 and 1980), Mercer (1983), Hood and Kister (1962), Papadopulos (2008), and the Texas Water Development Board (2010).

Explanation: The answer selectively lists a few references (Hood and Kister, Mercer, Leedshill‐Herkenhoff et al., and the Texas Water Development Board report) without clear justification from the text. The report’s reference list does not explicitly separate “water chemistry” data sources, and several other items (e.g., Papadopulos (2008), the Mine Water Environ (2015) publication, or even sections within other reports) could be relevant. No direct quotes or sections indicate that only the cited references provide water chemistry data.

Corrected Answer (if needed): Based on the report’s references, water chemistry data sources appear to include at least the following:
• Hood JW and Kister LR (1962), “Saline-water resources of New Mexico” (USGS Water Supply Paper 1601), which likely provides chemical analyses of saline groundwater.
• Mercer JW (1983), “Geohydrology of the proposed waste isolation pilot plant site,” which may contain water quality and compositional data.
• Leedshill-Herkenhoff et al. (2000), “Final report, Lea County regional water plan,” which includes regional water sampling information.
• Texas Water Development Board (2010), “Aquifers of West Texas,” which likely documents groundwater chemical characteristics.
Additionally, water chemistry information might also be inferred from modeling studies (e.g., Papadopulos (2008) and the related MODFLOW documentation) and the Mine Water Environ (2015) publication. However, the report does not distinctly label “water chemistry” sources, so a broader interpretation is needed.","Yes. The study specifically reports hydraulic conductivity (with ranges and specific values) and transmissivity. It also references storativity (“storage coefficient”) as derived from the aquifer test. However, it does not provide explicit values for porosity, permeability, specific yield, or specific storage in the sections quoted.

o3-mini Evaluation:
Correct?: Yes  
Explanation: The report details hydraulic conductivity with specific values (e.g., 229 m/day west of the Pecos River and 0.3–7.6 m/day east of it) and discusses transmissivity and storativity as determined from the aquifer test. There are no explicit values for porosity, permeability, specific yield, or specific storage in the quoted text.  
Corrected Answer (if needed): The study reports hydraulic conductivity (with specific ranges and values) and transmissivity, and it estimates storativity (or storage coefficient) from the aquifer test. However, it does not provide explicit values for porosity, permeability, specific yield, or specific storage.","Specific hydrogeologic properties (e.g., hydraulic conductivity, transmissivity, and storativity) were reported and were determined primarily by conducting step-drawdown tests and a 7-day pumping test with a 23-day recovery period in the newly drilled wells, supplemented by analyzing well logs (including oil and gas well logs) and referencing earlier studies (e.g., Hiss 1975, Barroll et al. 2004).

o3-mini Evaluation:
Correct?: Yes

Explanation: The report details that specific hydrogeologic properties were derived from both step-drawdown tests and an aquifer (pumping) test conducted over 7 days with a subsequent 23-day recovery period. Additionally, the report mentions analyzing well logs (including those from oil and gas wells) and referencing earlier studies (e.g., Hiss 1975, Barroll et al. 2004) to support these determinations. Relevant excerpts include: ""Step-drawdown tests were completed to characterize the specific capacity..."", and ""the pumping well was pumped at a constant rate of 31 L/s for 7 days, followed by a recovery period of 23 days. Water levels were monitored... The data were analyzed to estimate transmissivity, hydraulic conductivity, and storativity."" 

Corrected Answer (if needed): N/A","From the locations mentioned (Carlsbad, NM at about 32.4°N, −104.2°W and the Glass Mountains in Texas near roughly 30.3°N, −102.3°W), the best approximate bounding box in decimal degrees is:  
• Western boundary near −104.5°W  
• Eastern boundary near −102.0°W  
• Northern boundary near 32.5°N  
• Southern boundary near 30.0°N  

o3-mini Evaluation:
Correct?: No

Explanation: The report does not provide explicit decimal‐degree coordinates or a defined geographic bounding box. The provided answer relies on approximations for Carlsbad, NM and the Glass Mountains in Texas that are not directly supported by any quoted numbers or figures in the report.

Corrected Answer (if needed): The report describes the study area as extending from near Carlsbad, New Mexico to the Glass Mountains in Texas (see the statement “the portion of the aquifer included in the model domain extends east and south from near Carlsbad, New Mexico, to the Glass Mountains in Texas”) but does not specify a bounding box in decimal degrees. Therefore, based solely on the report, a precise geographic bounding box in decimal degrees cannot be determined.","No dedicated “Future Work” section is provided in the excerpt; however, several directions can be inferred from the testing, modeling, and discussion:

1. Additional Characterization of Geologic Constrictions:  
   • The study identified “submarine canyons”—such as the West Laguna submarine canyon—as zones of reduced permeability that significantly influence drawdown. Future work could focus on more detailed characterization of these constrictions (e.g., using new boreholes or geophysical surveys) to refine aquifer geometry and better capture flow pathways.

2. Enhanced Monitoring of Boundary Conditions and Fluxes:  
   • Because the Capitan aquifer’s interaction with surrounding aquifers (basin aquifers, San Simon Channel, and Sheffield Channel) contributes substantially to the overall flow balance, continued or expanded monitoring of these boundaries could improve the accuracy of predicted fluxes.  
   • Longer-term pumping and recovery data near the Eddy/Lea County line and along each channel boundary would also improve confidence in model-calibrated boundary fluxes.

3. Refined Parameter Estimation for Storativity and Hydraulic Conductivity:  
   • Although the modeling used a conservatively low storativity value, acquiring additional aquifer-test data—especially over varying time scales—would help confirm or refine this choice and reduce uncertainty.  
   • Collecting more hydraulic-conductivity measurements (e.g., via core samples or additional pumping tests) could give a better range of local and regional values, especially in previously under-sampled or geologically complex areas of the aquifer.

4. Long-Term, High-Resolution Monitoring of Drawdown and Recovery:  
   • Since the model includes a 50-year pumping scenario followed by a prolonged rebound period (up to 500 years), gathering actual field observations over the course of pumping and recovery would allow ongoing validation and updates to the model.  
   • Additional data would illuminate any potential changes in aquifer behavior over long timescales and help refine predictive simulations further.

Through these activities, future work would strengthen the confidence in model predictions and improve resource management decisions for the Capitan aquifer.

o3-mini Evaluation:
Correct?: Yes

Explanation: The answer correctly identifies that no explicit “Future Work” section exists in the report and reasonably infers several potential future directions from the testing, modeling, and discussion sections. For example, the answer’s recommendation to further characterize the “submarine canyons,” such as the West Laguna submarine canyon, is supported by the report’s discussion of how these areas influence drawdown. Similarly, the need for enhanced monitoring of fluxes at the aquifer boundaries is inferred from the report’s detailed treatment of flux contributions (e.g., from the basin aquifers and channels), and the suggestion to refine storativity and hydraulic conductivity estimates is aligned with the report’s sensitivity analyses and discussion of conservative parameter choices. The point about long-term monitoring matches the simulation scenarios (50-year pumping and 500-year recovery) described in the text.

Corrected Answer (if needed): No correction is necessary. The inferred recommendations from the report include:
1. Additional characterization of geologic constrictions (e.g., detailed studies of the West Laguna submarine canyon) to better define aquifer geometry.
2. Enhanced monitoring of boundary conditions and fluxes, particularly at the interfaces with basin aquifers and channels, to improve model accuracy.
3. Refined parameter estimation for storativity and hydraulic conductivity through further testing and data collection to reduce uncertainty in the model.
4. Long-term, high-resolution monitoring of drawdown and recovery to validate the 50-year pumping and 500-year rebound simulations.",Catiglia2014_DeepNonPotableWaterSupplyForSOPMineProjectNM.pdf

Corrected Answer (if needed): N/A","Yes. The report characterizes the Capitan Reef as a karstic limestone aquifer (the “reef” and adjacent backreef units of the Artesia Group) and describes its subsurface extent, recharge areas, and zones of cavernous porosity. In doing so, it effectively defines the aquifer’s hydrostratigraphy. The study relies on well‐drilling observations (e.g., “bit drops” indicating open cavities), historical USGS monitoring‐well data, and water‐chemistry analyses (including samples collected by Sandia National Labs) to delineate the reef’s hydrostratigraphic framework.

o3-mini Evaluation:
Correct?: Yes

Explanation: The original answer is correct. The report defines the hydrostratigraphy of the aquifer by characterizing the Capitan Reef as a karstic limestone aquifer (including the reef and equivalent backreef units) and describes its subsurface extent, recharge areas, and zones of cavernous porosity. It specifically mentions evidence from well‐drilling operations (e.g., “bit drops” indicating open cavities), historical USGS monitoring‐well data, and water‐chemistry analyses (with samples from Sandia National Labs) to delineate the framework. For example, the text states: ""Evidence of cavernous porosity and conduit flow is well documented within the Reef aquifer, indicated by blowing wells and bit drops during drilling operations,"" and references the water‐chemistry data provided. 

Corrected Answer (if needed): None needed.","No. The report does not explicitly discuss or map subsurface structural controls (e.g., faults or folds) on groundwater flow. It notes the reef’s general dip and karstic porosity but does not provide specific structural data or an analysis of how structural features might control flow. The focus is instead on water‐chemistry data from a limited number of wells, recharge zones, and the reef’s karst development.

o3-mini Evaluation:
Correct?: Yes

Explanation: The report does not explicitly define subsurface structural controls such as faults or folds on groundwater flow. It only mentions general features like the reef’s dip and its karstic porosity (e.g., “the reef dips into the subsurface” and “evidence of cavernous porosity and conduit flow is well documented”), without providing specific structural data or mapping.

Corrected Answer (if needed): No, the study does not define subsurface structural controls on groundwater flow. It describes the general dip of the reef and notes the development of karstic porosity but offers no explicit discussion or mapping of subsurface structural features related to groundwater flow.","Yes. The report describes recharge occurring where the Capitan limestone (and backreef units) outcrop in the Guadalupe Mountains (most notably in Dark Canyon) and discharge from springs along the Pecos River in Carlsbad. These recharge and discharge zones are identified using well data, spring observations, and previous hydrologic studies (e.g., Bjorklund and Motts, 1959).

o3-mini Evaluation:
Correct?: Yes

Explanation: The report states that recharge occurs where the Capitan limestone (and equivalent backreef units) outcrops—specifically noting recharge during flood events in Dark Canyon in the Guadalupe Mountains—and that groundwater discharges from springs along the Pecos River in Carlsbad. It also cites studies such as Bjorklund and Motts (1959), which supports the identification of these zones.

Corrected Answer (if needed): The report defines recharge as occurring due to direct infiltration into outcropping cavernous zones in the Capitan limestone and backreef units in the Guadalupe Mountains—especially during flood events in Dark Canyon—and identifies discharge through spring flow along the Pecos River in Carlsbad. These zones are characterized based on field observations, well data, and previous hydrologic studies (e.g., Bjorklund and Motts, 1959).","No. The report does not present numerical estimates or measurements of recharge or discharge rates or amounts; it only mentions in general terms where fresh water recharges the aquifer (near the Guadalupe Mountains), but does not quantify those processes.

o3-mini Evaluation:
Correct?: Yes

Explanation: The report does not provide any numerical estimates or measurements for recharge or discharge rates. It only mentions that fresh water is present in the recharge area near the Guadalupe Mountains without quantifying the rates. For example, the report states, ""Fresh water is present in the aquifer only in the immediate vicinity of its recharge area in the Guadalupe Mountains"" but does not include data quantifying recharge or discharge.

Corrected Answer (if needed): No. The report does not quantify recharge and discharge rates or amounts. It only describes where recharge occurs (near the Guadalupe Mountains) without providing specific numerical data.","There is no mention in the excerpts of any water‑level or pressure‑surface maps (such as water‑table elevation, depth‑to‑water, piezometric, or potentiometric surface maps). The sections focus on water‑quality data (e.g., total dissolved solids, specific conductance) rather than water‑level mapping.

o3-mini Evaluation:
Correct?: Yes

Explanation: The report exclusively discusses water‑quality data (for example, total dissolved solids and specific conductance) and the compilation of data into interactive maps, with no mention of any water‑level or pressure‑surface maps such as water‑table elevation, depth‑to‑water, piezometric, or potentiometric surfaces. For instance, the excerpt states, ""the sections focus on water‑quality data"" and only describes water chemistry without referencing maps of the water table or related surfaces.

• Western boundary: ~109.0° W  
• Eastern boundary: ~103.0° W  

o3-mini Evaluation:
Correct?: No

Explanation: The report does not provide explicit decimal degree coordinates or a clearly defined geographic bounding box. The answer approximates New Mexico’s overall state limits rather than reflecting details from the report. In addition, the report focuses on specific aquifers (e.g., the Capitan Reef near Carlsbad and in Lea County) rather than the entire state, so the quoted bounds are not supported by the text.

Corrected Answer (if needed): The report does not include precise decimal degree coordinates defining the study area. It reviews groundwater basins and aquifers in New Mexico—including areas like the Capitan Reef near Carlsbad and parts of Lea County—but no specific geographic bounding box is provided in the text.","Based on the report’s emphasis that large regions of New Mexico are insufficiently characterized and that existing data (largely from shallow, fresh-water supply wells) are not representative of deeper brackish zones, recommended future work would include:

• More comprehensive data collection: Install and sample additional wells (especially in under-studied regions east of the Pecos River and at greater depths) to capture a fuller picture of brackish aquifer conditions and chemistry.  
• Expanded monitoring networks: Revisit and expand historical monitoring programs, including wells that have not been sampled for decades, to allow for up-to-date groundwater-quality assessments.  
• Targeted studies in deeper, brackish intervals: Perform dedicated investigations and sampling in deeper parts of the Capitan Reef (and other aquifers) rather than relying solely on shallow wells.  
• Improved characterization of aquifer properties: Document cavernous porosity, conduit flow pathways, and karst features in greater detail to refine understanding of recharge dynamics and groundwater flow.  
• Regional synthesis: Integrate any new data with existing information from the U.S. Geological Survey, New Mexico Environment Department, and other agencies to create more accurate hydrogeologic models of brackish-water resources.

o3-mini Evaluation:
Correct?: Yes  
Explanation: The answer accurately reflects the report’s emphasis on the limited and unrepresentative nature of the existing data. The report states that “very large regions of New Mexico lack sufficient data” and that “most of the data compiled…are not representative of the brackish water resources” because they come mainly from shallow, public water supply wells. This supports recommendations for more comprehensive data collection, expanded monitoring (especially in under-sampled and deeper zones), targeted studies on brackish intervals, improved characterization of aquifer properties, and a regional synthesis of new and existing information.

Although Hiss had not mapped the base of the reef explicitly, the study team derived it by digitizing Hiss’s maps of the Capitan Reef’s thickness (Figure 11) and top elevation (Figure 12) and then subtracting the thickness from the top elevations to calculate the base elevations for the aquifer. This derived dataset was integrated with other well data to refine the final geodatabase.

o3-mini Evaluation:
Correct?: Yes  
Explanation: The report states that although Hiss did not generate maps of the base, the team derived the base elevations by digitizing Hiss’s figures (Figure 11 for reef thickness and Figure 12 for top elevation) and subtracting the thickness from the top elevations. This derived data, along with additional well data, was used to refine the final geodatabase.

These data were combined—through GIS tools such as TINs and contour shapefiles—to delineate major faults and fracture patterns that influence groundwater movement.","Yes. The report identifies recharge in the Guadalupe Mountains and Patterson Hills (as noted by Hiss, Richey, Sharp, and Uliana) and mentions groundwater flowing to areas such as the Toyah Basin, effectively defining discharge zones. These were delineated using water‐level measurements, structural/ fault mapping, and geologic/topographic information (e.g., uplift, fault zones, and outcrop data) to infer regional flow directions.

o3-mini Evaluation:
Correct?: Yes

Explanation: The report specifies recharge zones in the Guadalupe Mountains and Patterson Hills, and it describes groundwater flow paths based on water‐level measurements and mapping of structural features such as fault zones and outcrops (e.g., Figure 22 is based on work by Hiss, Sharp, and Uliana). These elements—in conjunction with geologic and topographic information indicating uplift and fault-bounded areas—are used to delineate the recharge (Guadalupe Mountains, Patterson Hills) and discharge zones (e.g., flow toward the Toyah Basin).

Instead, it discusses the structural and stratigraphic features (e.g., mapped faults, groundwater flow paths) that affect groundwater flow without directly calculating or measuring recharge and discharge amounts.","Yes. Hiss’s studies (particularly his 1975 dissertation and 1980 work on groundwater movement) include potentiometric‐surface (or similar water‐level) maps for the Capitan aquifer.

o3-mini Evaluation:
Correct?: Yes

Explanation: The report cites Hiss’s 1975 doctoral dissertation (“Stratigraphy and Ground‐Water Hydrology of the Capitan Aquifer…”) and his 1980 work on groundwater movement. These studies are known to include maps showing water‐level information (i.e. potentiometric surfaces or equivalent water table/depth‐to‐water representations). For example, Appendix A notes that project work began by digitizing large structural maps from Hiss’s dissertation, which implies that such water‐level mapping was part of the original studies.

Explanation: The answer correctly states that water‐level data were primarily derived from well records (including geophysical logs, scout tickets, and driller’s reports) from the Hiss (1975) dataset and were supplemented by additional sources such as data from the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, the WIID database from the Texas Water Development Board, and reports from USGS and New Mexico agencies. It also notes that these data were combined with 30‐meter DEM land surface elevations, which is supported by the report text (e.g., “A digital 30‐meter digital elevation model (DEM) was used to assign a land surface elevation to each of Hiss’s well locations…”).

Corrected Answer (if needed): N/A","It appears from the text that the project team did not collect new water‐level measurements in the field; rather, they compiled well and related data (including any available water‐level information) from existing reports, databases, and other external sources.

o3-mini Evaluation:
Correct?: Yes  
Explanation: The report indicates that the team compiled data from existing sources rather than collecting new water-level measurements. For example, it describes digitizing well locations and extracting information from various sources (e.g., geophysical logs, driller’s reports, scout tickets, and published reports) instead of reporting new field measurements.  
Corrected Answer (if needed): It appears from the report that the project team did not collect new water‐level measurements; they compiled well and related data (including any available water‐level information) from existing reports, databases, and other sources.","The text does not mention water chemistry information (major ions, isotopes, pH, salinity, or specific conductance). It focuses on well locations, structural data, aquifer thickness, and geophysical/log data. There is no indication that the study includes or reports detailed water chemistry measurements.

o3-mini Evaluation:
Correct?: Yes

Explanation: The report excerpt makes no mention of water chemistry measurements such as major ions, isotopes, pH, salinity, or specific conductance. It focuses on the digitization of well locations, georeferencing, and the integration of geological and structural data. For instance, the text emphasizes the use of geophysical logs, well picking data, and specifying the aquifer’s thickness rather than reporting chemical water quality measurements.

Corrected Answer (if needed): The study does not include water chemistry data. The report centers on well locations, structural mapping, and data-screening criteria, with no mention of measurements related to water chemistry.","The report sections provided do not specifically mention any new collection of water chemistry data. They focus on geologic and subsurface structural information (well logs, fault mapping, etc.) obtained from previous studies and proprietary sources. Based on these sections alone, any water chemistry data would likely have been compiled from existing sources rather than newly collected for this study.

o3-mini Evaluation:
Correct?: Yes

Explanation: The report only discusses geological data—such as well logs, fault mapping, and subsurface structures—and does not mention any new collection of water chemistry data. For example, it states, ""The team was very selective in choosing which well logs, driller’s reports, and scout tickets to use in this study,"" and describes sourcing data from previous studies (e.g., Hiss, King, Wood), indicating that all data were compiled from existing sources.

Corrected Answer (if needed): Based on the report sections provided, no new water chemistry data were collected. All data appear to have been compiled from previously published and proprietary sources, with the focus solely on geological and subsurface information.","No direct sources of water chemistry data are identified in the excerpt. The text focuses on structural geology, faulting, and the collection of subsurface well data (logs and reports) primarily for delineating the Capitan Reef Complex. Although various water supply reports (e.g., Hendrickson and Jones, 1952; Bjorklund and Motts, 1959; Ogilbee and others, 1962) are mentioned generically as published references, the excerpt does not specify that they—or any other sources—provide water chemistry data.

o3-mini Evaluation:
Correct?: Yes

Explanation: The excerpt does not identify any direct water chemistry data sources. Instead, it centers on structural geology and the compilation of subsurface well data, with only generic mentions of water supply reports (e.g., Hendrickson and Jones, 1952; Bjorklund and Motts, 1959; Ogilbee and others, 1962) that are not specifically tied to water chemistry data. Specifically, the text states: ""Additional key water supply reports include Hendrickson and Jones (1952), Bjorklund and Motts (1959), Ogilbee and others (1962),"" without indicating that these sources provide water chemistry data.

Corrected Answer (if needed): No direct water chemistry data sources are identified in the excerpt. The text focuses on structural geology, faulting, and the collection of subsurface well data for delineating the Capitan Reef Complex, and while it generically cites water supply reports such as Hendrickson and Jones (1952), Bjorklund and Motts (1959), and Ogilbee and others (1962), it does not indicate they provide water chemistry data.","No. The text does not provide explicit values or detailed measurements for properties such as porosity, permeability, storage coefficients, specific storage, specific yield, hydraulic conductivity, or transmissivity. It describes confining and semiconfining behavior in general terms but does not quantify these hydrogeologic properties.

o3-mini Evaluation:
Correct?: Yes

Explanation: The report lacks explicit numerical values or detailed measurements of porosity, permeability, storage coefficients, specific storage, specific yield, hydraulic conductivity, or transmissivity. Instead, it only describes general hydrogeologic behavior (e.g., confining, semiconfining, or good hydraulic communication) without quantification.

Corrected Answer (if needed): No, the study does not report any specific numerical hydrogeologic properties such as porosity, permeability, storage coefficients, specific storage, specific yield, hydraulic conductivity, or transmissivity. Instead, it only provides general descriptions of how various lithologic units behave in terms of hydraulic communication (e.g., “generally not considered a confining unit” or “can be generally considered as semiconfining”).","N/A. No specific hydrogeologic properties and their determination methods are described in this section.

o3-mini Evaluation:
Correct?: Yes

Explanation: The section provided focuses on data capture, georeferencing, and mapping methodologies and does not describe any specific hydrogeologic properties or the methods used to determine them. For example, the text explains how data points were digitized, verified, and assigned accuracy values, and how DEM data were used for elevation extraction, but it does not include any measurement or determination of hydrogeologic properties.

Corrected Answer (if needed): N/A","The report does not provide explicit bounding coordinates, but based on the counties and features mentioned (e.g., Eddy County in southeastern New Mexico through Ward and Winkler Counties in west Texas), a reasonable approximation is that the study area extends roughly from about 31°N to 33.5°N latitude and from about 106°W to 102°W longitude.

o3-mini Evaluation:
Correct?: No

Explanation: The report does not provide explicit decimal degree boundaries for the study area. The answer’s approximation based on counties and features (e.g., “31°N to 33.5°N” and “106°W to 102°W”) is not directly supported by any specific text or quoted bounding box within the report.

Corrected Answer (if needed): The report does not explicitly state the geographic bounding box in decimal degrees. Instead, it mentions various counties and features (such as parts of trans‐Pecos Texas, the Capitan Aquifer, and nearby areas in southeastern New Mexico), but no specific latitude and longitude limits are provided.","Based on the project’s stated purpose—constructing a geologic framework to support future groundwater modeling—the next logical steps include:  
• Developing and calibrating a groundwater availability model (GAM) that uses the newly compiled structural surfaces, thickness grids, and aquifer boundaries.  
• Collecting additional well and geophysical data (including newly drilled wells, water-level measurements, and updated formation logs) to refine the structural contours and thickness maps, especially in areas with limited control.  
• Confirming fault locations and potential hydraulic barriers or conduits by integrating more detailed seismic or subsurface data.  
• Evaluating potential connectivity between the Capitan Reef Complex and adjacent formations, particularly where rapid facies changes occur, to better define lateral groundwater flow.  
• Incorporating up-to-date water quality and well yield data to link the geologic framework with aquifer performance and to help prioritize any data gaps before full model development.  

o3-mini Evaluation:
Correct?: No

Explanation: The provided answer is a reasonable extrapolation based on the project’s purpose but does not directly reflect explicit future work recommendations stated in the report. The report text mainly describes the construction of a geologic framework to support a future groundwater availability model (GAM) and does not lay out detailed “future work” bullet‐points such as additional data types (e.g., water quality, well-yield measurements) or explicit recommendations for confirming faults with seismic surveys. Thus, the answer introduces steps (e.g., integrating water quality data or “updating” fault confirmations) that are not clearly specified in the report excerpt.

Corrected Answer (if needed): The report indicates that the next steps should involve:
• Using the newly compiled GIS geodatabase and geologic framework (including top and base elevation grids and thickness maps of the Capitan Reef Complex) to develop and ultimately calibrate a groundwater availability model (GAM).
• Refining the structural and stratigraphic framework by integrating additional subsurface information (e.g., more geophysical logs and well records) in areas where data are sparse.
• Further delineating and confirming structural features—such as faults and hydraulic barriers—in order to better understand their influence on groundwater flow.
While the report does not explicitly list these as “future work recommendations,” the intent is clear in sections like the Executive Summary and Introduction, where it states that the geologic framework is intended to serve as the foundation for future groundwater modeling work.",Standen2009_CapitanReefComplex_Framework_finalwErrata.pdf
