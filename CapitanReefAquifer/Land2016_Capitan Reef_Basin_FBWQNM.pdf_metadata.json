Where are the brackish water resources? What data are available? What exactly is the water chemistry? How feasible is it to use brackish water for public supply? With funding from the New Mexico Environment Department, Drinking Water Bureau (related to Source Water Protection), the New Mexico Bureau of Geology, Aquifer Mapping Program, has compiled a number of water quality resources and data. These data were derived from the Aquifer Mapping Program, digitized historical water reports, the U.S. Geological Survey, and the New Mexico Environment Department. All pub- licly available data are now on an interactive map found here, under Water Resources: geoinfo.nmt.edu/maps. For an analysis and review of the compiled water quality data, we have attempted to assess the brackish water resources in the state of New Mexico in a regional approach. It is apparent that very large regions of New Mexico lack suf\ufb01cient data to assess the brackish water resources. Most of the data compiled in this review are from existing water supply wells, and therefore are not representative of the brackish water resources. These data also represent, in general, the shallowest parts of the aquifers where water wells are commonly completed. Each of the regions of assessment shown on the map are provided in individual chapters for quick review. These chapters are part of a larger technical report is available from the New Mexico Bureau of Geology and Mineral Resources at: geoinfo.nmt.edu/publications/open\ufb01le/home.cfml.

In New Mexico, the reef serves as the host rock for the Big Room in Carlsbad Cavern. A few miles northeast of Carlsbad Caverns National Park, the reef dips into the subsurface and passes beneath the city of Carlsbad, where it forms a karstic aquifer that is the principal source of fresh water for that community (Land and Burger, 2008). The Capitan Reef continues in the subsurface east and south into Lea County, then south for ~150 miles to its southeasternmost outcrop in the Glass Mountains of west Texas. Recharge to the Reef Aquifer occurs by direct in\ufb01ltration into outcropping cavernous zones formed in the Capitan limestone and equivalent backreef units of the Artesia Group. A signi\ufb01cant component of this recharge occurs during \ufb02ood events in Dark Canyon in the Guadalupe Mountains, where the reef crops out in the bed of Dark Canyon arroyo. Groundwater \ufb02ows northeastward through the reef and discharges from springs along the Pecos River within the city of Carlsbad (Bjorklund and Motts, 1959). Evidence of cavernous porosity and conduit \ufb02ow is well documented within the Reef aquifer, indicated by blowing wells and bit drops during drilling operations; and by the presence of water in channels and cavities at different horizons within the reef (Hendrickson and Jones, 1952; Motts, 1968). Carlsbad Cavern may thus be thought of as an upper end-mem- ber example of cavernous porosity development within the Capitan Formation (Land and Burger, 2008).

We have chosen not to plot TDS and speci\ufb01c conduc- tance vs. depth for the Capitan Reef because the lateral distribution of dissolved solids most accurately charac- terizes the distribution of salinity within this aquifer. Brackish water resources are clearly available in the Capitan Reef aquifer, although for the most part that water is more accurately described as a brine, and would thus not be suitable for conventional desalination technologies. However, this highly saline water is a valuable resource for industrial applications in southeastern New Mexico and west Texas. Both the petroleum and potash mining industries have recently expressed inter- est in exploiting brackish water in the reef aquifer for water \ufb02ooding of mature oil \ufb01elds in the Permian Basin region and for processing of potash ore.
