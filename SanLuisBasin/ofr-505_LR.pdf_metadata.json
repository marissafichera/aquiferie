Distribution of the geologic and hydrostratigraphic units is presented through geologic maps and seven detailed cross sec- tions that depict the distribution of geologic and hydrostratigraphic units, well data, surface water features, water levels, faults, and zones of fracturing and sediment layers in volcanic rocks. Cross sections are constructed both parallel and perpendicular to regional ground water flow and illustrate aquifers in the context of the geo- logic framework, the Rio Grande and the Rio Hondo, local acequias and other surface water features. Ground water exists primarily within the Quaternary-Tertiary alluvial fan sediments known as the Blueberry Hill deposit, the Servil- leta Formation basalts and interbedded sedi- ments, the lower Tertiary Chamita Formation of the Santa Fe Group, and locally within the Cerro Negro dacite. A shallow alluvial aquifer in the Blueberry Hill alluvial fan deposit is lim- ited to an area south of the Rio Hondo and east of the Airport fault. This aquifer is semi-perched on the Cerro Negro dacite, a massive, crystal- line volcanic unit with relatively low regional permeability, and is recharged primarily through local irrigation return flow. A shallow perched aquifer also exists in the alluvial fan deposits north of the Rio Hondo, on the southwest flank of Cerro Negro. Here, perched ground water ac- cumulates on the Cerro Negro dacite, recharges from Acequia de Atalaya, and discharges from the Medina spring, and possibly the lower Rio Hondo springs. The Cerro Negro dacite contains localized, productive aquifers in fractured and rubble EXECUTIVE SUMMARY zones but generally appears to behave as a perch- ing bed for shallow alluvial aquifers. Static water levels are highly variable, regionally inconsistent, and significantly lower than those measured in overlying perched or shallow alluvial aquifers. It is likely that fractured aquifers in the Cerro Negro dacite are highly compartmentalized, and have only limited or partial interconnection with adjacent aquifers. The Servilleta Formation, named the deep volcanic-alluvial aquifer in this study, contains productive zones in thin basalts and sediments west of the Airport fault. A uniform hydraulic gradient between the Airport fault and the Rio Grande suggests that ground water moves easily between and through the interlayered basalts and sediments. This regional potentiometric surface grades westward to the elevation of cool springs that emerge in the Rio Grande gorge. Due to limited data and variable, regionally inconsistent water levels in deep wells east of the Airport fault, it is uncertain whether this deep aquifer system underlies the entire study area or if"

Due to limited data and variable, regionally inconsistent water levels in deep wells east of the Airport fault, it is uncertain whether this deep aquifer system underlies the entire study area or if it includes the Cerro Negro dacite. A transition zone between shallow and deep aquifers occurs at the Airport fault, which defines the western limits of the Cerro Negro dacite and the shallow alluvial aquifer. A vertical head differential of more than 300 feet exists across the Airport fault, which forms a high-permeability zone with a strong, local downward gradient. At the fault, shallow water levels rapidly merge with those in deep volcanic-alluvial wells on the west side of the fault, implying downward leakage from shallow to deep aquifers. Relatively young recharge ages in springs discharging in the Rio Grande gorge from the deep volcanic-alluvial aquifer suggest that shallow alluvial ground water merging NEW MEXICO BUREAU OF GEOLOGY AND MINERAL RESOURCES 2 with the deep aquifer at the Airport fault transi- tion zone comprises a significant portion of the ground water discharging at the springs. The Rio Hondo is part of a stream-connected aquifer system with gaining, neutral and losing reaches controlled by the permeability of con- tiguous, underlying geologic units. The alluvial deposits along the Rio Hondo were probably above the water table under natural conditions, but now have locally perched or semi-perched aquifers due to the development of irrigation. In the Rio Hondo drainage, accretion of ground water from surface water and irrigation recharge is a critical factor controlling the extent of the shallow alluvial aquifer. Because of interconnec- tions between the Rio Hondo, the Rio Grande and shallow and deep aquifers, depletions of ground water from these aquifers have the very real potential of contributing to surface water depletions in a matter of decades or less. Simi- larly, reductions in irrigation would have nega- tive effects on ground water levels in the shallow alluvial aquifer. ARROYO HONDO 3 Background Taos County is the northernmost county along the Rio Grande in New Mexico. As such, it plays an important role in the hydrologic condition of the Rio Grande and a critical role in the admin- istration of water within the Rio Grande ground water basin. The population of Taos County has increased steadily since 1960, with rapid growth and home construction in the Arroyo Hondo region, including the neighborhoods of Arroyo Hondo, Hondo Mesa, and Stagecoach. Since 2000, Arroyo Hondo has experienced a popula- tion growth of 8.2 percent, to a population of about 2400 people in 2007. Most new develop- ment requires the installation of domestic water wells and septic tanks. Recently, there has been public concern about the vulnerability of shal- low domestic wells to extended drought, and the potential future impacts of increased ground wa- ter pumping on domestic wells, down-gradient springs in the Rio Grande gorge, the Rio Hondo and Rio Grande, and acequias. Because most shallow ground water in the Taos region ultimately flows to the Rio Grande, consumption of ground water eventually results in depletions to the river flow (Burck et al. 2004, Shomaker and Johnson 2005). Approximately 98 percent of all water withdrawn in the Taos region in 2000 was used for irrigation. How- ever, 61 percent of that water was returned to streams, resulting in an average annual net deple- tion of approximately 40,000 acre-feet of water. As growth and development increase, accompa- nied by installation of more domestic wells, this net depletion is expected to increase. The Taos Regional Water Plan (Daniel B. Stephens & Assoc., 2006), adopted by the New Mexico Interstate Stream Commission in July 2008, lists the following as key water issues fac- ing the Taos region: \u2022 Rio Grande Compact and availability of water rights \u2022 Drought vulnerability \u2022 Infrastructure needs \u2022 Water quality \u2022 Public education \u2022 Protection of agriculture \u2022 Protection of water rights \u2022 Planning for growth \u2022 Watershed protection \u2022 Data gaps The hydrogeologic data, interpretations and conceptual model of ground water flow pre- sented here can aid in management of the water resources of the Arroyo Hondo area. This report is the most thorough assessment to date of the ground water system in the Arroyo Hondo area, and can support state, county, and local officials and private citizens who make decisions related to water resources. Previous Work Studies of the geology of the Taos region have been reported in a variety of formats. A set of geologic quadrangle maps has recently been produced by the New Mexico Bureau of Geology & Mineral Resources (http://geoinfo.nmt.edu/ publications/maps/geologic/ofgm/home.html), including recent maps of the Arroyo Hondo, Guadalupe Mountain, Taos, and Los Cordovas quadrangles (Fig. 1). A great variety of geologic and hydrogeologic topics are covered in the 2004 New Mexico Geological Society Guide- book (Brister et al., 2004), and by references therein.

Stephens and Assoc., 2006). Our current understanding of the geology of the Arroyo Hondo area is based on the modern geologic quadrangle maps (Bauer and Kelson, 2001; Kelson and Bauer, 2003, 2006, and 2008), and many earlier studies of the Taos Pla- teau and southern Sangre de Cristo Mountains. This report provides the first comprehensive synthesis of geologic and geophysical data and subsurface geologic interpretations. Modern investigations of the hydrogeology of the Arroyo Hondo region are few. Bauer et al. (1999) assessed the hydrogeology of the region south of Taos. Drakos et al. (2004a and 2004b) studied the hydrologic characteristics of the aqui- fers and the geochemistry of the surface water and ground water in the Taos region. Rawling (2005) performed a hydrogeologic investigation of the Ar- royo Seco area, just east of our study area. Purpose and Scope The objective of this work was to characterize and interpret the three-dimensional geology and hydrogeology of the greater Arroyo Hondo area, as a westward extension of the hydrogeologic as- sessment of the Arroyo Seco area (Rawling, 2005). Our work shows the profound effect that geologic features have on the ground water system, and allows us to better understand the distribution of ground water and its flow patterns, and to evalu- ate the interactions of ground water and surface Figure 1\u2212Location Map for Arroyo Hondo study area.

The study area focused on the region of high population growth along both sides of the lower Rio Hondo, and the Rio Grande gorge. Because of the new digital geologic map of the Arroyo Hondo quadrangle (Kelson and Bau- er, 2006), no new geologic mapping was needed for this study. Instead, the focus of this report was to compile existing hydrologic and geologic data, measure water levels from domestic wells, draw cross sections and hydrogeologic maps, in- terpret existing aeromagnetic data, and propose a conceptual model of ground water flow and geologic controls. This work was conducted by staff and contractors of the New Mexico Bureau of Geology & Mineral Resources (a division of New Mexico Tech) in Socorro, New Mexico between October 2005 and July 2007. The work was funded, in part, by Taos County through a grant from the Healy Foundation. The report contains maps of the geology, aeromagnetic data, water well locations, surface drainages and acequias, hydrogeologic condi- tions and domains, and a regional potentiometric surface. It also contains tables of water levels, data compiled from water wells used in the investigation, copies of all the well records used in the study, and a summary of hydrogeologic units. These data were used to construct seven detailed geologic cross sections, which were com- bined with hydrologic information to develop a conceptual hydrogeologic model of the ground water flow system. Description of Study Area The village of Arroyo Hondo is located in the Rio Hondo valley, 10 miles northwest of Taos (Fig. 1). The study area (28 square miles) strad- dles the western half of the Rio Hondo drainage, and includes the Arroyo Hondo neighborhood, the western edges of the Arroyo Seco/Valdez and Lower Des Montes neighborhoods, the north- ern parts of the Hondo Mesa and Stagecoach neighborhoods and Taos Pueblo Tract B, and the Rio Grande gorge, including the east and west rims (Fig. 2). North of the Hondo valley is a topographi- cally high Pliocene volcano known as Cerro Ne- gro. Between Cerro Negro and the Rio Grande is a high, dissected landscape of sand and gravel deposits. South of the Hondo valley is Hondo Mesa, a relatively flat, high, sandy alluvial plateau. In the southwestern study area are the Stagecoach hills, a topographically high cluster of ridges and hills that represent an erosional remnant of an older alluvial plateau. The Rio Hondo, one of three perennial Rio Grande tributaries in Taos County, drains 75 square miles including the northwest por- tion of Wheeler Peak and the southern Taos Mountains. Elevations in the drainage range from over 13,000 ft at Wheeler Peak to 6470 ft at the Rio Grande. As it flows west, its canyon steadily deepens to the confluence with the Rio Grande where it is incised about 400 feet. In the western part of the study area, the Rio Grande flows south through a deep, narrow canyon cut in basalts and gravels of the Taos Plateau volca- nic field. (Fig. 3) Surface drainages south of the Hondo valley on Hondo Mesa and the alluvial plateau are poorly developed, disconnected from mountain recharge, and only carry runoff dur- ing local storm events. A dozen or more acequias divert surface water from the Rio Hondo, upper Arroyo Seco, and upper Rio Lucero to irrigate about 3000 acres in the Arroyo Hondo area (Johnson, 1998).

METHODOLOGY Water Levels A major component of this study was measur- ing water levels in a representative population of domestic water wells in the Arroyo Hondo area. Between December 2005 and May 2006, water level measurements were made in 56 wells using a 500\u2013foot steel tape for pump-equipped wells, and a 650\u2013foot electric meter for clear wells. Measurements were made to a repeatable ac- curacy of 0.01 feet. In cases where a water level could not be reproduced with this accuracy, the water level from the New Mexico Office of the State Engineer (NMOSE) well record was used. The wells were field located with a handheld GPS device. In addition to the measured wells, 54 other water wells previously inventoried by the Taos Soil & Water Conservation District (TSWCD) during their Taos County water well inventory (Benson, 2004) are included with pub- lished well ID names and located with published coordinates. These wells were used to add sub- surface geologic and hydrologic control. All well records were evaluated for quality control. In all cases, well depth, water level, and screen interval were compiled from original OSE well records. Although the GPS locations recorded by TSWCD staff are considered to be accurate, the depth-to-water entries from well records are considered to be approximate. Eleva- tions of wells and springs were calculated in ArcGIS using the 10\u2013meter DEM coverage and GPS-derived coordinates. Well data are compiled in Table A1 (Appendix A), a well inventory map is shown in Figure 4, and original well records are attached in Appendix A. Measured versus Recorded Water Levels\u2013Many of our measured water levels differed significant- ly from those recorded by drillers on NMOSE well records (Table A1). In the 48 wells that yielded precise water levels, the discrepancies with the recorded level ranged from -107 feet (measured level was lower than recorded level) to +143 feet (measured level was higher than re- corded level). Water levels in 19 of the measured wells differed by more than 30 feet with those noted on the well record. Possible reasons for these discrepancies include seasonal variations in water levels, long-term water level changes reflecting the difference in recharge between wet and dry cycles, or inaccurate measurement or re- cording by the well driller. The latter may be due to measuring the water level before a static water level was reached in the newly drilled wells. There are no obvious geographic patterns in the variations between water levels measured in this study and those recorded by the well drillers. Water Level Contouring\u2013ArcGIS software was used to plot the well locations and water level measurements. Ground water elevation contours were drawn by hand and then digitized. Inherent in the contouring of regional water level mea- surements are the assumptions that ground water flow is horizontal, the measurements are from a single aquifer, and that hydraulic head does not vary with depth. In general, these assumptions were not met by the regional water-level data from Arroyo Hondo. A significant potentiomet- ric head difference of about 400 feet differenti- ates \u201cshallow\u201d and \u201cdeep\u201d wells. Wells complet- ed above and below this depth show significant differences in both hydrostratigraphic unit and ground water elevation. Because there appear to be two aquifer systems, we depict both a shallow water table surface and a deeper potentiometric surface that represent two separate aquifers. ARROYO HONDO 9 Where there is hydrologic or geologic evi- dence of a connection between the shallow aqui- fer and the Rio Hondo, the water table contours cross the stream channel at upstream or down- stream angles depending on whether evidence suggests the stream is gaining or losing, respec- tively. In two short reaches of the Rio Hondo, geologic and hydrologic evidence suggests that the stream is disconnected from the shallow allu- vial aquifer and the water table contour is drawn perpendicular to the boundary. It is important to note that water level eleva- tions herein are from wells with screened inter- vals varying from tens to hundreds of feet, and are not point measurements of hydraulic head. The water level elevations therefore represent a vertical average of the hydraulic head over some aquifer interval rather than at a discrete point in the aquifer. With these facts, and the variation in data quality, in mind, the contours were con- trolled primarily by measured water levels rather than recorded and were not forced to fit every water level elevation. Contours are dashed where approximate and queried where inferred. Geologic Map The Arroyo Hondo geologic map used in this study (Kelson and Bauer, 2006) is part of a new digital, open-file 7.5\u2013minute quadrangle map created in 2005 and 2006 through the New Mexico Bureau of Geology & Mineral Resources STATEMAP Program. The study area encom- passes most of the southern half of the map. Although the map distinguishes between the Servilleta Formation basalts, the Cerro Negro dacites, and other Tertiary volcanic units, it does not show the individual flow units of the Servilleta Formation, nor does it differentiate other volcanic flows that are exposed in the Rio Grande gorge.

Geologic map unit descriptions for the Arroyo Hondo study area are described in Appendix B. Geologic Cross Sections We created seven new hydrogeologic cross sec- tions for this study. The locations of sections were chosen to optimize hydrogeologic insights while maximizing the number of measured wells that could be incorporated into the section lines. The topographic profiles were generated by ArcGIS software. All cross section lines are straight and vertically exaggerated by a factor of five to better illustrate hydrologic and geologic details. Wells located within about 500 ft of the lines were orthogonally projected onto the cross sections, and labeled as \u201cProjected\u201d. On the cross sections, lithologic picks of volcanic rock versus sediment at each well were made using the lithologic logs on the NMOSE well records. The volcanic intervals were used as approximate guides for drawing the geologic units. In some cases, it was clear that the driller had generalized the minor lithologic variations encountered in the hole. No lithologic log dif- ferentiated between Servilleta Formation basalt and Cerro Negro dacite. The depictions of these two units on the cross sections are based on: 1) the geologic map (Kelson and Bauer, 2006); 2) drawings of the geology of the walls of the Rio Grande gorge (Peterson, 1981); 3) high-reso- lution aeromagnetic data that can help discern buried rock types and faults (T. Grauch, personal communication, 2006); and 4) an understand- ing of the volcanic and sedimentary systems and geologic processes of the area. On the three cross sections that cross the Rio Grande gorge, the geologic units shown in the gorge were adapted from the work of Peterson (1981). The screened (perforated) intervals of the wells shown on the cross sections were retrieved from the well records. In nearly all cases, the static water level is above the top of the screen, although in a few wells the screen is either par- tially or entirely above the water level. One well (RG-46180) is apparently unscreened. Several measured wells are of unknown construction, as the well records are not available.

GEOLOGIC SETTING Regional Geology The study area lies within the southern San Luis Basin, the northernmost basin of the Rio Grande rift (Fig. 1). The 150-mile-long San Luis Basin is bordered by the Sangre de Cristo Mountains on the east and the Tusas and San Juan Moun- tains on the west. The basin is roughly divided into two physiographic provinces, the broad San Luis Valley of southern Colorado and the nar- row Taos Plateau of northern New Mexico. The divide between the two consists of a prominent zone of volcanoes stretching west from Questa (Fig. 5). At the southern end of the basin, near Taos, the rift is about 20 miles wide and filled with about a 3-mile-thick section of sediments and volcanic rocks. Upon exiting the San Juan Mountains, the Rio Grande turns southward, transects the San Luis Basin, and flows southward through suc- cessive rift basins towards the Gulf of Mexico. The river itself did not excavate the rift. Rather, the river follows the topographically lowest part of the rift, carving several spectacular canyons along the way. Beginning in southern Colorado, the Rio Grande has cut a steep-walled canyon, known as the Rio Grande gorge, into the basalt cap rock. The gorge deepens southward to a maximum of 850 feet at the Wild Rivers Rec- reation Area near Questa, and then gradually shallows as the Rio Grande flows through the southern San Luis Basin and into the Espa\u00f1ola Basin. Unlike the rift basins to the south, the San Luis Basin is relatively undissected. That is, the sedimentary material that fills the basin has not yet been extensively exposed by the action of riv- ers and streams. Instead, the Rio Grande and its major tributaries have cut deep, narrow canyons through the volcanic rocks that cap most of the Taos Plateau. The river canyons provide the only good exposures of the rocks in the basin, which in the Taos area consist of Tertiary volca- nic rocks interbedded with poorly consolidated sand-gravel-clay deposits. A single type of volcanic rock dominates the Taos Plateau landscape\u2014the olivine tholeiite ba- salts of the Servilleta Formation. The gorge walls chiefly consist of thin, near-horizontal layers of this dark-gray, pahoehoe (ropy), vesicular (with small air pockets) lava. Much of the basalt was erupted from a cluster of low-relief shield volca- noes near Tres Piedras, traveling as thin, molten sheets for tens of miles before solidifying. Over 600 feet of basalt were locally stacked up dur- ing about 2 million years of episodic eruptions, between about 4.8 and 2.8 million years ago. These rocks can be seen from any location along the gorge, but are especially well exposed near the Rio Grande Gorge Bridge. The second type of volcanic rock in the Ar- royo Hondo area is found on the Cerro Negro volcano, a dacite lava dome (lava cone or vol- canic dome) that was formed by eruptions of sticky lava that could only flow short distances before solidifying (Figs. 7 and 9). The lava piles over and around the vent, and commonly ex- pands from within, forming steep-sided domes with lava rubble covering the surface. Domes can be active from decades to centuries. Most of the large volcanoes on the Taos Plateau are lava domes. Although some of the sediment that fills the rift basin was deposited by the Rio"

An alluvial fan begins to form where a rapidly mov- ing mountain stream flows out onto a relatively flat valley floor. As the stream loses velocity, the coarser sedimentary material is dropped by the stream. This material forms an \u201capron\u201d that radiates out from the point where the mountain stream enters the valley. Over time, each alluvial fan is buried under successively younger alluvium as the basin slowly sinks. In the Rio Grande rift, these rift-fill de- posits are called the Santa Fe Group. Over much of the basin, we can only see the youngest basin fill at the surface. However, glimpses of Santa Fe Group sediments exist in the gorge, commonly as red or tan layers sandwiched between basalt or dacite lava flows in the gorge walls. The youngest of these alluvial fans and ancestral Rio Grande river deposits overlie the Servilleta basalts and lo- cally comprise the area\u2019s shallow aquifers. Geology of the Arroyo Hondo Area Volcanic Rocks\u2013The study area contains well- exposed Servilleta Formation in the Rio Grande gorge and in the western Rio Hondo canyon (Fig. 7). In the gorge, the basalts have been sub divided into four major flow units (Peterson, 1981). From oldest to youngest they are the lower Servilleta Basalt (Tb1 & Tb2), middle Servilleta Basalt (Tb3), and upper Servilleta Basalt (Tb4). All exposed basalts are extensively fractured, especially by columnar joints that tend to vertically penetrate entire basalt flows (Fig. 8). Many of the columnar fractures are open. Such basalt fracturing formed as each lava flow cooled, thus we expect the buried basalt units to also be extensively fractured, and therefore exceedingly permeable in the vertical dimen- sion. In addition, the flow tops are typically characterized by highly vesicular ropy structures that create porous and permeable horizontal zones between flows. Over much of the Arroyo Hondo area, the top of the Servilleta Forma- tion has been eroded so that the thickness of Tb4 is inconsistent. In addition, basalt flows, as ARROYO HONDO 15 well as the major flow units, are locally laterally discontinuous. The discontinuity, variable thick- ness, and monolithic nature of these basalts make them poor stratigraphic markers, which cannot be convincingly correlated in the subsurface using well data alone. A second variety of basalt is exposed in the lower cliffs near the Rio Hondo and Rio Grande confluence. This \u201csilicic alkali basalt\u201d (Lipman and Mehnert, 1979) is a relatively rare eruptive product of the Taos Plateau volcanic field, and differs from the Servilleta Basalt by subtle varia- tions in chemistry and mineralogy. The outcrop exposure of silicic alkali basalt in the study area is characterized by thick flows, brecciated aa mar- gins (aa describes a more viscous lava flow whose surface is covered by thick, jumbled piles of loose, sharp blocks), and radial fracture patterns in the massive interiors of the flow lobes. The source vent for these flows is unknown, but must be nearby. The Cerro Negro dacite volcano is composed of many, perhaps hundreds, of small lava flows, which have collectively built the volcanic edifice. The volcano certainly contains multiple vents, and is therefore enormously complex in three dimensions. Although each dacite flow is com- posed of relatively dense, fine-grained rock that generally lacks porosity, they do contain extensive fractures and rubble zones around their perim- eters. Columnar joints are pervasive in thinner flows (Fig. 9). In addition, the dacite flows are generally mantled by extremely fractured rubble zones that formed as the lava cooled. Cerro Ne- gro therefore contains a vast three-dimensional network of high porosity and permeability zones intermingled with dense, low- or zero-permeabili- ty zones. Based on lithologic data from well logs, we estimate that the entire complex of multiple dacite flows is typically several hundred feet thick, but ranges from over 1000 feet north of the Rio Hondo to a few hundred feet thick beneath Hondo Mesa. Preliminary interpretation of high- resolution aeromagnetic data (Fig. 10, T. Grauch, personal communication, 2006) and lithologic logs from well records indicate that the Cerro Ne- gro volcano is partially buried by alluvial deposits such that the top of the dacite dips southward and westward under the study area, and the dac- ite flows are"

At least one Cerro Negro dacite flow is exposed in the Rio Grande gorge, just upstream from the Rio Hondo confluence. Sedimentary Deposits\u2013The sedimentary depos- its in the study area can be roughly divided into three horizontal zones: 1) deep sedimentary deposits that are stratigraphically below the old- est Servilleta Formation basalt (i.e., older than about 5 million years); 2) intermediate-depth sediments that are interbedded with the Servil- leta Formation basalt units (i.e., between about 5 and 2.8 million years); and 3) shallow sediments that rest above the Servilleta Formation basalts (i.e., younger than about 2.8 million years). In all three zones, the sedimentary layers contain extensive vertical and horizontal compositional and textural variations due to the complex depo- sitional environment along the edge of an active rift basin (Fig. 11). The characteristics of the deep sedimentary deposits are not well known, as they are not exposed in the basin, and only a few deep wells south of the study area have penetrated them. They probably belong to the lower Chamita and Tesuque Formations of the Santa Fe Group. These lower Santa Fe Group alluvial deposits are composed of well-consolidated layers of clay, silt, sand, gravel, and cobbles. Some of the intrabasalt sediments are ex- posed in the Rio Grande gorge. In general, these deposits are layered alluvial fan and fluvial de- posits that are dominated by clay, silt, sand, and pebble- to cobble-sized clasts of Tertiary volcanic and Proterozoic metamorphic rock. Typically, these deposits are altered to a brick red color where overlain by basalt flows (Fig. 12). The shallow sedimentary deposits are well exposed over much of the study area. They range in age from the thick Quaternary-Tertiary Blue- berry Hill alluvial fan deposit (QTbh), exposed south of the Rio Hondo canyon, and its north- ern equivalent (QTg), to the thinner alluvial fan NEW MEXICO BUREAU OF GEOLOGY AND MINERAL RESOURCES 16 Figure 10\u2212High-resolution aeromagnetic map of the Arroyo Hondo region.

Note the wide range of grain sizes and compositions of these layered units. Figure 12\u2212Photograph of the base of a Servilleta Formation basalt flow in the Rio Grande gorge. The underlying, orange- colored, silty sediments were baked by the molten lava flow. (Qf1) and the numerous fluvial terrace deposits of the Rio Grande and Rio Hondo, and mod- ern alluvium (Qal). Although the Quaternary deposits cover most of the map area (Fig. 7), collectively they comprise a thin mantle over the older deposits and volcanic units. Depending on local thickness, the permeability of the underly- ing unit, and the presence of local recharge, these young alluvial deposits can form important local aquifers, as in the case of the Blueberry Hill al- luvial deposit near Arroyo Hondo. Faults\u2013Two mappable faults exist in the study area. The Dunn fault (Peterson, 1981; Dungan et al., 1984; Kelson and Bauer, 2006) is an east- dipping, east-down rift fault that parallels the Rio Grande gorge in the western study area. It exhibits about 115 feet of normal movement that appears to coincide in time with eruption of Servilleta Formation basalts and interlayered sediments, as Dungan et al. (1984) reported that the sedimentary interval between Tb2 and Tb3 is 56 feet thicker than the same interval west of the fault. In addition, the basalt flows east of the fault are all underlain by baked zones, indicat- ing that the basalts covered wetlands or stand- ing water. No such baked zones are found west of the fault. Where exposed west of the Dunn Bridge, the Dunn fault consists of a several- meter-wide brittle deformational zone that is characterized by brecciated basalt and fractured and altered sediments. The second fault in the study area, the Airport fault, is not exposed, but is projected through the Hondo Mesa area from geologic mapping to the south (Kelson and Bauer, 2003) where it connects to a well-exposed segment of the Los Cordovas fault system. In the northern Los Cordovas and southernmost Arroyo Hondo quadrangles, the fault appears as a remarkably straight photolinear. Based on our interpreta- tion of lithologic logs from well records, the Airport fault is an east-down normal rift fault that offsets basalts approximately 100 feet below Hondo Mesa (Fig. 13a, cross sections A\u2013A\u2019 and B\u2013B\u2019). Similar to the Dunn fault, the Airport fault may be responsible for thickness changes of units across the fault and appears to cause significant westward thinning of the Blueberry Hill alluvial fan deposit (QTbh).

A compara- tive summary of data and aquifer descriptions from the various studies is presented in Table 1 (pg.26). A brief discussion of the major find- ings and interpretations from previous work is provided below. Drakos et al. (2004a) developed a regionally sig- nificant geohydrologic framework for the Taos Valley. They identified two major aquifers in the Taos area, a shallow aquifer that includes the Servilleta Formation and younger alluvial depos- its, and a deep aquifer of the Tertiary-age Santa Fe Group sedimentary units such as the Tesuque and Picuris Formations. The shallow aquifer was comprised of three geologic units: 1) Quaternary alluvium (Qal) and other surfi- cial deposits (unconfined alluvium); 2) Older alluvium and the Blueberry Hill de- posit and equivalent units (leaky-confined alluvium); 3) The Servilleta Formation upper and mid- dle basalts and the intervening sediment (named the Agua Azul aquifer). The Servilleta Formation lower basalt and underlying Chamita Formation (also known as Cieneguilla Formation) may be transitional between the shallow aquifer and the deep, leaky- confined and confined aquifer. In the Arroyo Seco area, they detected a downward vertical gradient in the shallow aquifer system. Based on a potentiometric map, they also noted that the upper Rio Hondo is a gaining stream, whereas the lower Rio Hondo is a losing reach. They reported that faults do not act as impermeable boundaries in the shallow alluvial aquifer, but may in the deep basin-fill aquifer. Rawling (2005) investigated the Arroyo Seco area just to the east of our study area, using a detailed geologic map, geologic and hydrologic data from OSE well records, and measured water levels. He concluded the following: 1) Ground water flows generally westward, but flow paths are complicated by mountain- front faults, transmissivity variations, and interactions with streams. 2) The Sangre de Cristo fault has a notice- able affect on ground water flow patterns, producing both steep horizontal gradients and reversals in vertical gradients across the fault. 3) A region of downward flow exists at the western edge of the study area (eastern edge of Arroyo Hondo study area), where shal- low ground water (in alluvium) moves verti- cally downward into buried volcanic rocks near the Gates of Valdez. This transition defines the edge of the Arroyo Seco shallow alluvial aquifer. 4) Buried volcanic rocks near the Gates of Valdez form a high transmissivity unit with a downward gradient. Based on geologic mapping presented in this report, these bur- ied volcanic rocks correspond to the eastern edge of the Cerro Negro dacite complex that is exposed by incision of the Rio Hondo at the Gates of Valdez and on the flanks of Cerro Negro near Arroyo Hondo. 5) Ground water studies should depend on new water level measurements rather than those listed on well records. IV. HYDROGEOLOGIC FRAMEWORK ARROYO HONDO 19 Reiter and Sandoval (2004) reported on mea- sured temperature logs from eight wells in the Taos Valley. Although none are in our study area, one well (BOR-7) is located less than two miles from the southeast corner of our area. They noted a very high temperature gradient near the water table surface indicating cool ground water flow, with possible upward flow from about 820 feet depth or a zone of warm, sub-horizontal flow at about 820 feet depth. They also found this well to be hydrogeologi- cally disconnected from the nearby wells, and concluded that their data indicate that the hy- drogeology of the Taos Plateau is complex, and may be divided into hydrogeologic cells by high- angle faults that act as both seals and pathways for ground water flow. Benson (2004) produced a ground water map of Taos County from water levels and lithologic logs compiled from NMOSE well records. He proposed that a buried series of north-striking and east-striking faults compartmentalize the \u201cwater table\u201d in the Stagecoach Hills/Hondo Mesa area. As we discuss below, our study confirms the complex character of the hydro- geologic system in the area, but we interpret the complexities as due to changes in permeability and transmissivity of multiple aquifers. Aero- magnetic data of Grauch (personal communica- tion) provides no indication of buried faults in the study area. Furthermore, based on measured water levels, we find no evidence of the isolated ground water mounds and depressions that are shown on the Figure 4 water table map of Benson (2004), but do identify multiple aquifers with a large vertical head differential. He also noted that \u201crecharge appears to tie directly to the Rio Hondo water level to the north\u201d, and that north of the Rio Hondo \u201cthe water table is about 200 feet above the adjacent Rio Hondo, and is probably recharged from high on Cerro Negro approximately ten miles northeast.\u201d Our cross sections contest this interpretation, as the measured water levels in the volcanic units north of the Rio Hondo are consistently more than 100 feet below the elevation of the river bed and regional ground water flow direction is to the west. Benson (2004) also reported on the results of major and trace element laboratory analyses of 100 well samples scattered through- out Taos County. He concluded that water qual- ity is generally excellent, although many wells contain hard water, and some areas have elevated levels of some constituents. The wells that he sampled in our study area all appear to contain high-quality drinking water. Drakos et al. (2004b) reported on the geochem- istry and residence time of ground water in the Taos Valley. Although no samples were taken in our study area, they did sample several wells a few miles south and southeast of the Arroyo Hondo study area. They concluded that: 1) Residence time of ground water in the shallow aquifer ranges from less than 5 to about 10"

They concluded that: 1) Residence time of ground water in the shallow aquifer ranges from less than 5 to about 10 years; 2) Recharge to some leaky-confined wells in alluvium takes more than 50 years; 3) Recharge to the Agua Azul aquifer (sedi- ments between middle and upper Servilleta basalts) takes more than 50 years; 4) Isotopic data suggest that deep wells in basin-fill alluvium have received Pleistocene recharge (older than about 10,000 years), whereas others have received Holocene recharge; 5) Large intrabasin faults cause some compart- mentalization of the Tertiary aquifer system. Bauer et al. (2008) recently completed an inven- tory and preliminary geochemical investigation of springs in the Rio Grande gorge of Taos County. Forty three of the surveyed springs lie within the Arroyo Hondo study area (Fig. 4). The geologic setting and geochemistry of these springs, com- bined with well data, contribute to our concep- tual hydrogeologic model. Nearly all of the cool springs emerge from near the base of the eastern gorge cliffs within about 50 vertical feet above the river. Where exposures of bedrock are suf- ficient, it appears that some of the springs emerge from the base of the basalt. The springs are generally small, and distributed in lines of springs NEW MEXICO BUREAU OF GEOLOGY AND MINERAL RESOURCES 20 and seeps. The largest measured discharge is 144 gal/min, although most springs flow at less than 15 gal/min. The principal clusters of springs in the Ar- royo Hondo study area are summarized below. 1) North of the Rio Hondo confluence, the Dunn Bridge North spring zone consists of 20 springs and seeps that emerge from basalt debris at an elevation of approximately 6516 feet. The largest single discharge was measured at 144 gal/min in TS-31a, with a cumulative estimate of 239 gal/min for the zone. The springs are cool (59\u00baF, 15\u00baC), and TS-31a yielded a CFC age of 36 \u00b1 2 years and a tritium concentration of 4.5 tritium units (TU) in 2004. The southernmost spring in the zone, the Rael Spring (TS-18, elevation 6460), yielded a tritium value of 4.0 TU in 2006. Based on geologic maps and cross sec- tions, we interpret these springs to discharge from the lower silicic alkalic basalt (unit Tbsa). 2) The Lower Arroyo Hondo spring zone is located on the north bank of Rio Hondo near the confluence with the Rio Grande. The zone consists of a long seep zone plus two springs emerging from the base of the basalts at an elevation range of about 6500 to 6515 feet. The total estimated discharge is 53 gal/min, the water is cool (58\u00baF, 14\u00baC) and yielded a tritium concentration of 6.0 TU in 2004. Based on geologic maps and cross sections, we interpret these springs to discharge from the lower silicic alkalic basalt (unit Tbsa). 3) The Medina spring discharges from stream terrace deposits on the southern flank of Cerro Negro on the north side of the Arroyo Hondo valley at an elevation of approxi- mately 6810 feet. No field parameters or dis- charge estimates are available, but anecdotal information describes the Medina spring as seasonal. Based on geologic maps and cross sections, we interpret the Medina spring to discharge from a perched aquifer that over- lies the Cerro Negro dacite (unit Td) on the north side of the Rio Hondo. 4) The Godoi North spring zone is a cluster of many small springs and seeps located about 1000 meters downstream of the confluence that discharge from the base of the basalt. The zone has an estimated cumulative dis- charge of 122 gal/min, with the largest single spring discharging about 30 gal/min at an elevation of 6447 feet The springs are cool (63\u201367\u00baF, 17\u201319\u00baC), with field-measured dis- solved oxygen from 6.5\u20138.2 mg/L, a CFC age of 53 \u00b1 2 years, and a tritium concentration of 0.6 TU. Based on geologic maps and cross sections, we interpret the Godoi North spring zone to discharge either from the lower silicic alkalic basalt (unit Tbsa) or one of the Servil- leta Formation basalt flows (unit Tb3). 5) The Godoi South spring zone is a line of springs nearly 1000 meters long, just up- stream of Manby Hot Springs. The cumula- tive discharge was estimated at 112 gal/min, with the largest spring (TS-51) discharging about 30 gal/min at an elevation of 6467 feet.

Ground Water Flow System Hydrostratigraphic Units\u2013Four major hy- drostratigraphic units \u2013 geologic units with distinct hydrologic characteristics \u2013 exist in the Arroyo Hondo area. From geologically young- est to oldest (stratigraphically highest to lowest), these are: 1) modern floodplain and terrace de- posits (geologic units Qt and Qal on figures 6, 7 and 13), Quaternary alluvial fan and Quaternary surficial deposits (Qf and Qal), the Blueberry Hill alluvial fan deposit (QTbh, south of the Rio Hondo) or its northern equivalent (QTg), and upper Tertiary alluvial fan deposits overly- ing volcanic rocks (Tg); 2) the complex of dacite flows and interlayered sediments belonging to the Cerro Negro volcano (Td); 3) Tertiary basalt flows of the Servilleta Formation and interlay- ered sediments belonging to the upper Chamita Formation (Tb and Tg); and 4) lower Santa Fe Group alluvial deposits belonging to the lower Tertiary Chamita and/or Tesuque Formations (Tc) that lie below the oldest Servilleta Forma- tion basalt and the Cerro Negro dacite. Each of these hydrostratigraphic units appears to have distinct hydrological characteristics. Distribu- tion of the geologic and hydrostratigraphic units is best understood through examination of the geologic maps (Figs. 6 and 7) and cross sections (Fig. 13). Hydrogeologic Cross Sections\u2013Many observa- tions and interpretations of the Arroyo Hondo ground water flow system were made from an analysis of geologic cross sections, and well and water level data. Based on an analysis of 110 water well records (Fig. 4 and Table A1), the high-resolution aeromagnetic data (Fig. 10), and the geologic maps (Figs. 6 and 7), we constructed seven detailed cross sections through the study area (Figs. 13a and 13b) that depict the subsur- face distribution of geologic and hydrostrati- graphic units, well data, surface water features, water levels, faults, and zones of fracturing and sediment layers in volcanic rocks. East-west cross sections (A\u2013A\u2019, B\u2013B\u2019, C\u2013C\u2019) are constructed generally parallel to regional ground water flow and extend from the eastern limit of the study area to the Rio Grande south of the Rio Hondo (A\u2013A\u2019) and along the edge of the Cerro Negro volcano north of the Rio Hondo (C\u2013C\u2019). Cross section B\u2013B\u2019 is constructed similar to A\u2013A\u2019, but provides additional information on the nature of ground water flow in the vicinity of the Airport fault. North-south cross sections (D\u2013D\u2019, E\u2013E\u2019, F\u2013F\u2019 and G\u2013G\u2019) are constructed generally per- pendicular to regional ground water flow and extend from north of the Rio Hondo on the southern flank of Cerro Negro to the southern edge of the study area in the center of the alluvial plateau (Hondo Mesa). These cross sections il- lustrate the subsurface distribution, location and extent of aquifers in the context of the geologic framework and the Rio Hondo, local acequias, and other surface water features, and provide insight regarding geologic controls on ground water flow. Summary of Aquifers and Hydrostratigraphic Units Regional ground water in the Arroyo Hondo area exists primarily within the Quaternary-Ter- tiary alluvial fan sediments known as the Blue- berry Hill deposit, the Servilleta Formation ba- salts and interbedded sediments, the lower Santa Fe Group alluvial deposits, and locally within the Cerro Negro dacite. These hydrogeologic units are grouped into three separate aquifers on the basis of their hydrologic characteristics and dis- tribution (Tables 1 and A1). Sufficient data exist to contour a water table surface for the shallow alluvial aquifer in the Quaternary-Tertiary Blue- berry Hill deposit, and a potentiometric surface for the deeper volcanic-alluvial aquifer (Fig. 14). Ground water flow conditions in this complex aquifer system are discussed below.

This saturated zone forms a distinct hydrostratigraphic unit, hy- drologically separate from deeper water-bearing zones and aquifers in underlying volcanic (Td) and sedimentary (Tc) rocks, and is referred to as the Arroyo Hondo shallow alluvial aquifer. This aquifer is generally equivalent to the \u201cshallow\u201d aquifer of Drakos et al. (2004a). Depth to ground water in the shallow al- luvial aquifer varies from less than 20 to more than 300 feet. Shallow water levels are encoun- tered in the Rio Hondo valley below the Llano Ditch and in wells near the active river channel. The greatest depth to ground water occurs on the alluvial plateau south of the Hondo valley and on the alluvial fans near the mountain front. Saturated thickness ranges from about 25 to 275 feet. Yields for wells in the Blueberry Hill allu- vial deposit range from 15 to 30 gal/min (gpm), with an average of 19 gpm (Table 1). The aqui- fer is composed of semi-consolidated, poorly to moderately well sorted layers of clay, silt, sand, pebbles, and cobbles that are laterally heteroge- neous. The hydraulic conductivity of 0.4 ft/day reported by Drakos et al. (2004a) (Table 1) is at the low end of the published range for clean sands and gravels, but is probably reasonable for a poorly sorted, clayey unit such as the Blueberry Hill deposit. In addition, in some areas where the Blueberry Hill deposit is well exposed, it is moderately well cemented and altered. Ground water flow direction in the shallow alluvial aquifer is generally east to west. Static water levels in the aquifer define a shallowly west-dipping water table surface that ranges in elevation from 7200 feet at the eastern boundary to 6680 feet at its western extent near the Air- port fault, for an average gradient of about 115 feet/mile or 0.02. The water table surface grades to the Rio Hondo, generally mimics topography, and is locally elevated in the vicinity of acequias and irrigated fields. The shallow alluvial aquifer does not exist in thin alluvial fan deposits north of the Rio Hondo or west of the Airport fault, and is evident in only a few wells south of the Rio Hondo drainage divide. Near Arroyo Hondo, the shallow alluvial aquifer is a semi-perched aquifer. Accretion of ground water in the Blueberry Hill alluvial fan deposit is controlled by a combination of perme- ability differences between the alluvial sediments and underlying Cerro Negro dacite and the pres- ence of active sources of recharge. The Cerro Ne- gro dacite is a perching unit. Its distribution at shallow depths in the subsurface (Fig. 10) is con- tiguous with the shallow alluvial aquifer, and the Blueberry Hill alluvial deposit is only saturated where it overlies this massive, crystalline volcanic unit. Cerro Negro dacite is much less perme- able than the Blueberry Hill deposit as a whole. Therefore, in areas where Blueberry Hill alluvial fan sediments are underlain directly by Cerro Negro dacite, conditions are generally favorable for accretion of ground water in the overlying alluvium. To the west, where Cerro Negro dacite is either overlain by Servilleta Formation basalts and interlayered sediments, or is truncated by or terminates against the Airport fault, saturation in the Blueberry Hill rapidly thins and disappears across a zone of downward leakage as ground water moves into the more permeable, underly- ing units (Fig. 13a, cross sections A\u2013A\u2019 and B\u2013B\u2019, and Fig. 14).

The water table surface grades to the Rio Hondo, generally mimics topography, and is locally elevated in the vicinity of acequias and irrigated fields. The shallow alluvial aquifer does not exist in thin alluvial fan deposits north of the Rio Hondo or west of the Airport fault, and is evident in only a few wells south of the Rio Hondo drainage divide. Near Arroyo Hondo, the shallow alluvial aquifer is a semi-perched aquifer. Accretion of ground water in the Blueberry Hill alluvial fan deposit is controlled by a combination of perme- ability differences between the alluvial sediments and underlying Cerro Negro dacite and the pres- ence of active sources of recharge. The Cerro Ne- gro dacite is a perching unit. Its distribution at shallow depths in the subsurface (Fig. 10) is con- tiguous with the shallow alluvial aquifer, and the Blueberry Hill alluvial deposit is only saturated where it overlies this massive, crystalline volcanic unit. Cerro Negro dacite is much less perme- able than the Blueberry Hill deposit as a whole. Therefore, in areas where Blueberry Hill alluvial fan sediments are underlain directly by Cerro Negro dacite, conditions are generally favorable for accretion of ground water in the overlying alluvium. To the west, where Cerro Negro dacite is either overlain by Servilleta Formation basalts and interlayered sediments, or is truncated by or terminates against the Airport fault, saturation in the Blueberry Hill rapidly thins and disappears across a zone of downward leakage as ground water moves into the more permeable, underly- ing units (Fig. 13a, cross sections A\u2013A\u2019 and B\u2013B\u2019, and Fig. 14). Spiegel and Couse (1969) were the first to recognize that the ancient stream-terrace deposits along the present streams were probably above the water table under natural conditions, but now have locally perched or semi-perched zones of saturation due to the development of irriga- tion. In the Rio Hondo drainage, the distribution of recharge from surface water and irrigation is a critical factor controlling the extent of the shal- low alluvial aquifer. Channel infiltration through losing reaches of the Rio Hondo, leakage from local acequias, irrigation return, and infiltration of runoff through arroyo channels on the alluvial uplands are the primary sources of recharge to the shallow aquifer. No significant sources of NEW MEXICO BUREAU OF GEOLOGY AND MINERAL RESOURCES ARROYO HONDO 25 Figure 14\u2212Ground water flow conditions in the Arroyo Hondo area. NEW MEXICO BUREAU OF GEOLOGY AND MINERAL RESOURCES 26 recharge exist on the alluvial plateau to the south, which is isolated from mountain runoff and has no acequias or irrigation. Arroyo chan- nel infiltration may provide local, ephemeral recharge to the narrow strip of shallow aquifer that exists on the alluvial plateau (Figs. 3 and 14). Limited well data on the alluvial plateau, south of the Rio Hondo drainage divide, sug- gest that shallow alluvial ground water in the Blueberry Hill deposit disappears in a zone of downward flow as the Cerro Negro dacite dips to greater depths. Shallow Perched Aquifer\u2013A local zone of perched ground water exists in Quaternary- Tertiary alluvial fan deposits north of the Rio Hondo on the southwest flank of Cerro Negro (Fig. 14). Similar to the shallow alluvial aqui- fer in the Blueberry Hill alluvial deposit to the south, this perched ground water accumulates in older alluvial fan (QTg) and modern stream terrace (Qt) deposits by ponding on the surface of relatively impermeable Cerro Negro dacite flows. A static water level in shallow alluvial well AH-04 (cross section F\u2013F\u2019), located downslope of the Acequia de Atalaya, indicates a saturated thickness of 64 feet. The Medina spring (Fig. 4 and cross section F\u2013F\u2019) represents the southern- most extent of this shallow perched aquifer. We interpret the Medina spring to discharge shallow, perched ground water that is recharged by leak- age and irrigation return flow from the acequia. An elevated water level in well AH-01, a 420 ft well completed in volcanic and alluvial units north of the Rio Hondo and west of the Airport fault, may indicate that downward leakage from the shallow perched aquifer recharges deeper volcanic aquifers north of the Rio Hondo (Fig. 13a, cross section C\u2013C\u2019). The lower Rio Hondo spring zone, located down gradient of AH-01 on the north bank of the river, may reflect discharge from this local flow system. A tritium content of 6 TU in TS-33 (Bauer et al., 2008) indicates a surprisingly short residence time of 1 to 5 years *From select wells nearest Arroyo Hondo study area.

Cerro Negro Dacite\u2013The Cerro Negro dacite, primarily a massive crystalline volcanic unit, contains localized, productive aquifers in frac- tured and rubble zones but generally appears to behave as a perching bed for shallow alluvial aquifers in overlying Quaternary and Tertiary alluvial fan deposits (QTbh, QTg, and upper Tg). Virtually all records for wells completed in the dacite indicate water-bearing strata to be fractured volcanic rock, decomposed \u2018basalt\u2019, or thin zones of black sand and gravel. Where wells encounter water in the Cerro Negro dacite, yields range from 10 to 50 gpm, with an aver- age of 25 gpm (Table 1).

With the exception of these volcanic sedi- ment and fracture zones, the unit has extremely limited porosity and permeability.

Most wells penetrate a substantial thickness of massive vol- canic rock before encountering a water-bearing zone, and a few wells penetrate the entire thick- ness of the dacite unit before encountering water in underlying lower Tertiary sediments. North of the Rio Hondo (east-west cross section C\u2013C\u2019 and north-south cross sections), virtually all wells are completed in Cerro Negro dacite, most of these in fracture and rubble zones or intervals of sand or gravel. Static water levels (measured and recorded) in these wells are highly variable and are often regionally discontinuous, but are significantly lower than those measured in overlying perched or shallow alluvial aqui- fers. Hydrologic connection between isolated fractured aquifers within the Cerro Negro, and between the Cerro Negro aquifers and contigu- ous aquifers in Servilleta Formation basalts and sediments to the west and south, is unknown. Due to the geologic heterogeneity of the Cerro Negro dacite, it is likely that many of these fractured volcanic aquifers may exist in isolated, local compartments with limited interconnection and limited connection with adjacent aquifers (see section on Geology of the Arroyo Hondo Area, Volcanic Rocks). East of NM-522 and south of the Rio Hondo, in the eastern half of the study area, only three wells are completed in the Cerro Negro dacite (Td), and the static water levels appear to grade westward to the deep volcanic-alluvial aquifer beneath Hondo Mesa. Where Cerro Negro dacite and Servilleta Formation basalts and sediments are interlayered beneath Hondo Mesa (Figs. 6 and 10), these two geologic units may behave as a single hydrostratigraphic unit referred to as the deep volcanic-alluvial aquifer and discussed below. Servilleta Formation and Deep Volcanic-Alluvial Aquifer\u2013The Servilleta Formation constitutes a complex, three-dimensional aquifer system that is distinct from the shallow aquifer existing in Qua- ternary-Tertiary alluvial fan deposits. Wells com- pleted in Servilleta Formation basalt flows (Tb, Tb1, Tb2, Tb3, Tb4) and interbedded sedimen- tary horizons (Tg) exist almost exclusively at or west of the Airport fault beneath western Hondo Mesa. Deep wells screened in some combination of sediments and volcanic rocks also exist south of the Rio Hondo drainage divide beneath south- ern Hondo Mesa, but at this location lithologic data are not sufficient to distinguish between interlayered Cerro Negro dacite and Servilleta basalts. For this study, this deep water-bearing zone is referred to as the deep volcanic-alluvial aquifer and is generally equivalent to the Agua Azul aquifer of Drakos et al. (2004a). We infer that this deep aquifer system may underlie the entire study area, but limited data from deep wells in the central and eastern por- tions of the Arroyo Hondo area, and variable, regionally inconsistent water levels in the Cerro Negro dacite, make this inference somewhat speculative. Water level elevations in wells com- pleted in the deep aquifer range from about 7300 feet in the east to 6480 feet in the west and are well below the elevation of the Rio Hondo. The potentiometric surface indicates that ground wa- ter flows east to west and grades to the elevation NEW MEXICO BUREAU OF GEOLOGY AND MINERAL RESOURCES 28 of cool springs that emerge at 6450 to 6470 feet in the Rio Grande gorge just above the river (Fig. 14). Tritium content and CFC (chlorofluo- rocarbon) recharge ages by Bauer et al. (2008) indicate a CFC recharge age of 36 \u00b1 2 years and a tritium content of 4.54 TU (tritium units) for Dunn Bridge North spring (TS-31a) north of the Rio Hondo confluence, and 53 \u00b1 2 years for Godoi North 2 spring (TS-36b) south of the Rio Hondo confluence. The primary porosity and permeability of the basalts is very low, although the pahoe- hoe (ropy) flow tops provide some horizon- tal permeability. The secondary porosity and permeability supplied by the extensive network of open, vertical and sub-vertical fractures is large, although the storage capacity of basalts as a whole is probably low. The porosity of the interlayered sand- and gravel-dominated sedi- ments is large, perhaps as high as 30 percent. The sediments can probably store significant amounts of water, but the flow may be restrict- ed by interbedded clay intervals. We expect that ground water can move easily between layers of basalts and sediments within the Servilleta For- mation. The uniform hydraulic gradient east of the Rio Grande, through Tb3 and adjacent Tg sediments, supports this interpretation. Records of wells completed in the deep volcanic-alluvial aquifer west of the Airport fault indicate that the basalts are the primary water-bearing strata in this aquifer (Fig 13a, cross sections A\u2013A\u2019, B\u2013B\u2019). Wells completed in basalt intervals of the Servilleta Formation (Tb) have yields ranging from 17 to 30 gpm, with an average of 24 gpm, whereas yields from interlayered sediments (Tg) range from 4 to 30 gpm, with an average of 17 gpm. Yields from wells completed in both vol- canic and sediment intervals reflect intermediate values of 10 to 25 gpm, with an average of 17 gpm (Table 1). The only readily available report of a tested well in the Servilleta Formation is the River View Acres test well (RG-87960) as reported by Jenkins (1980). The 510 foot well was perfo- rated at 500\u2013510 feet in gravel of the Servil- leta Formation. Its specific capacity after one hour of pumping at 9.2 gal/min was 2.6 gal/min/ ft of drawdown. Transmissivity calculated from recovery data was 1250 ft2/day and the estimated hydraulic conductivity is 96 ft/day (Table 1). The report concluded that the aquifer is highly per- meable, and is capable of supplying the planned domestic wells for the subdivision. Airport Fault Transition Zone\u2013On Hondo Mesa, the southern cross sections (A\u2013A\u2019 and B\u2013B\u2019) delineate a narrow transition between shallow alluvial and deep volcanic-alluvial aquifers.

This zone corresponds to a north-trending projection of the Airport fault and the western limit of thick Cerro Negro dacite flows in the subsurface. The Airport fault transition zone is a high-permea- bility zone associated with a strong downward gradient from the shallow alluvial aquifer to the deep volcanic-alluvial aquifer. Well depths east of the transition are shallow, ranging from 200 to 300 feet, and to the west are 400 to 550 feet. Across the transition, measured water levels in the shallow water-bearing zone drop as much as 200 feet, with reports of cascading water in wells. The hydraulic gradient increases dramatically from about 0.014 in the shallow aquifer zone to the east, to 0.3 in the transition zone at the fault, and back to 0.012 in the deep volcanic-alluvial aquifer to the west. Due to east-down displace- ment along the fault and the regional eastern dip of Servilleta Formation basalts and sediments, the Blueberry Hill deposit (QTbh) and the uppermost Servilleta Formation basalt (Tb4) are unsaturated west of the Airport fault. Thus the Airport fault transition zone defines the western extent of the shallow alluvial aquifer. Throughout the study area, shallow alluvial wells have higher static water levels than those completed in the deep volcanic-alluvial aquifer, and in general, adjacent pairs of shallow and deep wells have measured water-level elevations differing by more than 300 feet in head. This ver- tical head differential defines a regional, vertically downward hydraulic gradient that implies down- ward leakage from the shallow alluvial aquifer to the deep volcanic-alluvial aquifer. Where the hydraulic gradient of the shallow aquifer steepens ARROYO HONDO 29 dramatically at the Airport fault, shallow water levels rapidly merge with the elevation head in deep volcanic-alluvial wells on the west side of the fault (cross sections A\u2013A\u2019, B\u2013B\u2019 and G\u2013G\u2019). Relatively young CFC recharge ages and signifi- cant tritium content in springs emerging in the Rio Grande gorge as discharge from the deep volcanic-alluvial aquifer suggest that shallow alluvial ground water merging with the deep aquifer at the Airport fault transition zone com- prises a significant portion of the ground water discharging at the springs. Lower Santa Fe Group Alluvial (Chamita) Aquifer\u2013Ground water encountered in the lower Santa Fe Group alluvial deposits probably be- longs to the deep alluvial aquifer that pervades the southern San Luis Basin. Little is known about the deep basin-fill (Chamita) aquifer, either regionally or within the Arroyo Hondo area. A few wells in the study area penetrate a full thickness of Cerro Negro dacite or Servil- leta basalts (300 to 500 feet) and terminate in water-bearing sediments of the Chamita Forma- tion. Reported yields from these wells vary from 10 to 100 gpm. At some localities that have either a thick unsaturated zone or non-water bearing zone of volcanic rocks and sediments, the Chamita aquifer constitutes the shallowest available ground water. Water levels in these wells are consistent with other wells in the deep volcanic-alluvial aquifer, and for this study, we make no distinction between the water-bearing zones at the top of the Chamita basin fill and those in overlying volcanic rocks. Surface Water and Ground Water Interactions The Rio Hondo is a small tributary to the Rio Grande, with peak annual flows of generally less than 300 cfs, and with major flood flows of only about 500 cfs. The Rio Hondo origi- nates as ground water discharge in the Sangre de Cristo Mountains watershed, and as runoff from snowmelt and direct storm precipitation. Quaternary alluvium along the modern stream channel forms a narrow strip of saturated gravel that is probably less than about 20 feet thick in most areas. The alluvium probably has a similar permeability as the underlying Quater- nary alluvial fan sediments. Beginning near the mountain front, acequia systems divert water for agriculture along both sides of the stream. As the diverted water passes along ditches, and is applied to fields, a portion infiltrates into the ground. This artificial recharge plays a significant role in sustaining the shallow alluvial aquifers, as indicated by ground water mounds and perched ground water beneath the three major acequias and ditches in the study area. As noted by Spiegel and Couse (1969), the Rio Hondo is part of a stream-connected aquifer system and shallow wells in the upper Arroyo Hondo valley are hydraulically connected to the Rio Hondo. The ground water study by Rawl- ing (2005) indicates that, from the mountain front near El Salto to the Gates of Valdez, the Rio Hondo is a gaining stream. At the Gates of Valdez, the limited water level data suggest that the stream is approximately neutral. Down- stream from the Gates of Valdez, the stream- aquifer connection is strongly influenced by the complex geology of the Cerro Negro volcano and overlying basin-fill sediments. Where the stream channel incises into recent and Quater- nary alluvial sediments, both the nearby water levels and local geology suggest the stream loses water to the adjacent shallow alluvial aquifer. Where the stream channel crosses massive, low permeability, Cerro Negro dacite flows, there is no geologic or hydrologic evidence of connection with the shallow alluvial aquifer and these reach- es are designated \u201cno flow\u201d on Figure 14. At the western edge of the Arroyo Hondo agricultural valley, where the Rio Hondo has incised along the contact between Cerro Negro dacite and the Quaternary-Tertiary Blueberry Hill deposit, water levels suggest that the Rio Hondo briefly gains water from the shallow alluvial aquifer.

Because of interconnections between the Rio Hondo, the Rio Grande and shallow and deep aquifers, depletions of ground water from these aquifers have the very real potential of contrib- uting to surface water depletions in a matter of decades or less. Similarly, reductions in irrigation would have negative effects on ground water levels in the shallow alluvial aquifer. ARROYO HONDO 31 The Arroyo Hondo ground water study reveals a complex, three-dimensional ground water system with multiple hydrostratigraphic units and aqui- fers. Distribution of the geologic and hydrostrati- graphic units is presented through geologic maps (Figs. 6 and 7) and seven detailed cross sections (Figs. 13a & 13b) that depict the subsurface distribution of geologic and hydrostratigraphic units, well data, surface water features, water levels, faults, and zones of fracturing and sedi- ment layers in volcanic rocks. Cross sections are constructed both parallel and perpendicular to regional ground water flow. These cross sections illustrate the subsurface distribution, location and extent of aquifers in the context of the geologic framework, the Rio Grande and the Rio Hondo, local acequias and other surface water features. The following summarizes the most sa- lient conclusions of this study regarding regional hydrogeology and geologic controls on ground water flow. 1) Ground water exists primarily within the Quaternary-Tertiary alluvial fan sediments known as the Blueberry Hill deposit, the Servilleta Formation basalts and interbed- ded sediments, the lower Santa Fe Group alluvial deposits (Chamita Formation), and locally within the Cerro Negro dacite. These hydrogeologic units are grouped into three separate aquifers on the basis of their hydrologic characteristics and distribution. 2) A shallow alluvial aquifer in the Quaterna- ry-Tertiary Blueberry Hill alluvial fan de- posit is limited to an area south of the Rio Hondo and east of the Airport fault. This aquifer is semi-perched on the Cerro Negro dacite, a massive, crystalline volcanic unit with relatively low regional permeability, V. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS and is recharged primarily through local irrigation return flow. 3) A shallow perched aquifer exists in the Quaternary-Tertiary alluvial fan deposit north of the Rio Hondo on the southwest flank of Cerro Negro. Perched ground wa- ter accumulates on the Cerro Negro dacite, recharges from Acequia de Atalaya, and discharges from the Medina spring, and possibly the lower Rio Hondo springs. 4) The Cerro Negro dacite contains localized, productive aquifers in fractured and rubble zones but generally behaves as a perch- ing unit for shallow alluvial and perched aquifers. Where wells encounter water in the dacite, yields can be as high as 50 gpm, with an average of 25 gpm. Static water levels are highly variable, regionally incon- sistent, and significantly lower than those measured in overlying perched or shallow alluvial aquifers. It is likely that fractured aquifers in the Cerro Negro dacite are highly compartmentalized, and have only limited or partial interconnection with adjacent aquifers. 5) The Servilleta Formation, named the deep volcanic-alluvial aquifer in this study, contains productive zones in thin basalts and sediments west of the Airport fault. A uniform hydraulic gradient between the Airport fault and the Rio Grande suggests that ground water moves easily between and through the interlayered basalts and sediments. This potentiometric surface grades westward to the elevation of cool springs that emerge in the Rio Grande gorge. Tritium content and CFC (chloroflu- orocarbon) recharge ages suggest a ground water residence time of 36 to 53 years. Due NEW MEXICO BUREAU OF GEOLOGY AND MINERAL RESOURCES 32 to limited data and variable, regionally inconsistent water levels in deep wells east of the Airport fault, it is uncertain whether this deep aquifer system underlies the entire study area or if it includes the Cerro Negro dacite. 6) A transition zone between shallow and deep aquifers occurs at the Airport fault, which defines the western extent of the Cerro Negro dacite and the shallow allu- vial aquifer. A vertical head differential of more than 300 feet defines a regional, verti- cally downward hydraulic gradient that implies downward leakage from shallow to deep aquifers. The Airport fault forms a high-permeability zone with a strong, local downward gradient, where shallow water levels east of the fault rapidly merge with those in deep volcanic-alluvial wells to the west. Relatively young recharge ages in springs discharging in the Rio Grande gorge from the deep volcanic-alluvial aqui- fer suggest that shallow alluvial ground water merging with the deep aquifer at the Airport fault transition zone comprises a significant portion of the ground water discharging at the springs. 7) The Rio Hondo is part of a stream-con- nected aquifer system with gaining, neutral and losing reaches controlled by the perme- ability of underlying geologic units con- tacting the stream channel. Shallow wells in alluvium of the upper Arroyo Hondo valley are hydraulically connected to the Rio Hondo. The alluvial deposits along the Rio Hondo were probably above the water table under natural conditions, but now have locally perched or semi-perched zones of saturation due to the development of irrigation. In the Rio Hondo drainage, accretion of ground water from surface water and irrigation recharge is a critical factor controlling the extent of the shallow alluvial aquifer.

Tertiary Rocks Tb Servilleta Formation, basalt (Pliocene)\u2013 Dark-gray, diktytaxitic olivine tholeiite that forms thin, fluid, widespread pahoehoe ba- salt flows of the Taos Plateau volcanic field. These flows commonly form columnar- jointed cliffs in the Rio Grande gorge. Tab- ular plagioclase and sparse olivine are the only phenocrysts. Individual flows, which are up to 12 m thick, are grouped into packages of from one to ten flows (Dungan et al., 1984). These packages are separated by sedimentary intervals. Five central vol- canic vents to the north are sources for the Servilleta Formation (Lipman and Meh- nert, 1979). 40Ar/39Ar ages from basalts ex- posed in the Rio Grande gorge range in age from 4.81 \u00b1 0.03 Ma for the lowest basalt near the Rio Grande Gorge Bridge, to 3.12 \u00b1 0.13 Ma for the highest basalt flow at the Rio Grande Gorge Bridge. Tg Servilleta Formation, interbasalt gravel (Pliocene)\u2013Sedimentary intervals between basalt flow members, as much as 180 m thick in northern part of quadrangle, as exposed in the Rio Grande and Rio San Cristobal gorges. Td Cerro Negro dacite (Pliocene)\u2013dark- gray to black, non-vesicular, two-pyroxene dacite flows that erupted from a variety of vents on and around Cerro Negro. Dacite flows are at least partly interlayered with Servilleta Formation basalt flows. Tsf Santa Fe Group, undivided (Pliocene to Miocene)\u2013In cross sections only. Consists primarily of rift-related, clastic sedimentary deposits of the Tesuque Formation that underlie the Servilleta Formation in the map area. Mixed conglomerate, sandstone, and mudrock were derived from the Sangre de Cristo Mountains and Tusas Mountains. Lacustrine deposits may exist locally. The eolian Ojo Caliente Sandstone Member (middle to late Miocene) may exist in the subsurface. Older volcaniclastic units equivalent to the Los Pinos Formation, Chama-El Rito Member of the Tesuque Formation, and Picuris Formation may ex- ist in the subsurface. Thickness unknown.
