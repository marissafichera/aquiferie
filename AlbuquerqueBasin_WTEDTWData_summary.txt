A concise overview of how the water table (potentiometric) and depth-to-water maps were created:

• Data Sources:  
  – USGS 2012 potentiometric surface dataset (for areas west of Juan Tabo Boulevard).  
  – Groundwater-level data from USGS and the New Mexico Office of the State Engineer–WRRS (mainly non-pumping wells) for areas east of Juan Tabo Boulevard.  
  – Additional measurements spanning 2010–2016 to improve spatial coverage.  

• Measurements and Time Frame:  
  – Groundwater-level data were primarily collected from non-pumping wells during winter months (November–February) from 2011 to 2013, aligning with the 2012 USGS dataset.  
  – Some older or more recent measurements (2010–2016) were included where needed.  

• Interpolation Method:  
  – A regularized spline function in ArcGIS was used to interpolate groundwater elevations, forcing the surface through known water-level points.  
  – Contours were drawn at 20-ft intervals to match the USGS format.  

• Manual Adjustments:  
  – Contours were locally modified based on specific geologic features (e.g., faults near Sandia Pueblo) and coverage limitations (e.g., near Domingo Baca Canyon and Tijeras Arroyo).  

• Final Maps:  
  – Potentiometric surfaces were subtracted from land-surface elevations to derive depth-to-water values.  
  – Additional geologic and geophysical data (e.g., borehole logs, seismic-reflection data, lidar estimates of surface water) helped refine areas near the Rio Grande and other complex zones.  

Overall, these combined measurements, interpolation methods, and targeted adjustments produced a detailed depiction of groundwater elevations and depths in the middle Rio Grande Basin region.
