Introduction 1 Selected Investigations and Statistical Summary of Surface-Water Quality in the Rio Grande and the Rio Chama, North-Central New Mexico, During Water Years 1985\u20132007 By Sarah E. Falk, Scott K. Anderholm, and Nicholas B. Engdahl Abstract The Albuquerque Bernalillo County Water Utility Authority (ABCWUA) is supplementing the municipal water supply for Albuquerque, New Mexico, and the surrounding area with water diverted from the Rio Grande. The distribution of surface water for municipal supply has raised questions about the quality of water in the Rio Grande and the possibility of contaminants in the water. The U.S. Geological Survey, in cooperation with ABCWUA, has compiled existing water- quality data collected on the Rio Grande and its main tributary, the Rio Chama, by various Federal and State agencies to provide a comprehensive overview of water quality in the Rio Grande basin upstream from Albuquerque. This report describes selected water-quality investigations conducted by various Federal and State agencies and 2007 USGS surface- water-quality investigations and data-collection activities and presents a statistical summary of selected water-quality data collected on the Rio Grande and the Rio Chama in central and northern New Mexico. Introduction The Albuquerque Bernalillo County Water Utility Authority (ABCWUA) is supplementing the municipal water supply for Albuquerque, N. Mex., and the surrounding area with water diverted from the Rio Grande. Historically, groundwater has been pumped from the Santa Fe Group aquifer at a rate that has resulted in water-level declines in the aquifer near the metropolitan area (Bexfield and Anderholm, 2002). The principal component of ABCWUA\u2019s strategy to obtain and develop sustainable sources of water is the San Juan-Chama Drinking Water Project, which includes a diversion dam, water treatment facilities, and a distribution system (City of Albuquerque, 1997). Water diverted from the Rio Grande will be treated by a \u201cmultistage purification process, which employs carbon filtration and ozone disinfection\u2026\u201d (Albuquerque Bernalillo County Water Utility Authority, 2011). The distribution of surface water for municipal supply has raised questions about the quality of water in the Rio Grande and the possibility of contaminants in the water. The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), in cooperation with ABCWUA, has compiled existing water-quality data from water year (WY) 1985 through WY 2005 (October 1, 1985, to September 30, 2005) collected on the Rio Grande and its main tributary, the Rio Chama, by various Federal and State agencies to provide a comprehensive overview of water quality in the Rio Grande basin upstream of Albuquerque.

The study area, comprising the Rio Grande and the Rio Chama in central and northern New Mexico (figs. 1 and 2), includes water-quality stations from the USGS (fig. 1 and table 1), the Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL; fig. 1 and table 2), the New Mexico Environment Department (NMED; fig. 2 and table 3), and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS; fig. 2 and table 4). Previous investigations have analyzed water samples for a wide range of constituents including physical properties, major ions, trace elements, nutrients, various radionuclides, and various organic compounds including explosives, herbicides, pesticides, volatile organic compounds, and pharmaceuticals. 2 Selected Investigations and Statistical Summary of Surface-Water Quality, North-Central New Mexico, 1985\u20132007 blw Cochiti (USGS) Cochiti (USGS) 1 Cochiti (USGS) 2 Cochiti (USGS) 3 Cochiti (USGS) 5 Cochiti (USGS) 4 White Rock (LANL) White Rock (USGS) Mortandad (LANL) Mortendad (USGS) Otowi (USGS) Otowi bridge Otowi, width Otowi, bank S C creek upper Otowi, bank Santa Clara (USGS) San Juan Chamita, bank Chamita (LANL) Chamita (USGS) Taos Junction (USGS) Embudo, bank Embudo (LANL) Albuquerque metropolitan area Sandia Pueblo Cochiti Reservoir Embudo (USGS) Abiquiu Reservoir SANDOVAL SANTA FE BERNALILLO LOS ALAMOS TAOS RIO ARRIBA TORRANCE Los Alamos National Laboratory Rio Grande Rio Chama T Rio Bravo at Alameda Albuquerque near Alameda Abiquiu (USGS) Bernalillo (USGS) San Felipe (USGS) Frijoles Bernalillo (LANL) Frijoles, bank Frijoles, width Cochiti (LANL) 4 Cochiti (LANL) 3 Cochiti (LANL) 2 Cochiti (LANL) 1 blw Cochiti (LANL) 106\u00b00' 106\u00b030' 36\u00b00' 35\u00b030' 35\u00b00' EXPLANATION U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) water-quality station name (table 1) Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) water-quality station name (table 2) 0 5 10 MILES Base from U.S. Geological Survey digital data, 1999, 1:100,000 County line derived from the U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of the Census, 1994, TIGER/Line files, digital data, 1:100,000 Universal Transverse Mercator Zone 13N projection and North American Datum of 1983 0 5 10 KILOMETERS New Mexico Map area Elephant Butte Reservoir Figure 1.

Data included in this report were collected by the USGS, the LANL, the NMED, and the USFWS. Results of selected water analyses are compared to water-quality standards. The water-quality data included in this report do not represent finished drinking-water samples, and any measured concentration that exceeds a Federal or State standard does not indicate a violation of drinking-water standards. The planned treatment process may reduce or eliminate many constituent concentrations detected in untreated surface-water samples, including bacteria and viruses. Selected Investigations of Surface-Water Quality In 1934, the U.S. Salinity Laboratory initiated a 30-year study to measure the quality of water in the Rio Grande, to determine the salt burden of the Rio Grande, and to calculate the salt-balance conditions along the Rio Grande (Wilcox, 1968). Data were collected during that study by the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, the International Boundary and Water Commission, the USGS, and the U.S. Salinity Laboratory. A summary report was published in 1968 that included data and the calculated salt balances for the Rio Grande from Otowi Bridge, N. Mex., to Fort Quitman, Tex. (Wilcox, 1968). Wilcox (1968) found that the concentration of ions in water typically increased downstream and that salt balances in individual basins generally were positive (more salt entered the basin than was removed) during years of below normal streamflow and generally were negative during years of above normal streamflow. Wilkins (1986) published a report summarizing the results of the Southwest Alluvial basins portion of the USGS Regional Aquifer-System Analysis program. Figures showing average surface-water quality for selected sites on the Rio Grande upstream of Fort Quitman were included and indicated that concentrations of analytes generally increased downstream from the headwaters and that upstream from Albuquerque calcium and bicarbonate were the principal dissolved constituents. In 1992, the USGS National Water-Quality Assessment Program (NAWQA) initiated a series of studies to assess the quality of groundwater and surface water in the Rio Grande Valley from the headwaters to El Paso, Tex. Data on surface- water quality were collected at selected sites"

In 1992, the USGS National Water-Quality Assessment Program (NAWQA) initiated a series of studies to assess the quality of groundwater and surface water in the Rio Grande Valley from the headwaters to El Paso, Tex. Data on surface- water quality were collected at selected sites monthly and during synoptic studies to determine composition of the water and to assess the correlation between land use and surface- water quality. From 1992 to 1995, surface-water samples were collected at numerous locations in the Rio Grande basin and were analyzed for various constituents including trace elements, nutrients, and pesticides. Anderholm and others (1995) summarized available nutrient, suspended sediment, and pesticide data for the Rio Grande from the headwaters to El Paso. They found that nutrient concentrations generally were small upstream of Albuquerque. Surface-water samples were analyzed for a range of chlorinated insecticides and polychlorinated biphenyls, organophosphorus insecticides, and herbicides. Of the 5,192 analyses for individual compounds, 98 percent of the results were censored, and DDT (dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane) and its degradation products (diazinon and 2,4-D) were the most commonly detected pesticides (Anderholm and others, 1995). Carter (1997) presented the results of bed sediment and fish tissue sampling and reported that DDT and DDT-degradation compounds were common in fish tissue but seldom detected in bed sediment. Miller and others (1997) presented data collected during a synoptic study of trace element concentrations in surface water upstream of Albuquerque, and Taylor and others (2001) discussed the results of the sampling. Taylor and others (2001) indicated that runoff from the Creede mining district near the headwaters of the Rio Grande contributed to the concentration of dissolved trace elements in the Rio Grande for a distance of about 100 miles downstream. The Red River mining district did not appear to contribute to the concentration of dissolved trace elements in the Rio Grande. Taylor and others (2001) reported that, with the exception of cadmium at one site near the Creede mining district, no concentration of trace elements exceeded USEPA primary drinking-water standards. Healy (1997) discussed the results of monthly surface-water sampling along the Rio Grande. Healy (1997) found that dissolved-ion concentrations generally increased downstream as the result of natural sources, irrigation-return flow, wastewater treatment plant inflow, and urban runoff. Healy (1997) also noted that five pesticides including diazinon, s-Ethyl dipropylthiocarbamate (EPTC), malathion, simazine, and tebuthiuron were detected Table 4.

Moore and Anderholm (2002) evaluated spatial and temporal variations in dissolved solids, nitrate, total phosphorus, and suspended sediment concentrations and loads; they determined that ion concentration and load generally increase downstream from the New Mexico-Colorado State line as a result of increased streamflow. The USGS, in cooperation with the City of Albuquerque, conducted a study to measure concentrations of dissolved trace elements and calculate instantaneous loads of selected trace elements and other constituents in the Rio Grande (Kelly and Taylor, 1996). Surface-water samples were collected at seven sites on the Rio Grande from near Bernalillo, N. Mex., to upstream of Isleta Diversion Dam, N. Mex., from May to October 1994 (Kelly and Taylor, 1996). Kelly and Taylor (1996) concluded that dissolved concentrations of trace elements generally increased downstream of the Albuquerque Wastewater Treatment Facility, that concentrations of dissolved trace elements did not significantly increase downstream of the effluent channel during periods of high flow, and that concentrations of dissolved trace elements increased downstream from Bernalillo to Isleta Diversion Dam during periods of low flow. Kelly and Taylor (1996) also noted that all measured concentrations were less than New Mexico water-quality standards for water designated as domestic or livestock supply. Eight sites on the Rio Grande from the Pueblo of San Felipe, N. Mex., to Los Lunas, N. Mex., were sampled quarterly from October 1994 to August 1996 as part of a larger study conducted by the USGS. The purpose of that study was to determine ambient concentrations and loads of trace elements in the Rio Grande and to determine the mean concentrations of inorganic and organic forms of arsenic in the edible parts of fish tissue (Wilcox, 1997). Wilcox (1997) determined that dissolved-solids concentrations and dissolved- arsenic concentrations increased downstream from the Rio Grande at San Felipe Pueblo to Los Lunas, that nearly all arsenic measured in the Rio Grande was in the dissolved phase, and that major ion and trace element concentrations generally were greatest in outfall from wastewater treatment facilities. The USGS, in cooperation with other Federal, State, and local agencies, conducted a 6-year (1995\u20132001) study of the Middle Rio Grande basin with the objective of improving the understanding of the hydrology, geology, and land-surface characteristics of the basin (Bartolino and Cole, 2002). Surface-water samples were collected from the Rio Grande, tributaries to the Rio Grande, irrigation canals, and surface drains (Plummer and others, 2004). Plummer and others (2004) concluded that isotopic variations in the Rio Grande are caused by seasonal variation in source waters. Measured tritium concentrations in the Rio Grande at Alameda, N. Mex., ranged from 7.2 to 11 tritium units (TU) and showed a distinct increase in concentration during summer 1997 (Plummer and others, 2004). Major and minor trace element data are further detailed in Plummer and others (2004). The State of New Mexico"

Major and minor trace element data are further detailed in Plummer and others (2004). The State of New Mexico initiated a survey to measure concentrations of pharmaceutical residuals in water from various locations across the State (McQuillan and others, 2002). Water samples were collected from 15 sewage effluent locations, 23 surface-water locations, 9 groundwater locations, and 2 public drinking-water supply systems; these samples were analyzed for various analgesics, anticonvulsants, antidepressants, anti-inflammatory compounds, hormones, antibiotics, caffeine, and tamoxifen (McQuillan and others, 2002). All sewage effluent samples in the Rio Grande watershed above Albuquerque contained at least one drug residue; an antidepressant was detected in a sample collected at Buckman Crossing, and a hormone and esterone were detected downstream of the Albuquerque wastewater treatment facility (McQuillan and others, 2002). Results presented in a USFWS draft report show a small number of volatile organic compounds, pesticides, herbicides, explosives, and pharmaceuticals detected in water samples at levels greater than laboratory reporting limits or method detection (Abeyta and Lusk, 2004). Physical property measurements across channel transects indicated increased variability near the riverbanks, and physical property measurements from continuous monitoring probes indicated diurnal temperature variation and wide variation in specific conductance, dissolved oxygen, and turbidity (Abeyta and Lusk, 2004). In 2000 and 2001, after the Cerro Grande fire near Los Alamos, N. Mex., the USGS collected surface-water samples from the Rio Grande and Cochiti Reservoir to monitor storm runoff events in watersheds affected by the fire. Concentrations of radionuclides including cesium-137, strontium-90, plutonium-238, and plutonium-239/240 measured in the Rio Grande after major storm events in 2001 and 2003 were greater than concentrations measured in base flow (Gallaher and Koch, 2004, p. 156\u2013157). Sediment samples collected from Cochiti Reservoir after the fire indicated increased concentrations of cesium-137, plutonium-238, and plutonium-239 (Gallaher and Koch, 2004). Additional results are summarized in Gallaher and Koch (2004). Langman and Anderholm (2004) described the effects of reservoir installation and operation and the introduction of water from the San Juan-Chama Project (SJCP) on water quality and suspended-sediment concentrations in the Rio Grande and Rio Chama. The authors concluded that extreme streamflow decreased and that median streamflow increased after installation of dams and the addition of water from the SJCP. Langman and Anderholm (2004) also concluded that reservoirs attenuated the water-quality dilution from snowmelt runoff and that the influence of the SJCP and reservoirs diminished downstream. Passell and others (2004, 2005) used water-quality data collected from 1975 to 1999 by the USGS on the Rio Grande to determine spatial and temporal trends for specific 10 Selected Investigations and Statistical Summary of Surface-Water Quality, North-Central New Mexico, 1985\u20132007 conductance; total dissolved solids; pH; major ions including calcium, magnesium, sodium, potassium, chloride, fluoride, sulfate, bicarbonate, and silicate; and nutrients including total organic carbon, ammonium plus organic nitrogen, ammonium, nitrate plus nitrite, phosphorus, and orthophosphate. The water-quality data were collected as part of the USGS\u2019s National Stream Quality Accounting Network (NASQAN) and NAWQA. Temporal trends generally indicated improved quality of the water over time likely because of improved water treatment (Passell and others, 2004, 2005). Seasonal variation in water quality was correlated with seasonal variation in discharge, suggesting that improved water quality was partially caused by dilution from increased discharge (Passell and others, 2004, 2005). Spatial trends indicated that pH, major ion, and nutrient concentrations increased downstream of Albuquerque and likely were affected by effluent discharge, by river geomorphology, and possibly by discharge of saline groundwater to the river (Passell and others, 2004, 2005). In 2002 and 2003, the LANL conducted a study of polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) concentrations in the Rio Grande upstream and downstream of the laboratory boundary (Gonzalez and Montoya, 2005). Samples were collected by using semipermeable membrane devices. PCB concentrations in the Rio Grande upstream of Cochiti Reservoir were less than concentrations downstream of the reservoir, and PCB concentrations were similar upstream and downstream of the laboratory boundary (Gonzalez and Montoya, 2005). The report concluded that the LANL did not contribute to PCB concentrations in the Rio Grande during the sampling periods. Langman and Nolan (2005) characterized streamflow and water-quality trends of the Rio Grande and Rio Chama during WYs 1985 to 2002 and concluded that streamflow in the Rio Grande and Rio Chama follows seasonal and climatic patterns and that water quality generally decreases downstream as indicated by an increase in specific conductance downstream. Langman and Nolan (2005) determined that water quality in the Rio Grande and the Rio Chama was affected by reservoir management and groundwater inflows. The authors noted that median concentrations of trace elements and maximum concentrations of radionuclides and anthropogenic compounds did not exceed drinking-water standards (Langman and Nolan, 2005). 2007 Investigations of Surface-Water Quality The USGS, in cooperation with the ABCWUA, conducted several investigations on the Rio Grande and its tributaries in 2007. Water samples were collected at four sites on the Rio Grande, at one site on the Rio Chama, and at one site on the Jemez River to evaluate water-quality trends and determine concentrations of selected trace elements, organic compounds, and radionuclides. Samples were collected three times per year at the sites on the Rio Grande and Rio Chama and once per year on the Jemez River. Continuous specific conductance and water temperature were measured at three sites on the Rio Grande and at three sites on the Rio Chama to determine short-term water-quality variations and the effects of snowmelt and summer thunderstorm runoff, operation of reservoirs, and the introduction of SJCP water on water quality. Water-quality profiles were measured in Abiquiu and Cochiti Reservoirs"

Water-quality profiles were measured in Abiquiu and Cochiti Reservoirs to determine variations in water quality throughout those reservoirs. Data were evaluated to determine travel times in the Rio Grande downstream from Cochiti Reservoir. Statistical Summary of Selected Surface-Water-Quality Data The surface-water-quality data compiled for this report\u2014collected by the USGS, the LANL, the NMED, and the USFWS\u2014either were requested from the collecting agency or were obtained from an agency-supported database. Data that were not relevant to the study were removed; these data included those for sites outside the study area, sites that were not located on the main stem of the Rio Grande or the Rio Chama, samples that were collected before WY 1985 or after WY 2005, samples of media other than water, and quality-control samples such as blanks and replicates. Additional filtering criteria (detailed below) differed for each database. The authors assumed that each agency had reviewed their data prior to release; thus, the data compiled for this report were not reviewed for accuracy or correctness by the authors, and no attempt was made by the authors to evaluate quality-control samples. The USGS has collected data as part of various Federal, State, and municipal projects with the focus of long-term monitoring of water quality. Data collection included many water-resources and water-quality studies conducted in cooperation with the City of Albuquerque and ABCWUA. Data were collected by following protocols outlined in the USGS National Field Manual for the Collection of Water- Quality Data (U.S. Geological Survey, variously dated), and water-quality constituents were analyzed by following the USGGS National Water Quality Laboratory, Denver, Colo., procedure outlined in the USGS Techniques of Water- Resources Investigations Book 5: Laboratory Analysis (U.S. Geological Survey, variously dated) Details of individual studies are provided herein in the section \u201cSelected Investigations of Surface-Water Quality.\u201d Data collected by the USGS were retrieved from the National Water Information System (NWIS) on December 28, 2006, by hydrologic unit code (HUC) for the Rio Grande and the Rio Chama including HUCs 13020101, 13020102, and 13020201 through 13020211. Data that were removed included data that were not relevant to the study, results that were flagged as erroneous, and invalid data such as negative or zero values for analytes other than radionuclides (which can have negative values). Analytes determined by Statistical Summary of Selected Surface-Water-Quality Data 11 multiple methods (alkalinity or acid-neutralizing capacity and bicarbonate) were combined. All sites located on Cochiti Reservoir were combined. The LANL has established an environmental surveillance program that includes annual sampling of water, air, and soil in areas possibly affected by laboratory activities. As part of the annual surveillance, the LANL collects surface-water samples on the Rio Grande and Rio Chama upstream of the laboratory boundary to characterize regional background conditions and downstream of the laboratory boundary to characterize the effect of laboratory activities on regional surface-water quality (Los Alamos National Laboratory, 2005). Water-quality samples (generally dip samples collected from the bank) are analyzed for a variety of constituents including general chemistry, major ions, trace elements, radionuclides, and a range of organic compounds including explosives (Los Alamos National Laboratory, 2005). Results from environmental monitoring at the LANL are published in an annual report that characterizes environmental management performance, summarizes environmental occurrences and responses, demonstrates compliance with applicable standards, and emphasizes significant programs and efforts (Los Alamos National Laboratory, 2005). Water-quality data collected by the LANL were obtained from the Sandia Tritium workbook in the Oracle Discoverer interface of the LANL Water Quality Database, accessed at http://wqdbworld.lanl.gov/ on November 26, 2006. Data were retrieved for relevant surface-water sites (location type code \u201cWCS\u201d described as Watercourse) on the Rio Grande and Rio Chama and all sites on Cochiti Reservoir. Data that were removed included data that were not relevant to the study, results for which the method detection limit was greater than the reported result, results that did not indicate whether the sample was filtered or unfiltered, results that were flagged as erroneous, and invalid data such as negative or zero values for analytes other than radionuclides (which can have negative values). All sites located on Cochiti Reservoir were combined. The NMED Surface Water Quality Bureau (SWQB), under the New Mexico Water Quality Act and the Federal Clean Water Act, established monitoring programs to assess the quality of surface water, to develop and update water- quality standards and discharge permits, to identify and prioritize water-quality problems, to develop total daily maximum load standards, and to assess existing water-quality controls and wetland restoration projects (New Mexico Environment Department, 2006). The monitoring program is rotated among water basins on an 8-year cycle that includes monthly sampling of rivers and streams from spring to fall and seasonal sampling of reservoirs and lakes (New Mexico Environment Department, 2006). Samples are analyzed for parameters that have applicable standards, and selected samples are analyzed for major ions, trace elements, and other toxic substances (New Mexico Environment Department, 2006). Samples are collected by using methods detailed in various SWQB publications (New Mexico Environment Department, 2006). Results from the surveys are described in various reports that are available from the NMED. Water-quality data collected by the NMED were obtained from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) STORET Legacy (Legacy) and Modernized STORET (Modern) databases, accessed at http://www.epa.gov/storet/ dbtop.html on November 17, 2006. Data for Bernalillo, Los Alamos, Rio Arriba, Sandoval, Santa Fe, and Taos Counties were retrieved from the Legacy database, and data for the entire State of New Mexico was retrieved from the Modern database."

Data for Bernalillo, Los Alamos, Rio Arriba, Sandoval, Santa Fe, and Taos Counties were retrieved from the Legacy database, and data for the entire State of New Mexico was retrieved from the Modern database. Data from the Legacy and Modern databases were combined to generate a complete dataset from the NMED. Sample locations were combined by matching station names between the datasets, and analytes were combined by matching parameter names between the datasets. Some analyte matches required conversion of the reported analyte unit to ensure that units matched between databases, and if units were missing, they were determined either from the listed USGS parameter code or from the listed method code. Sample fractions were separated into dissolved and total, which included total, whole, total recoverable, and whole recoverable. Data not relevant to the study were removed. All sites located on Cochiti Reservoir were combined. In 2002, the USFWS began an assessment of the effect of water-quality conditions on the health of the silvery minnow (Hybognathus amarus) in the Middle Rio Grande (Abeyta and Lusk, 2004). Samples were collected from 14 sites along the Rio Grande between the southern border of Sandia Pueblo and the northern edge of Elephant Butte Reservoir. Field parameters, including water temperature, pH, specific conductance, dissolved oxygen, and turbidity, were measured, and composite samples for laboratory analysis were collected in low-velocity, shallow areas (C. Abeyta, USFWS, written commun., 2007). Filtered samples were analyzed for total dissolved solids, common anions, major ions, trace elements, and perchlorate, and unfiltered samples were analyzed for alkalinity, total suspended solids, hardness, total cyanide, nutrients, biological oxygen demand, chemical oxygen demand, and organic compounds including volatile organic compounds, pesticides, herbicides, explosives, and pharmaceuticals. Data collected by the USFWS were provided by the agency in a spreadsheet of water-quality data associated with a draft report (Abeyta and Lusk, 2004). Data not relevant to the study were removed. Nonparametric statistical methods, which are dependent on the relative position of numerically ranked data (Helsel, 2005), were applied to calculate summary statistics. Summary statistics\u2014including median and maximum concentrations, the number of samples analyzed, and the percentage of values that were censored\u2014were calculated for all constituents for which two or more values were available. Most of the available data were values that are less than a threshold value and are imprecisely known and denoted as censored (Helsel, 2005). The data obtained from the USGS, the LANL, and the NMED denoted censored data with a 12 Selected Investigations and Statistical Summary of Surface-Water Quality, North-Central New Mexico, 1985\u20132007 qualifier code that indicated that the reported value was the threshold value. The data obtained from the USFWS denoted censored data by alteration of the reported value to indicate that the measured value was less than the associated reporting limit. All values that were less than or equal to the largest censored value for that constituent were raised to the largest censored value for statistical analysis. Estimated values (measured values that are equal to or less than a threshold value) indicated that the analyte was present in the sample but that the actual concentration is imprecisely known. Estimated values in all databases were indicated by a qualifier code. The concentrations of estimated values were assumed to equal the estimated value for statistical analysis. In general, analysis methods for radionuclides differ from methods for organic and inorganic constituents. Radionuclides are quantified by measuring the rate of radioactive decay, and the uncertainty of the measured value is a function of the length of time that is monitored for decay. The minimum detectable concentration (the minimum concentration required to give a specified probability that an analyte is present in a sample, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, 2004, p. 20\u20136) determines the threshold for censoring a value. For this report, the databases did not provide the required information to define the threshold values and did not consistently designate censored data. Therefore, the reported values for radionuclides were assumed to be absolute concentrations unless the constituent was qualified as censored. Results from analyses for radionuclides can be expressed in units of concentration (\u00b5g/L), activity (pCi/L or \u00b5Ci/mL), or exposure (millirems). The conversion from units of concentration or activity to units of exposure is dependent on factors such as body mass, radionuclide species, and the amount of radionuclide consumed. In addition, given the same concentration or activity, different radionuclides would contribute different levels of exposure to the final exposure value. Because of the complexities, the equivalent exposure for the reported concentrations or activities of radionuclides are not presented in this report. Results of selected water analyses are compared to (1) national drinking-water standards promulgated by the USEPA including primary standards (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2007a) and secondary standards (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2007b); (2) health-based screening levels (HBSL) developed by the USGS, USEPA, Oregon Health and Science University (OSHU), and the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP; U.S. Geological Survey, 2007); (3) human-health screening levels for tapwater developed by the USEPA (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2007c); and (4) derived concentration guide (DCG) reference values for operational U.S. Department of Energy (USDOE) facilities developed by the USDOE (U.S. Department of Energy, 2007). The comparison is useful to evaluate the suitability of surface water for municipal supply. Because the water-quality data for radionuclides were reported in units of concentration or activity, standards for radionuclides reported in units of exposure were not included in the comparison. Primary drinking-water standards established by the USEPA (table 5) are either maximum contaminant levels or treatment techniques and are legally enforceable limits on concentrations of specific contaminants known to adversely affect human health (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2011)."

The comparison is useful to evaluate the suitability of surface water for municipal supply. Because the water-quality data for radionuclides were reported in units of concentration or activity, standards for radionuclides reported in units of exposure were not included in the comparison. Primary drinking-water standards established by the USEPA (table 5) are either maximum contaminant levels or treatment techniques and are legally enforceable limits on concentrations of specific contaminants known to adversely affect human health (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2011). Standards are the lowest concentration of a contaminant that can be achieved in drinking water with the best available and economically feasible technology and treatment techniques and are generally established with the objective of attaining the maximum contaminant level goal (the maximum concentration of a contaminant that does not cause adverse health effects, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2011). Secondary drinking-water standards established by the USEPA (table 6) are non-enforceable guidelines for contaminants that may affect the cosmetic or aesthetic quality of the water (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2011). The USGS, in cooperation with the USEPA, OHSU, and the NJDEP, developed HBSLs (table 7) to provide a context for interpretation of water-quality data for compounds with no existing drinking-water standards (Toccalino and others, 2003). Toccalino and others (2003) detailed the methods used to determine HBSLs, and Toccalino (2007) summarized revisions to the methodology used to determine HBSLs. The USEPA Region 6 developed screening levels (table 8) on the basis of fixed levels of risk associated with contaminant concentrations in soil, air, and water to aid in the process of closure and realignment of surplus military property (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2007c, 2007d). The USDOE DCG reference values (table 9) are the concentrations of radionuclides at which continuous exposure for 1 year by a single mode (ingestion of water, submersion in air, or inhalation) would result in an effective dose equivalent of 100 millirems. The values were established to limit exposure of the public to radiation from USDOE facilities and activities to the lowest achievable level and to control radioactive contamination of the environment to the extent practical (U.S. Department of Energy, 2007).

As of January 1, 2002, turbidity may never exceed 1 NTU and must not exceed 0.3 NTU in 95 percent of daily samples in any month. 2 Lead and copper are regulated by a treatment technique that requires systems to control the corrosiveness of their water. If more than 10 percent of tapwater samples exceed the action level, water systems must take additional steps. For copper, the action level is 1.3 mg/L, and for lead the action level is 0.015 mg/L. 3 More than 5.0 percent samples total coliform-positive in a month. (For water systems that collect fewer than 40 routine samples per month, no more than one sample can be total coliform-positive per month.) Every sample that has total coliform must be analyzed for either fecal coliforms or E. coli. In a system, if two consecutive samples are total coliform positive\u2014one of which is also positive for E. coli fecal coliforms\u2014then the system has an acute MCL violation. 4 Each water system must certify, in writing, to the State (using third-party or manufacturer\u2019s certification) that, when acrylamide and epichlorohydrin are used in drinking-water systems, the combination (or product) of dose and monomer level does not exceed the levels specified, as follows: Acrylamide = 0.05 percent dosed at 1 mg/L (or equivalent) and Epichlorohydrin = 0.01 percent dosed at 20 mg/L (or equivalent). 5 Maximum residual disinfectant level (MRDL)\u2014The highest level of a disinfectant allowed in drinking water. There is convincing evidence that addition of a disinfectant is necessary for control of microbial contaminants. 6 Maximum residual disinfectant level goal (MRDLG)\u2014The level of a drinking-water disinfectant below which there is no known or expected risk to health. MRDLGs do not reflect the benefits of the use of disinfectants to control microbial contaminants. 7 Although there is no collective MCLG for this contaminant group, there are individual MCLGs for some of the individual contaminants: Trihalomethanes: bromodichloromethane (zero); bromoform (zero); dibromochloromethane (0.06 mg/L). Chloroform is regulated with this group but has no MCLG. Haloacetic acids: dichloroacetic acid (zero); trichloroacetic acid (0.3 mg/L). Monochloroacetic acid, bromoacetic acid, and dibromoacetic acid are regulated with this group but have no MCLGs. 8 MCLGs were not established before the 1986 Amendments to the Safe Drinking Water Act. Therefore, there is no MCLG for this contaminant. 16 Selected Investigations and Statistical Summary of Surface-Water Quality, North-Central New Mexico, 1985\u20132007 Table 6.
