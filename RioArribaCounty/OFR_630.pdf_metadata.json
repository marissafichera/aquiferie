The primary goal of this study was to characterize the local and regional aquifers that currently supply local communities for domestic and municipal use. The study focused on the communities of Chama, Dixon, Abiquiu, Medanales, and El Rito. While surface water is primarily used for irrigation and farming, groundwater is the primary water source for domestic and municipal use for households, institutions, and businesses, supplied by a community system or private domestic wells. Most wells in these communities produce water from shallow alluvial aquifers that are composed of unconsolidated gravel, sand, and clay. These shallow aquifers generally offer convenient (shallow depth to water) and good-quality water but may be susceptible to contamination from the surface and changes related to variations in surface water. These communities have experienced water shortages during drought conditions when decreased amounts of rain and snow in the recharge areas (high elevations in nearby mountains) result in decreased recharge to the shallow alluvial aquifers. Drought conditions greatly affect surface water supply, causing an increase in water demand and, therefore, an increase in groundwater pumping. The combination of decreased recharge and increased groundwater pumping can result in water levels in wells dropping below the pump, rendering the wells nonfunctional for a period of time. Therefore, as the climate warms, resulting in overall less recharge and increased evaporation, it is vital to characterize these shallow alluvial aquifers, as well as evaluate deeper aquifer systems and how the different aquifers interact with each other and the surface water system. As part of this initial phase of study, depth to water was measured in 90 wells, and water samples were collected from 63 of these wells. All samples were analyzed for major cations and anions, trace metals, stable isotopes of water (oxygen and hydrogen), and bacteria. A subset of 25 samples was analyzed for carbon-14 and tritium (3H),"

All samples were analyzed for major cations and anions, trace metals, stable isotopes of water (oxygen and hydrogen), and bacteria. A subset of 25 samples was analyzed for carbon-14 and tritium (3H), which were used to assess the age of the groundwater. Other data used in this study, including well depth, depth to water, and water chemistry, were obtained from well records at the New Mexico Office of the State Engineer and other state agencies. Shallow alluvial aquifers in these communities underlie the valley bottoms and are composed of sediments deposited by the local stream or river. The accumulated sediments that make up the shallow alluvial aquifers sit on top of older rocks or sediments of lower permeability, such as clay, shale, or a crystalline rock like granite. This low-permeability boundary is essentially the \u201cfloor\u201d or bottom of the shallow alluvial aquifer that acts as a barrier to vertical water flow, effectively defining shallow and deep aquifer systems with limited hydrologic connection. The deep aquifer systems are more difficult to characterize because significantly fewer wells are completed in them. The shallow alluvial aquifers in all communities of interest are hydrologically connected to the surface water system. Shallow groundwater generally flows parallel to the local river or stream and moves from the aquifer to the stream or vice versa, depending on local hydrologic conditions. Depth-to-water measurements and total well depths from well records were used to estimate saturated thicknesses for local shallow alluvial aquifers. The average estimated saturated thickness for shallow E X E C U T I V E S U M M A R Y viii O P E N - F I L E R E P O R T 6 3 0 : E V A L U A T I O N O F G R O U N D W A T E R R E S O U R C E S F O R C O M M U N I T I E S I N R I O A R R I B A C O U N T Y alluvial aquifers in the Abiquiu Valley (Abiquiu, Medanales, and El Rito) and the Dixon area was 11 m (36 ft). The estimated average saturated thickness of the shallow alluvial aquifer in the Chama area was 6.7 m (22 ft). The shallow alluvial aquifer in the El Rito area had the largest estimated saturated thickness, greater than 20 m (66 ft). Groundwater produced from these shallow alluvial aquifers was mostly of good quality, with total dissolved solids concentrations of less than 500 mg/L. However, some wells completed in shallow alluvial aquifers\u2014particularly in the communities of Chama, El Rito, Abiquiu, and Medanales\u2014tested positive for total coliform bacteria, which is likely due to contamination from septic tanks. Water produced by some wells completed in the deep aquifer system in the Chama and Dixon areas had arsenic concentrations that were significantly higher than the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency maximum contaminant level. Water chemistry and age dating data indicate that the shallow alluvial aquifers are recharged mainly by snowmelt and rain in nearby mountains, with ages ranging from tens to a few hundreds of years old. In contrast, groundwater produced from the deeper aquifer systems exhibits a wide range of total dissolved solids concentrations, from hundreds to thousands of mg/L, along with much older ages (up to tens of thousands of years old). There is some evidence that groundwater from the deep aquifer systems can move upward into the shallow alluvial aquifer systems via faults and fractures. While the shallow alluvial aquifers produce good-quality water for municipal and domestic uses, these aquifers are relatively thin and have limited storage. These shallow aquifers, with young waters, are highly susceptible to shallow contamination (such as septic systems) and can change quickly due to drought, surface water flow changes, or impacts of climate change. Deep regional aquifer systems are characterized by more variable water quality that comes with longer, deeper flow paths. These deep regional aquifer systems may be more stable in the long term, with less variability in water quantity.

This water has historically been used for subsistence farming in the valley bottoms. Today, this surface water is primarily used to irrigate an estimated 25,370 acres of land (La Calandria Associates, Inc., 2006), mainly for forage crop production and residential yard and garden space. In addition, surface water in the Rio Chama watershed is enjoyed by hunters, anglers, hikers, and boaters. The ability to divert this surface water for additional uses is limited by the Rio Grande Compact, which carefully controls new water rights applications to ensure downstream surface water users receive their allocations. Almost all other water uses beyond agriculture rely on groundwater supplies. Groundwater is the principal water source for municipal and domestic use in households, institutions, and businesses in the region. Many small communities in Rio Arriba County have experienced problems with their groundwater supply in terms of quantity and quality (La Calandria Associates, Inc., 2006) and have valid concerns about their future water supply. While some research on the hydrogeology of this area has been conducted, much more work is needed to better understand local and regional groundwater systems. Most small communities in Rio Arriba County use groundwater for domestic and municipal uses, not only due to legal and political limits on the surface water supply but also because of the monetary costs associated with treating surface water supplies. Groundwater supplies that are not in direct communication with surface water are generally more cost-effective sources because they typically do not contain fecal coliform and have very low turbidity. However, due to the regional geology of the Rio Arriba County area, many communities have had difficulty finding a good-quality, reliable community groundwater source (La Calandria Associates, Inc., 2006). Many communities, such as El Rito and Abiquiu, have used a variety of water sources, including collection galleries, hand-dug wells, springs, and wells tapping deeper aquifers. Shallow hand-dug wells and collection galleries tend to dry up during short-term and long-term droughts. Unfortunately, finding a deep groundwater source that produces good-quality water at adequate pumping rates to supply a community has proven very difficult. Currently, the community of Chama uses surface water from the Rio Chama because a previously used spring effectively dried up, and deep groundwater in the area tends to have quality issues such as high arsenic concentrations. As the climate continues to change, these water supply issues will likely worsen. All surface water and groundwater in New Mexico originates as rain or snow, most of which is returned to the atmosphere by plant transpiration and evaporation (together called evapotranspiration). Some water runs off into local or regional streams, and some water recharges local or regional aquifers that eventually discharge into streams and rivers; however, the amount of groundwater recharge represents a small percentage compared to the total precipitation (Phillips and Thomson, 2022). As the average temperature continues to increase over the next 50 years, researchers predict evapotranspiration rates will increase, likely resulting in decreases in groundwater recharge and streamflow (Phillips and Thomson, 2022). Decreased streamflow and groundwater recharge will have a negative impact on water supplies for many communities in Rio Arriba County that are already experiencing water shortages. 2 O P E N - F I L E R E P O R T 6 3 0 : E V A L U A T I O N O F G R O U N D W A T E R R E S O U R C E S F O R C O M M U N I T I E S I N R I O A R R I B A C O U N T Y 37\u00b0 36\u00b030' -106\u00b0 -106\u00b030' 0000 404 0000 400 0000 40 0000 36 Dixon Dixon Chama Chama El Rito El Rito Abiquiu Abiquiu Medanales Medanales RIO ARRIBA COUNTY RIO ARRIBA COUNTY TAOS COUNTY TAOS COUNTY Bra zos Cli \ufb00s Bra zos Cli \ufb00s R io G r a nd e Rio C h a m a Heron Reservoir Abiquiu Reservoir El Vado Lake 285 84 64 NM-08279000 NM-08279000 NM-08288000 NM-08288000 NM-08287000 NM-08287000 NM-08284100 NM-08284100 NM-08281400 NM-08281400 D I X O N D I X O N C H A M A C H A M A A B I Q U I U A B I Q U I U"

This report summarizes the first year of a project that was funded for the state fiscal year 2023\u20132024. Additional funding for two more fiscal years will continue this regional study, and this work will be updated and revised. This study was conducted by the New Mexico Bureau of Geology and Mineral Resources (NMBGMR), a research and service division of New Mexico Tech. The objectives of this study were to: 1. compile existing literature and hydrogeologic data for local communities of interest and surrounding areas in Rio Arriba County; 2. characterize local shallow alluvial aquifers that currently supply communities for domestic and municipal use, including geologic, hydrogeologic, and geochemical (water quality) characterization; 3. identify and assess deeper aquifer systems that also contribute to the groundwater supply; and 4. identify data gaps and clearly recommend future research needed to fill these gaps so water managers and communities can make well-informed decisions about their future water security. The results of the first phase of this hydrogeologic study are reported in Chapters 2\u20134; each chapter focuses on the communities in the three study areas. Online data tables are available as appendices at https://geoinfo.nmt.edu/publications/openfile/ details.cfml?Volume=630. Each chapter of this report concludes with recommendations for future research in these regions. STUDY AREA NMBGMR\u2019s research team focused on the communities of Chama, Abiquiu, El Rito, Medanales, and Dixon (Fig. 1.1). Except for Dixon, these communities are located in the Rio Chama watershed, which makes up more than half of Rio Arriba County (around 3,157 mi2) and is bounded by the San Juan Mountains to the north (in Colorado), the Tusas Mountains to the east, and the Jemez Mountains to the south. To the west, a relatively low-elevation surface water divide separates the Rio Chama watershed from the San Juan Basin. The Rio Chama drains these surrounding mountains and discharges into the Rio Grande just north of Espa\u00f1ola. Chama, Abiquiu, and Medanales are located along the Rio Chama, and El Rito is located near El Rito Creek, which drains into the Rio Chama between Abiquiu and Medanales. Dixon is located on the east side of the Rio Grande along Embudo Creek, which drains a large area of the Sangre de Cristo Mountains to the southeast. Shallow Alluvial Aquifers Residents of these communities rely on groundwater they pump from shallow alluvial aquifers, which are typically made up of unconsolidated gravel, sand, silt, and clay. A conceptual model of a shallow alluvial aquifer is shown in Figure 1.2. The alluvial aquifers in these communities underlie valley bottoms and are composed of sediments deposited by the local stream or river (Rio Chama for Chama, Abiquiu, and Medanales; El Rito Creek for El Rito; and Embudo Creek for the Dixon area). The accumulation of sediments that make up the shallow alluvial aquifers in the study areas ranges in thickness from 5 to 50 m (16.4\u2013150 ft) and sits on top of rocks or sediments of lower permeability, such as clay, shale, or a crystalline rock such as granite. This material is essentially the \u201cfloor\u201d or bottom of the shallow alluvial aquifer that acts as a partial to total barrier to vertical water flow, effectively defining shallow and deep aquifer systems with limited hydrologic connection. In this report, we use the term \u201cshallow aquifer system\u201d to refer to groundwater that resides in and flows through the unconsolidated sediments of the shallow alluvial aquifer. The term \u201cdeep aquifer system\u201d refers to groundwater that resides in older rocks underlying these alluvial aquifers. Shallow alluvial aquifers in the study areas are hydrologically connected to the local streams or rivers, meaning water moves from one to the other. Whether water moves from a stream into the aquifer (losing stream) or from the aquifer into a stream (gaining stream) depends on the relative elevations of the water level in the river and the water level of the shallow aquifer or the water table. In arid and semiarid areas such as New Mexico, the distribution of gaining and losing river reaches can change significantly with space and time. Groundwater recharge primarily occurs in mountainous areas, where higher precipitation rates and lower temperatures occur.

Overland runoff during a snowmelt or precipitation event can reach a valley bottom in a matter of hours to days. Beneath the surface, some water moves through pores between unconsolidated grains in drainages that accumulate sediment, reaching the valley bottom on the order of weeks to years. Water may also flow along deeper and longer flow paths through fractures in crystalline rocks or through comparably consolidated and cemented, older sedimentary rocks. For these deep flow paths, groundwater flow may take hundreds to thousands of years to reach the valley bottoms from high-terrain recharge areas (Fig. 1.2). In areas near the headwaters of a river, including those of the Rio Chama, the amount of water moving along subsurface flow paths of varying scales is sufficient to maintain base flow during dry seasons and some droughts. Base flow is the flow rate of a river or stream during seasonal dry periods or longer- term droughts when flow in the river or stream is solely due to groundwater discharge. However, as the stream flows away from the main recharge area, less or even no groundwater contributes to streamflow, resulting in losing stream conditions (meaning the river water level is higher than the water table) in which river water seeps through the streambed and recharges the shallow aquifer (Fig. 1.3). Depending on local flow conditions, the transition zone between a gaining and losing river reach likely changes by moving downstream or upstream during wetter and drier conditions, respectively. A shallow alluvial aquifer temporarily stores water that was recharged by the river under losing conditions and discharges water to the river or stream during gaining conditions. Figure 1.2. Conceptual model of a structural basin filled with sediments that compose a layered aquifer system. The shallow alluvial aquifer\u2014the shallowest aquifer shown\u2014is hydrologically connected to the river at the valley bottom. In this scenario, a sedimentary rock aquitard inhibits groundwater flow between the alluvial aquifer and the deep sedimentary rock aquifer. 5 C H A P T E R 1 : H Y D R O G E O L O G I C S T U D Y I N R I O A R R I B A C O U N T Y B A Losing stream Gaining stream \ufb02ow direction \ufb02ow direction water table water table shallow aquifer unsaturated zone unsaturated zone Figure 1.3. Diagrams illustrating interactions between the shallow aquifer and a stream. (A) For a gaining stream, groundwater discharges to the stream. (B) For a losing stream, water from the stream recharges the shallow alluvial aquifer. Modified from Winter et al. (1998). The amount of water stored and the length of time it is stored depend on the size of the aquifer (its width and thickness), the volume of pore spaces in the aquifer (its porosity), and its permeability\u2014a measure of the ability of water to move through pore spaces in aquifer material. Permeability in unconsolidated sediments is generally related to grain size. Water moves quickly in gravel and coarse sand, which are characterized by high permeability. Low-permeability sediments include smaller grains such as silt or clay. These alluvial aquifers provide convenient, shallow access to good-quality groundwater with low concentrations of dissolved minerals. However, shallow aquifer systems are susceptible to contamination from the surface. Many shallow alluvial aquifers are quite thin, limiting the amount of water they can store. Significant amounts of clay are present in some shallow alluvial aquifers, which decreases the permeability or ability of water to move through pore spaces. Therefore, it is important to characterize shallow alluvial aquifers to the extent possible to evaluate them as potential water supplies for communities under current and future climate conditions. Deep Aquifer Systems While the majority of wells registered with the New Mexico Office of the State Engineer (NMOSE) in the study area produce water from shallow alluvial aquifers, some wells in all three community study areas produce water from older rocks that underlie the alluvial aquifer. While data are scarce, it appears that many wells produce good-quality water from the deep aquifer systems.

Initial examination of the deep aquifer system in all three community study areas suggests that these complex systems may reflect mixing of water from unique sources or different depths. Such mixing may be facilitated by upwelling of water in fault or fracture zones in cemented sedimentary rocks or crystalline rocks. Alternatively, faults may juxtapose different rock layers in less consolidated strata. If the fault zone is incompletely sealed by fault-zone clay gouge or fault-zone cementation, groundwater may flow between permeable stratigraphic layers across the fault. Water in these deeper formations is typically much older than water in the shallow aquifers and has had more time to dissolve minerals from the host rock into the aquifer and to interact with these minerals. Much more research is needed to understand these deep hydrologic systems before we can evaluate these aquifers as potential community water supplies. Regional Geologic Differences The following discussion about regional geology is very general and points out important geologic differences among regions. A more detailed geologic description of the different aquifers in this study is presented in subsequent chapters. The regional geologic framework, including lithology and structural geometry, greatly influences many hydrogeologic parameters, such as groundwater flow direction, velocity, and residence time, which strongly affect groundwater chemistry. The communities of El Rito, Abiquiu, Medanales (together referred to as the Abiquiu Valley), and Dixon are located in the Espa\u00f1ola Basin (Fig. 1.1), one of the major Rio Grande rift basins. For these communities, the deep aquifer system is primarily composed of Santa Fe Group rocks, which are generally sandstones, siltstones, and clay deposited between 27 and 10 million years ago by paleodrainages flowing to the south-southwest and south-southeast (Ekas et al., 1984; Ingersoll et al., 1990; Smith, 2004; Koning et al., 2011a, 2011b). While the rocks just below the shallow alluvial aquifer are largely Santa Fe Group rocks for both the Abiquiu Valley and the Dixon area, the underlying geology is very different between these two areas. Rocks underlying the Santa Fe Group in the Abiquiu Valley include a thick (up to 500 m [1,640 ft]) sequence of older sedimentary rocks (sandstones, siltstones, and limestones), ranging in age from about 300 to 27 million years old. These older sedimentary rocks overlie Proterozoic granites and schist, which are 1.7 to 1.4 billion years old and usually do not make good aquifers. In contrast, in the Dixon area, these Proterozoic rocks are located directly beneath Santa Fe Group rocks and are less than 200 m (656 ft) below the surface. The shallow occurrence of Proterozoic rocks in this area is due to ancient tectonic uplift that occurred east of Abiquiu 70 to 50 million years ago, which eroded away 300- to 17-million-year-old strata between the Santa Fe Group and Proterozoic rocks. Although Chama is also located in the Rio Chama watershed, which drains water into the Rio Grande, the geology in the area is not influenced by Rio Grande rift faulting and deposition (i.e., Santa Fe Group rocks are not present). Rather, surficial rocks at higher elevations and rocks underlying the shallow alluvial aquifer in valley bottoms include shales, sandstones, and siltstones that range in age from 250 to 90 million years old. These geologic differences have implications for finding potentially new groundwater sources in these areas. METHODS AND DATA DESCRIPTIONS To achieve the study objectives stated above, we initially compiled existing groundwater, well, and surface water data, including well locations, groundwater levels, and water quality. Well records from NMOSE were filtered to include only wells with an estimated depth-to-water measurement at the time the wells were drilled. In addition, we measured depth to water in 91 wells and collected water samples from 65 wells in the study regions (Fig. 1.4). These water samples were analyzed for different parameters, including general chemistry, trace metals, stable isotopes, and bacteria. A subset of samples was analyzed for carbon-14 and tritium to estimate the age of the water. Groundwater Levels Groundwater levels are the primary datasets for hydrologic research. Measurements of groundwater levels are made in wells, usually as the depth to water or the distance between the ground surface and the top of the water surface in the well. 7 C H A P T E R 1 : H Y D R O G E O L O G I C S T U D Y I N R I O A R R I B A C O U N T Y RIO ARRIBA CO TAOS CO 68 75 \u00a3 \u00a4 84 \u00a3 \u00a4 64,84 Dixon study area Abiquiu Valley study area Chama study area R io G r a n d e Rio Chama R io C h ama Abiquiu Abiquiu Dixon Dixon Chama Chama El Rito El Rito Medanales Medanales \u00a3 \u00a4 84 0 1 mile 0 1 mile 0 1 mile county study area water quality sampled stream inventoried well road NMOSE registered well town Dixon Chama Abiquiu TAOS CO RIO ARRIBA CO MORA CO SANDOVAL CO Ri o C ha m a R i o Gr an de 84 Figure 1.4.

These data are very useful for evaluating hydraulic gradients and groundwater flow directions. In this study, depth-to-water measurements were very useful for determining whether a well was producing water from the shallow alluvial aquifer or the deep aquifer system. Many areas had enough depth-to-water data for the shallow alluvial aquifer to construct water-table maps, which are basically topographical maps of the surface of the shallow alluvial aquifer (the water table). Data for the registered wells shown in Figure 1.4 were acquired from the NMOSE (2024) website (refer to Appendix C of this report). Data such as depth-to-water measurements and total well depth were extracted from drillers\u2019 notes and well records and were used to identify and characterize the shallow alluvial aquifer in the study area. Interpretations of these data are complicated by the fact that the depth-to-water measurements were taken at different times over the last 75 years. Additionally, the quality of the drillers\u2019 measurements is unknown. However, general spatial trends in depth to water can be observed and provide helpful information for delineating different aquifers. Also, in many areas, well density was high enough to evaluate the local water table, even with high uncertainties associated with the data. Water-table maps constructed from these data for these areas are presented in the following sections of this report. Assuming the total depth of a well is the bottom or effective floor of the aquifer, subtracting depth to water from total well depth yields the saturated thickness of the aquifer; this is the thickness of alluvial sediments that are saturated with water, meaning the pore spaces between grains are completely full of water. We present maps showing the spatial distribution of saturated thickness for the shallow alluvial aquifers in the three study areas. As part of the inventory process, most depth-to- water measurements collected as part of this study were measured with a steel tape. We applied chalk on the first 6 m (20 ft) of the tape, which was washed off by the groundwater when the tape reached the surface of the water in the well. The distance between the water line in the chalk and the surface is the depth to water. Other data were also collected during inventory, including the GPS locations of the wells and the heights of well casings visible above ground. Estimated Yield Groundwater is extracted by a pump through a well. As a well is being pumped, the water level in the well goes down; this decrease in water level in the well during pumping is called drawdown. The rate of drawdown depends on aquifer permeability and pumping rate. For highly permeable sediments such as gravel, high pumping rates in the hundreds of gallons per minute (gpm) result in low drawdown rates because water easily moves through the large pore spaces in the gravel. However, in materials of low permeability such as siltstone or clayey sand, pumping rates as low as 1 to 2 gpm can result in very large drawdowns very quickly. The estimated yield, which is included in some well records, is a rough estimate by the drillers of the pumping rate at which drawdown will not cause the water level in the well to drop below the pump during extended periods of pumping. Estimated yields for wells in the different aquifer systems in the study areas are discussed below. Water Chemistry It is very important to test groundwater for dissolved constituents, both inorganic and organic, because some constituents (natural and anthropogenic) at certain concentrations may be harmful to human health. In addition, from a hydrogeologic perspective, the concentrations and relative distributions of dissolved minerals provide important information about what type of rocks the water has come in contact with along its flow path and possibly how long the water has been in the subsurface.

(2013) described the sampling methods we used in detail. Water Quality and Drinking Water Standards In each chapter of this report, we refer to two different drinking water standards established by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA; 2024). The primary maximum contaminant levels (MCLs), as defined by the EPA, were established to protect against consumption of drinking water contaminants that present a risk to human health. Drinking water MCLs are legally enforceable standards that apply 9 C H A P T E R 1 : H Y D R O G E O L O G I C S T U D Y I N R I O A R R I B A C O U N T Y to public water systems to protect public health. These standards are not enforceable for private wells. Secondary MCLs are an unenforceable guideline regarding cosmetic or aesthetic effects. While these contaminants do not pose a threat to health, if present at levels above the secondary MCL, these constituents may cause water to appear cloudy or colored or to taste or smell bad. Because these standards are not enforceable for domestic water sources, the following information is provided to inform readers about general groundwater quality in the communities of Rio Arriba County. We tested all groundwater samples for the presence or absence of total coliform and E. coli bacteria. Total coliform is a group of bacteria present all around us, most of which are not dangerous to human health. However, these bacteria are not naturally present in groundwater and are an indication that more harmful organisms might be present. Fecal coliform and E. coli are subgroups within the total coliform group that primarily come from the feces of warm-blooded animals. The presence of E. coli indicates water has been exposed to feces and an immediate risk to human health exists. Major Cations and Anions Major ions include calcium (Ca2+), magnesium (Mg2+), sodium (Na+), potassium (K+), bicarbonate (HCO3 -), chloride (Cl-), and sulfate (SO4 2-), and these constitute a large amount of the elements dissolved in groundwater. Positively charged ions are called cations and negatively charged ions are called anions. Precipitation at a recharge area infiltrates through the soil, where carbon dioxide partial pressures are high due to plant root respiration in the soil. This carbon dioxide slightly acidifies the water, which begins dissolving minerals in the soil and unsaturated zone as it percolates to the water table. Because calcium carbonate (CaCO3) is a very common mineral and is quite soluble in water, young groundwaters usually have higher Ca2+ and HCO3 - relative to other major ions that make up other minerals. As groundwater moves along a flow path, it continues to interact with the rocks that make up the aquifer. These interactions include continued dissolution of minerals, adsorption of ions to minerals, cation exchange, and mixing with other groundwaters of different chemical compositions. Over time, less-soluble minerals are dissolved and other geochemical reactions occur, resulting in the water chemistry evolving over time, usually with higher TDS concentrations and different ion distributions. Older water, therefore, often looks very different chemically than it did when it started its journey in the recharge area hundreds or thousands of years prior. A Piper diagram (Fig. 1.5) is used to characterize different water types based on relative concentrations of cations (Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+, and K+; left triangular graph) and anions (HCO3 -, SO4 2-, and Cl-; right triangular graph). Piper diagrams allow us to define a water type based on the dominant cations and anions, as well as to identify trends that are indicative of different geochemical processes, such as dissolution of a specific rock type and mixing of different water sources. The example water chemistry data plotted on the Piper diagram in Figure 1.5 is characterized by the dominant cations of Na+ and K+ and the dominant anion of SO4 2-. For all water samples discussed below, K+ concentrations are much lower than Na+ concentrations. Therefore, we do not consider K+ and refer to the water type as sodium-sulfate (Na+-SO4 2-), with the dominant cation and anion being Na+ and SO4 2-, respectively. By projecting the position of the point from each triangular graph onto the diamond, water samples can be compared based on relative cation and anion concentrations. Stable Isotopes The stable isotopes of oxygen and hydrogen that make up the water molecule are useful tools for tracing the hydrologic cycle. The stable isotopes of hydrogen are H and 2H (also called deuterium, denoted as D), and the stable isotopes of oxygen are 18O and 16O. The isotopic composition of a water sample refers to the ratio of the heavier isotopes to the lighter isotopes (R) for hydrogen (D/H) and oxygen (18O/16O). Because these stable isotopes are part of the water molecule, small variations in these ratios act as labels that allow tracking of waters with different stable isotopic signatures. All isotopic compositions in this report are presented as relative concentrations, or the per mil deviation of R of a sample from R of a standard, as shown in this equation: \ud835\udeff\ud835\udeff= \ud835\udc45\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60\u2212\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60 \ud835\udc45\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60 \u22171,000\u2030 10 O P E N - F I L E R E P O R T 6 3 0 : E V A L U A T I O N O F G R O U N D W A T E R R E S O U R C E S F O R C O M M U N I T I E S I N R I O A R R I B A C O U N T Y ANIONS CATIONS 20 20 20 40 60 60 60 80 80 80 20 0 0 0 0 40 60 100 100 0 0 100 0 100 100 0 100 20 40 40 40 60 80 20 40 60 80 80 Bicarbonate type Sodium and Potassium type Magnesium type Chloride type Sulfate type Calcium type Calcium Chloride Magnesium Carbonate + Bicarbonate Sodium + Potassium Sulfate Chloride + Sulfate Calcium + Magnesium sample Figure 1.5.

Example of how major ion data are plotted on a Piper diagram. The example point represents a water sample with the dominant cation and anion of Na+ and SO4 2-, respectively. It is useful to plot stable isotope data on a \u03b4D versus \u03b418O graph, as shown in Figure 1.6. In general, most precipitation plots on or near the global meteoric water line (GMWL) with a slope of 8 and a deuterium excess (y-intercept) of 10, as demonstrated by Craig (1961). However, the linear trend that characterizes local precipitation in a specific area may deviate from the global meteoric water line. This deviated trend usually has a similar slope but a different deuterium excess (y-intercept) and is referred to as a local meteoric water line (LMWL). Figure 1.6 includes local meteoric water lines that have been constructed for the Rocky Mountains and the Rio Hondo watershed in the Sangre de Cristo Mountains to the north of Taos (Tolley et al., 2015). In the southwestern United States and New Mexico specifically, the stable isotopic composition of precipitation varies seasonally, with heavier isotopic values (fewer negative values that are closer to zero) during the summer monsoon season and lighter isotopic values during winter. This seasonal change in the average isotopic composition of precipitation is largely due to the large temperature 11 C H A P T E R 1 : H Y D R O G E O L O G I C S T U D Y I N R I O A R R I B A C O U N T Y difference and the different sources of moisture (summer monsoons versus winter frontal storms). Figure 1.6 shows the range of typical values for summer precipitation (the orange oval) and winter and spring precipitation (the blue oval) defined for the Sangre de Cristo Mountains to the east and northeast by Tolley et al. (2015). Other researchers have observed similar ranges of isotopic compositions for summer and winter precipitation in other parts of the state (Johnson et al., 2002; Newton et al., 2012). Stable isotopes of water can also be useful for identifying water that has undergone evaporation (Fig. 1.6). Isotopically lighter water molecules evaporate at a slightly higher rate than isotopically heavier water molecules, resulting in isotopic fractionation; this causes the residual water to become isotopically heavier and evolve along an evaporation line that deviates from the local meteoric water line with a slope between 4 and 6 (Dansgaard, 1964). Groundwater Age Estimates A subset of 25 water samples was tested for tritium (3H) and carbon-14 (14C), which are used to determine how old groundwater is or how long ago the sampled water recharged a local or regional aquifer in the recharge area. Measuring tritium concentrations in water allows us to identify young waters that are less than 50 years old. Carbon-14 is used to determine ages for much older water, on the order of hundreds of years to tens of thousands of -180 -160 -140 -120 -100 -80 -60 -40 -20 0 -20 -18 -16 -14 -12 -10 -8 -6 -4 -2 0 \u03b418O (\u2030) \u03b4D (\u2030) Global meteoric water line Sangre de Cristo Mountains meteoric water line (Tolley et al., 2015) Rocky Mountains meteoric water line (Nordstrom et al., 2007) Evaporation line Evaporation Winter and spring precipitation Summer and monsoon precipitation A B Figure 1.6.

(2012) observed tritium concentrations in precipitation in the Sacramento Mountains in southern New Mexico to range from 3 to 10 TU. For groundwater samples collected over the last 20 years or so, the general interpretation of tritium in groundwater is (1) tritium concentrations between 5 and 10 TU represent modern water less than 10 years old; (2) tritium concentrations between 1 and 5 TU indicate a mixture of modern recharge and older, \u201ctritium-dead\u201d water over the past 50 years or so; and (3) groundwater with tritium concentrations of 1 TU or less indicates that most recharge is more than 50 years old. Carbon-14 Atmospheric carbon dioxide gas, which has an approximate carbon-14 activity of 100 percent modern carbon (PMC; Clark and Fritz, 1997), is incorporated into the groundwater system (as bicarbonate, H14CO3 -) during infiltration of recharge through the vadose zone (the portion of the subsurface between the ground level and the water table). After infiltration crosses the water table, dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) is isolated from modern carbon-14 input from the atmosphere and soil zone reservoirs. The carbon-14 decays with time as the water travels along a flow path in the aquifer system. As a result, the amount of carbon-14 measured in the groundwater along a flow path gives an age, or the approximate amount of time that has passed since the water recharged the aquifer system. In general, lower PMC indicates older groundwater. However, to properly quantify groundwater age, it is usually necessary to correct the measured carbon-14 activity to account for hydrogeologic processes such as carbonate dissolution, isotopic exchange, and mixing of older and younger waters. These processes usually result in apparent (uncorrected) ages that are older than the actual age. Carbon-13 for Dissolved Inorganic Carbon (\u03b413CDIC) The stable carbon isotopic composition for DIC in groundwater (\u03b413CDIC) refers to the fraction R (13C/12C) for the dissolved carbon that is usually in the form of HCO3 -. The \u03b413CDIC is primarily a function of the carbon isotopic composition of the soil carbon dioxide in the recharge area and the carbon isotopic composition of the carbonate rock that has been dissolved (Clark and Fritz, 1997). The \u03b413C of soil carbon dioxide is very similar to that of the local vegetation, which is a function of the metabolic pathway by which carbon dioxide is converted to carbohydrates during photosynthesis. We used \u03b413CDIC to correct the carbon-14 dates for the dissolution of carbonate rocks, with an assumed \u03b413CDIC = 0 per mil for some samples but not others, as discussed below. OVERALL FINDINGS Despite the differences in the hydrogeologic systems in the study areas, the results and, to a degree, the conclusions for the different areas were similar. The majority of registered wells in all areas are completed in shallow alluvial aquifers. All of these aquifers are limited in size, with lateral widths coinciding with modern valley bottom widths, ranging from tens of meters to 5 km (a few hundred feet to about 3 mi). Estimated saturated thicknesses for shallow alluvial aquifers are relatively thin, ranging from 5 to 30 m (16\u2013100 ft). However, many registered wells produce water from the deep aquifer system. Some of these are located at slightly higher elevations and were drilled directly into older rocks; others are in valley bottoms, penetrating both the shallow alluvial aquifer and the deep aquifer system. Estimated yields for wells completed in shallow alluvial aquifers ranged from 5 to 30 gpm. Estimated yields for wells completed in the deep aquifer system ranged from 2 to 40 gpm. We sampled one well in the Chama area that was 13 C H A P T E R 1 : H Y D R O G E O L O G I C S T U D Y I N R I O A R R I B A C O U N T Y completed in the deep aquifer system and is a flowing artesian well (in which natural pressure causes groundwater to move to the surface through the well). Groundwater samples from the shallow alluvial aquifers in this study exhibited measurable tritium concentrations, indicating the presence of young, modern water less than 50 years old mixing with older, tritium-dead water. Groundwater samples from the deep aquifer systems all show essentially no tritium, with apparent carbon-14 ages of tens of thousands of years before present (YBP). Figure 1.7 shows the stable isotopic composition of all water samples plotted on a \u03b4D versus \u03b418O graph. All groundwater plots within the observed range of values for winter and spring precipitation. While the isotopic composition of groundwater is likely a mixture of winter and summer precipitation in the surrounding mountain ranges, the observed isotopic compositions for groundwater indicate the winter recharge component is significantly higher than the summer recharge component. Shallow alluvial aquifer waters are generally of good quality with very low TDS concentrations (<500 mg/L). However, several of these waters tested positive for total coliform, and a few tested positive for the presence of E. coli, demonstrating the susceptibility of the shallow alluvial aquifers to contamination from the surface. Many deep aquifer system waters and a few shallow aquifer system waters exhibited high arsenic concentrations that exceeded the primary MCL. Major ion chemistry for groundwater samples from the three study areas shows similar trends. The Piper diagram in Figure 1.8 shows that most shallow aquifer system waters for all study areas exhibit a -180 -160 -140 -120 -100 -80 -60 -40 -20 0 -20 -18 -16 -14 -12 -10 -8 -6 -4 -2 0 \u03b418O (\u2030) \u03b4D (\u2030) Chama well Abiquiu Valley well"

This water type is consistent with the young ages observed for shallow aquifer system waters because calcium carbonate is a very common mineral and is quite soluble. For most of the deep aquifer system waters, sodium (Na+) was the dominant cation (orange oval in the figure). The linear trend for the cations from calcium water type to sodium water type is commonly associated with a process called cation exchange. Cation exchange is a water/mineral interaction where Na+ ions that are adsorbed to clay minerals exchange with Ca2+ and Mg2+ ions that are dissolved in the groundwater. Because Ca2+ and Mg2+ have twice the charge of Na+, for every one molecule of Ca2+ or Mg2+ that adsorbs to a mineral surface, two molecules of Na+ are released into solution in the groundwater. This process is quite common, and evidence from this study indicates that all water samples have undergone cation exchange to some degree. However, there are several deep aquifer system waters in the Abiquiu Valley and the Dixon area that exhibit TDS concentrations less than 1,000 mg/L but have relative sodium concentrations greater than 95% Figure 1.8.

These waters show a variety of anion compositions; thus, these waters plot on the right bottom edge of the diamond portion of the Piper diagram (orange oval). These waters are produced from Santa Fe Group rocks, and they also exhibit high pH values (greater than 8.5). It is thought that abundant sodium and high pH are due to the dissolution of sodium feldspars from volcaniclastic sediments.

Continuous water level measurements in wells provide important information about aquifers. Fluctuations in groundwater levels and how these fluctuations correlate to changes in river flow rates, precipitation events, and droughts can help us understand recharge and discharge processes, as well as how climate change may be affecting the local and regional groundwater systems. Continuous water level data allow water planners to forecast possible crises resulting from a quickly decreasing water table during a short-term or long-term drought. We recommend installing data loggers in several wells that tap both the shallow and deep aquifer systems within these communities. Much geological research remains to be done in these areas, especially in the northern part of the Rio Chama watershed near Chama. The geologic map of the 15-minute Chama quadrangle (Muehlberger, 1967) needs to be updated to be more consistent with our current understanding of the geology of the southwestern United States. Geological work ranging from regional geophysical surveys to local-scale mapping would further our understanding of the local and regional hydrogeology. Shallow geophysical surveys may allow for quantification of water in the shallow alluvial aquifer system, and deeper geophysical surveys can help identify deep water sources of different salinities. By collecting water samples for water chemistry analyses from wells that tap the deep aquifer throughout the Rio Chama watershed, we may be able to locate alternative groundwater sources for some of these communities. The next three chapters present specific future work suggestions for each study area. 16 O P E N - F I L E R E P O R T 6 3 0 : E V A L U A T I O N O F G R O U N D W A T E R R E S O U R C E S F O R C O M M U N I T I E S I N R I O A R R I B A C O U N T Y Rio Chama at Chama, New Mexico, in June 2024 at approximately 250 cfs.

The village of Chama is situated in the southern Rocky Mountains near the New Mexico/Colorado border and was home to 917 people in 2020 (U.S. Census Bureau, 2024). The Rio Chama\u2019s surface water supplies irrigation water for local farmers and ranchers through an acequia system (community irrigation ditches) that has been in use for hundreds of years. Currently, Chama residents rely solely on the Chama Water System, which is operated by the Village of Chama, to divert surface water from the Rio Chama for up to approximately 1,600 residents. The Chama Water System includes four storage tanks and a treatment plant. The Chama Water System has had issues with turbidity in public water supplies, leading to boil water advisories in 2020 and 2023 (New Mexico Environment Department, 2024). Past efforts to supplement the community water supply with groundwater have not been successful, largely due to groundwater quality issues such as high arsenic concentrations. Finding a reliable groundwater source is important to build a sustainable water supply for this community, complement surface water supplies, and help eliminate the potential for water outages. Local Geology Chama, New Mexico, lies in the north-central portion of Rio Arriba County and represents the northernmost site in this regional assessment. Chama lies well outside the Espa\u00f1ola Basin, with geology distinct from that of the other study areas. Figure 2.2 shows the geologic map of the 15-minute Chama quadrangle (Muehlberger, 1967), which focuses on the area surrounding the community of Chama. The village of Chama mainly sits on Quaternary terrace deposits, labeled Qtg, Qtk, and Qtb; these are the units in which most domestic wells are currently completed. Exposed rocks above the terrace deposits include young landslide deposits (Ql) and Cretaceous rocks, including the Mesaverde Group (Kmv) to the west, as well as various members of the Mancos Shale, including (from youngest to oldest) the Niobrara (Kn), Carlile (Kcl), Greenhorn Limestone (Kgr), and Graneros Shale (Kg).

Three buried faults underlie Chama, which is located on a horst block that brings fractured sandstones of the Dakota Formation closer to the surface. Most wells in the vicinity of Chama that are not completed in the shallow alluvium (and not shown in the cross section) penetrate Mancos Shale, and a few penetrate the top of the Dakota. In general, these wells produce good-quality water, but high arsenic concentrations are sometimes observed. The following discussion will briefly cover pre-Cretaceous geologic units, followed by a more detailed description of Cretaceous rocks and overlying Cenozoic sediments. While a small amount of water from the pre-Cretaceous units may be moving upward into shallower formations along faults and fractures, we focus more on the shallow geology because almost all wells in the study area are completed in Cenozoic sediments and underlying Cretaceous rocks. The following descriptions of geologic units are largely based on those of Muehlberger (1967). 18 O P E N - F I L E R E P O R T 6 3 0 : E V A L U A T I O N O F G R O U N D W A T E R R E S O U R C E S F O R C O M M U N I T I E S I N R I O A R R I B A C O U N T Y 37\u00b0 -106\u00b030' 0000 408 0000 36 \u00a3 \u00a4 64,84 \u00a3 \u00a4 84 W ill ow Cre ek C a \u00f1o nes Creek R io B raz os Wolf C r ee k Rio Chamita Rio Ch a ma Willow Creek Brazos Cli\ufb00s A A\u2019 Heron Reservoir USGS stream gage Rio Chama Above Chama: NM - 08281400 Chama Chama Brazos Brazos Colorado New Mexico RIO CHAMA W AT ER SH ED intermittent stream perennial stream road Chama study area cross-section line A\u2014A' town county line 0 2.5 5 Miles 0 2.5 5 Kilometers Dixon Dixon Chama Chama Abiquiu Abiquiu TAOS CO RIO ARRIBA CO MORA CO SANDOVAL CO R io C h a m a R i o G ra n d e NM CO 84 64 Figure 2.1.

The basement rock is Precambrian Kiawa Mountain Formation, which is a massive quartzite that crops out in the Tusas Mountains southeast of Chama. Unconformably overlying the Kiawa Mountain Formation is the Triassic Chinle Formation, which is predominantly siltstones and thin sandstones of fluvial origin; this unit is generally an aquitard. Above the Chinle lies a stack of Jurassic sedimentary rocks consisting of (from oldest to youngest) the Entrada, Todilto, and Morrison Formations. The Entrada and Todilto Formations are grouped and are the oldest unit shown in the cross section (Fig. 2.3). The Entrada is a massive, cliff- forming sandstone that has significant outcrops in the area, while the overlying gypsum-bearing Todilto sediments are thin and discontinuous in the Chama area. The upper Jurassic in this area is represented by the Morrison Formation. The Morrison Formation is a very thick unit, predominantly consisting of interbedded sandstones and mudstones. Cretaceous Units The Dakota Formation makes up the base of the Cretaceous units in the Chama area. The Dakota Formation is a moderately thick (about 60\u2013120 m [200\u2013400 ft]) stack of massive sandstones with alternating mudstone members that have significant surface exposures to the east of Chama. The component sandstone units are fine grained, well sorted, and moderately rounded, but they exhibit silica cementation. The rounding and sorting of the Dakota Sandstone units could make them suitable aquifer units; however, the silica cementation could impact the permeability of these intervals. Research by Muehlberger (1967) suggested the Dakota unconformably overlies the Precambrian basement in the Tusas Mountains. The uppermost sandstone unit of the Dakota grades up into the Graneros Shale, which is the lowermost unit of the overlying Mancos Shale. The Mancos Shale is composed of several member units that are designated differently by different researchers. Here, we use the member designation of Graneros, Greenhorn Limestone, Carlile, and Niobrara. The Graneros and Carlile are predominantly thick-bedded, fine-grained sequences of muddy to silty sediments, and the Niobrara is shaly with a calcareous interval. Septarian calcareous concretions are common in the shale units of the Mancos and are often more than 0.3 m (1 ft) thick and around 1 to 1.5 m (3\u20135 ft) in diameter. The Greenhorn Limestone is distinct from adjacent shales and consists of about 9 to 20 m (30\u201370 ft) of interbedded shales and heavily fractured limestones that lie between the underlying Graneros and overlying Carlile units (Muehlberger, 1967; Ridgley and Hatch, 2013). The Carlile Shale hosts a member unit known as the Juana Lopez Member, which consists of interbedded shale, calcarenite, and sandstone (Muehlberger, 1967; Molenaar, 1977). Taken all together, the Mancos Shale is predominantly fine-grained deposits, with multiple sandstone or limestone intervals. Very little has been reported about the degree of cementation in the sandstone members, but the thin fractured limestone interval of the Greenhorn appears to have permeability. Above the Mancos lies the Mesaverde Group, which is typically divisible into the Point Lookout Sandstone, Menefee Formation, and Cliff House Sandstone. These units are exposed at the surface to the west of Chama (Fig. 2.2) and thus are not aquifers beneath the village of Chama. This unit is likely to be in the subsurface to the west and northwest of Chama. In the Chama area, these units are difficult to distinguish and were referred to by Muehlberger (1967) as the Mesaverde Group, undivided. Outcrops of the Mesaverde Group exhibit massive, cliff-forming beds composed of poorly sorted, very fine to fine sandstones. Small-scale apparent channel deposits occur in the upper part of the group and are less cemented than adjacent rocks. A thin shale unit (likely discontinuous in the area) can be used to distinguish the lower and upper sandstone units of the group. The upper sandstones are very fine to fine grained and are quite well cemented. The Mesaverde Group as a whole is predominantly sandy, without extensive silt or finer units, and is generally coarser grained than the adjacent stratigraphic units (Muehlberger, 1967). Other researchers variously report calcite, iron oxide, and clay cementation in the Mesaverde (Craigg, 2001), which could inhibit permeability. The Lewis Shale, which is exposed just west of the map area in Figure 2.2, defines the top of the Cretaceous sediments in the Chama area. Like the upper Mancos, the Lewis Shale is a thick sequence of dark-gray shale with septarian calcareous concretions (Muehlberger, 1967).

Cenozoic Units The Eocene Blanco Basin Formation is a conglomeratic sandstone interbedded with sandstone and siltstone composed of detritus shed from the Tusas Mountains during Laramide uplift and erosion (Brister, 1992). This rock unit is exposed in cliffs well above the elevation of the village of Chama and thus is not an important component of the hydrogeologic story. However, volcanic rocks of the San Juan volcanic field that were deposited on the Blanco Basin Formation\u2014the andesitic Conejos Formation and the ash-flow tuffs in the Treasure Mountain Group exposed in Colorado in the upper watershed of the Rio Chama\u2014have contributed detritus incorporated into the sediments that form the shallow aquifer. The volcanic component in the terrace and landslide deposits has influenced the water quality in Chama, as described in a later section. Tertiary terrace deposits in the Chama area are remnants of erosion by the paleo Chama River and consist mainly of coarse sands to boulders originating from stratigraphically nearby units down to the Mesaverde Group. The terrace gravels, which likely represent two erosional surfaces, tend to cap modern ridges. Younger (Quaternary) terrace gravels lie topographically much closer to modern drainage levels than do the Tertiary deposits, with the youngest of these gravels underlying the village of Chama to a thickness of less than 10.5 m (35 ft). Quaternary glacial deposits exist northeast of the village of Chama but are not extensive, whereas Quaternary landslide deposits are at the surface near Chama and are far more extensive at the surface than the glacial sediments. The young age and coarse clast sizes in the Tertiary and Quaternary gravels suggest high permeability in these deposits. Local Hydrogeology The climate in the Chama area can be characterized by large seasonal fluctuations in temperature from winter to summer (Western Regional Climate Center, 2024). Minimum daily temperatures can approach -14.2\u00b0C (6.4\u00b0F) in December and January. Summer temperatures are warm, reaching about 30\u00b0C (about 90\u00b0F) in July and August. Average annual temperatures decrease with elevation, and it is therefore much cooler in the adjacent mountains to the north and east. Annual precipitation in Chama averages 548 mm (21.3 in.), with approximately 40% of annual precipitation supplied by summer monsoons between July and October. Average annual precipitation increases with elevation, and it is much wetter in the adjacent mountains to the north and east. Chama is located in a relatively wide-open area within the Rio Chama valley. The Rio Chamita is to the west of the village of Chama and feeds into the Rio Chama south of town. The Rio Chama drains both groundwater and surface water from the San Juan Mountains to the north. Discharge rates in the Rio Chama vary seasonally, with the highest flow rates resulting from runoff in the late spring and early summer months (Fig. 2.4). In late summer, the monsoons increase discharge rates in the Rio Chama. Most wells in the Chama area are completed in the shallow alluvial aquifer, which is composed of a relatively thin layer of young gravel terrace deposits. The shallow alluvial aquifer is hydrologically connected to the river, providing base flow to the Rio Chama. Groundwater in the shallow aquifer likely originates as precipitation and snowmelt from the mountains to the north and east. Several wells in the area are drilled to depths between 76 and 107 m (250 and 350 ft) below the surface and appear to penetrate the upper part of the Cretaceous-aged Dakota Formation. DATA ASSESSMENT Figure 2.5 shows registered wells that included depth-to-water estimates in the well records. While existing water chemistry data for groundwater are scarce, some data are available for the Chama Water System (Rio Chama) and the well called RA-026 in this study (Table 2.1). The data source is Drinking Water Watch (New Mexico Environment Department, 2024). These data are included in the analyses below. We also extracted water chemistry data from the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) that included cation (Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+, K+) concentrations for the Rio Chama near La Puente between the years 2000 and 2010.

This entailed documenting well location and condition, assigning a unique well ID number for the project (RA-###), and collecting a measurement of the static depth to water in the well. Of the 16 wells inventoried, we sampled eight for water quality parameters (Fig. 2.6). Criteria for water quality site selection included maximized well coverage over the study area, accessibility, the ability of the well to be sampled, and the goal to sample wells completed in both shallow and deep aquifer systems. All samples were analyzed for general chemistry (major cations and anions), trace metals, the presence of bacteria, and the stable oxygen and hydrogen isotopes of water. A subset of four samples was tested for carbon-14 and tritium, which provides information about how long the water has been in the subsurface. RESULTS Water Levels Figure 2.7 shows depth-to-water measurements that range from 0.61 to 381 m (2\u20131,250 ft) below the surface. Most wells north of the Rio Brazos exhibit a much shallower depth to water than those just south of Chama, with many wells showing depth to water of less than 5 m (16.4 ft) below the surface. Figure 2.7 shows that the majority of wells exhibit depth-to-water values of 10 m (33 ft) or less below the surface. Most wells with depth to water of less than 6 m (19.5 ft) are completed in the shallow alluvial aquifer. Figure 2.8 shows the spatial distribution of total well depth for wells in the area. A rough bimodal distribution is observed for well depth, with the majority of wells being 38 m (125 ft) or less below the surface. The deeper distribution includes well depths ranging from 38 to 457 m (125\u20131,500 ft). Figures 2.9, 2.10, and 2.11 show well locations on the 15-minute Chama quadrangle geologic map (Muehlberger, 1967) from north to south, respectively. The colors of the points represent the depth to water for each well. Wells that are most likely completed in the shallow alluvial aquifer (blue points, depth to water \u22646 m) are almost all located in Quaternary terrace deposits (Qtk and Qtg). Wells with greater depth to water are likely part of a deeper aquifer system in the southern part of the study area (Fig. 2.11) on the east side of the Rio Chama, where Cretaceous rocks, including Mancos Shale and the Dakota Formation, are exposed at the surface. However, some of these deeper wells are also located in Quaternary sediments among the wells completed in the shallow alluvial system, suggesting that the drillers of these wells drilled past the shallow alluvial system to tap a deeper groundwater system. Depth to water for these deep wells is generally between 9 and 15 m (30 and 50 ft) below the surface, usually with a thin (0.6\u20133 m [2\u201310 ft]) water-bearing unit approximately 61 to 91 m (200\u2013300 ft) below the surface. However, for some wells depth to water can be much shallower. There is at least one flowing artesian well within the community of Chama, discussed in more detail below. Figure 2.12 shows a map of the water-table contours for the shallow alluvial aquifer in the study area. The contours represent the surface elevation of the water table. In general, groundwater flows perpendicularly to the contours from high elevation to low elevation. In the Chama area, our findings indicate that the shallow alluvial aquifer is being recharged from the San Juan Mountains to the north and the Tusas Mountains to the east. The Rio Chama and the Rio Chamita appear to be gaining in the study area reach, meaning that groundwater is discharging to the river. This can"

Figure 2.12 shows a map of the water-table contours for the shallow alluvial aquifer in the study area. The contours represent the surface elevation of the water table. In general, groundwater flows perpendicularly to the contours from high elevation to low elevation. In the Chama area, our findings indicate that the shallow alluvial aquifer is being recharged from the San Juan Mountains to the north and the Tusas Mountains to the east. The Rio Chama and the Rio Chamita appear to be gaining in the study area reach, meaning that groundwater is discharging to the river. This can be inferred from the water-table contour map because the contour lines extend upstream from where they intersect the stream. Water from the surrounding shallow aquifer is therefore supporting flow in the river. Groundwater flow in the area is generally north to south and angles toward the Rio Chama, where it ultimately discharges. Throughout much of the area, the slope of the water table does not exceed a gradient of 2% (1 m of head drop over 50 m of lateral distance). The saturated thickness map (Fig. 2.13) indicates a very thin shallow alluvial aquifer. In the village of Chama, the saturated thickness is between 3 and 10 m (10 and 33 ft). Depth-to-water measurements for wells inventoried are shown in Figure 2.14 and Table 2.2. For many wells, we were not able to find well logs that identified the total well depth, depth of the water-bearing unit, and unit description. For the deep aquifer system wells RA-024, RA-026, and RA-032, depth-to-water measurements were greater than 10 m (33 ft). However, the deep aquifer system well RA-033 exhibits the smallest depth-to-water measurement (0 m) because this well is a flowing artesian well, meaning the aquifer is under pressure, which pushes water to the surface. . .. . . . . . . ..... . .. ... ..... .. ..... .. . . ... . . . . .. . .... . .. . . ... . ... . .. . .. ... . ... . .. .. . ... .... .. .. .. . .. . . . . . . ..... ...... .. ... .. .. ... .. .. ... . . .... . .... . ... .... .... ... . ... .. . . . .. . .... .... .... .. .. .. . . . . . . . . . . .. . . . . . . . . . ..... . .. ... . ...... .. . ..... . .... . . .... . . . . . . . . . . .. . . . .... . . .. . . ... . ... . .. . . . .. .... . .... .. . .. .. . ... .... .. . ... .. 36\u00b055' 36\u00b052'30\" 36\u00b050' -106\u00b035' -106\u00b037'30\" -106\u00b040' 5000 408 0000 408 0000 36 5000 35 0000 35 . . . \u00b9 0 1 Miles 0 1 Kilometers RA-034 RA-030 RA-028 RA-027 RA-023 RA-022 RA-037 RA-036 RA-035 RA-024 RA-033 RA-032 RA-031 RA-029 RA-026 RA-025 RA-034 RA-030 RA-028 RA-027 RA-023 RA-022 RA-037 RA-036 RA-035 RA-024 RA-033 RA-032 RA-031 RA-029 RA-026 RA-025 R i o Ch am a W i l l o w Cre e k R i o C ha mi t a \u00a3 \u00a4 64,84 intermittent stream perennial stream road inventoried well water quality sampled Chama NM CO study area map extent 84 64 Figure 2.6.

All of the Chama shallow aquifer system waters tested positive for the presence of total coliform (Table 2.4). However, the presence of E. coli was detected in only two wells (RA-030 and RA-036). A likely source of these bacteria is septic tanks buried in the shallow alluvial aquifer. Significant groundwater contamination from septic tanks should also result in high concentrations of dissolved nitrate (NO3). While nitrate was detectable in all shallow aquifer system wells, concentrations were well below the primary MCL (Table 2.4). It is possible the nitrate concentrations have been lowered in this system by plant uptake of nitrate. RA-033 produces the only water that exceeded the primary MCL for arsenic (As), and water from RA-024 exceeded the secondary MCL for fluoride (F-; Fig. 2.16). For iron (Fe) and manganese (Mn; Fig. 2.17), the flowing artesian deep aquifer system well RA-033 exhibited concentrations exceeding the secondary MCLs. Interestingly, the shallow aquifer system well RA-036 also exhibited iron and manganese concentrations exceeding the secondary MCLs. General Chemistry Table 2.3 shows concentrations of major ions for the eight wells sampled in the Chama area. Other parameters shown include estimated well depth, depth to water, TDS, silica (SiO2), pH, and temperature. A quick review of the table reveals many differences in chemistry data from the different systems, including higher TDS concentrations and pH values exhibited by water produced from the deep aquifer system. 36 O P E N - F I L E R E P O R T 6 3 0 : E V A L U A T I O N O F G R O U N D W A T E R R E S O U R C E S F O R C O M M U N I T I E S I N R I O A R R I B A C O U N T Y Table 2.3.

For shallow aquifer system wells, which are characterized by low TDS concentrations (<250 mg/L) on the x-axis, silica accounts for about 20% of the TDS concentration by mass, just above Ca2+ concentrations. For the deep aquifer system groundwaters, silica accounts for only 0.6 to 2.8% of TDS concentrations. The element silicon (Si) combines with oxygen to form minerals called silicates, which make up more than 90% of the earth\u2019s crust. We can measure aqueous silicon concentrations, but usually we do not know the form or chemical species that it existed as in solution. Therefore, silica concentrations are reported as mg/L SiO2. Most silica concentrations in groundwater range from 5 to 85 mg/L (Langmuir, 1997), with a median value of 17 mg/L. Silica has been used by researchers to estimate residence time (Mar\u00e7ais et al., 2018) and as a geothermometer for geothermal and low-temperature waters (Fournier and Potter, 1982). Silica concentrations for water from the deep aquifer system ranged from 6.42 to 20.3 mg/L and for shallow aquifer system waters from 28.1 to 44.6 mg/L. These high silica concentrations were unexpected because the water from the shallow aquifer system appears, from many other lines of evidence, to be relatively young groundwater with limited water/mineral interactions. While only five water samples were collected over a fairly small area, these high silica concentrations may provide important information about what type of rock this water has interacted with between the primary recharge area and the well where it was sampled. Silicate weathering is the primary control on the water chemistry for the shallow aquifer system waters. Figure 2.18.

The water sample collected from RA-033 in the deep aquifer system shows the dominant cations and anions are Ca2+ and SO4 2-, respectively, which is indicative of the dissolution of gypsum (CaSO4). Interestingly, existing water chemistry data for well RA-026, located several miles west of Chama, plot close to water chemistry data for well RA-033. While the dominant cation and anion for samples RA-024 and RA-032 were Na+ and HCO3 -, respectively, RA-024 exhibits significantly more Cl- than RA-032.

Cation exchange is a water/mineral interaction where Na+ ions that are adsorbed to clay minerals exchange with Ca2+ and Mg2+ ions that are dissolved in the groundwater. Because Ca2+ and Mg2+ have twice the charge of Na+, for every one molecule of Ca2+ or Mg2+ that adsorbs to a mineral surface, two molecules of Na+ are released into solution in the groundwater. Stoichiometric analyses (not shown) confirm that almost all water samples showed some degree of cation exchange. It appears that cation exchange has significantly altered the chemical composition of water from RA-024 and RA-032, altering the cation chemistry of the water compared to that resulting from the dissolution of minerals. From the above discussion, we can conclude that the water chemistry for shallow aquifer system waters is controlled by silicate weathering (interactions with rocks high in silica) and the dissolution of CaCO3. For the deep aquifer system, geochemical controls include the dissolution of CaCO3 and CaSO4 (in the case of RA-033) as well as significant cation exchange. When looking at the anions in the Piper diagram (Fig. 2.19), the three deep aquifer system water samples each show quite different water chemistry, unlike the shallow aquifer system samples, suggesting that these deep aquifer system waters may have interacted with different types of rock and therefore represent water sources from distinct aquifers. While the shallow aquifer system waters are chemically similar, variations that are present suggest their chemical composition is affected by mixing with a small amount of water(s) from other sources. Figure 2.20 shows concentrations for selected dissolved constituents, including SiO2, Cl-, and Ca2+, as a function of TDS concentrations. We observe direct correlations to some degree for all of these constituents.

However, the increase of Cl- concentrations is not likely due to the same water/mineral interactions because Cl- is not commonly associated with volcanic rocks with high SiO2 content that are present near Chama, such as ash-flow tuff. The increase in SO4 2- as TDS increases is also not likely due to water/mineral interactions but rather due to mixing. The water sample RA-036 exhibits the lowest observed concentration for TDS and many other dissolved constituents, with Cl- concentrations being below the detection limit. Therefore, we will assume that RA-036 is representative of the shallow groundwater end member, with little to no mixing with other waters. Examination of the water chemistry in the three deep aquifer system samples (RA-024, RA-032, and RA-033) indicates that the addition of any single deep water source to the shallow water systems could not account for the increase in both Cl- and SO4 2- concentrations in the samples.

However, the increase of Cl- concentrations is not likely due to the same water/mineral interactions because Cl- is not commonly associated with volcanic rocks with high SiO2 content that are present near Chama, such as ash-flow tuff. The increase in SO4 2- as TDS increases is also not likely due to water/mineral interactions but rather due to mixing. The water sample RA-036 exhibits the lowest observed concentration for TDS and many other dissolved constituents, with Cl- concentrations being below the detection limit. Therefore, we will assume that RA-036 is representative of the shallow groundwater end member, with little to no mixing with other waters. Examination of the water chemistry in the three deep aquifer system samples (RA-024, RA-032, and RA-033) indicates that the addition of any single deep water source to the shallow water systems could not account for the increase in both Cl- and SO4 2- concentrations in the samples. Figure 2.21 shows Cl- and SO4 2- plotted versus TDS concentrations. Water from RA-033 is the only possible source of SO4 2- for the three deep water samples, but Cl- concentrations are too low to account for the increase in Cl- concentrations for shallow waters. Therefore, water from RA-024 looks like the most likely source of Cl-.

Therefore, both the deep and shallow aquifer systems appear to be largely recharged by snowmelt and winter precipitation in the mountains that has infiltrated into the subsurface without being exposed to the atmosphere (Fig. 1.6). Groundwater Age Estimates Table 2.5 shows age dating data, including tritium and carbon-14 ages. The shallow aquifer system waters from RA-029 and RA-036 exhibit 3H concentrations of 5.11 and 4.21 TU, respectively, indicating that a large proportion of this water is less than 50 years old. Corrected carbon-14 ages for RA-029 and RA-036 agree with 3H data, yielding relatively young ages of 120 and 51 YBP, respectively. Virtually no 3H was found in water from the two deep aquifer system wells RA-032 and RA-033, and corrected carbon-14 ages were greater than 39,000 and 14,818 YBP, respectively. For water from RA-036, the 13C-based correction for carbon-14 age changed the estimated age from 770 YBP to 51 YBP, making it younger than water from RA-029. Considering that RA-036 exhibits the lowest TDS and SiO2 concentrations for the shallow aquifer system waters, it makes sense that RA-036 also produces the youngest water. Using the corrected ages and SiO2 concentrations for RA-029 and RA-036, we were able to estimate ages for the other shallow aquifer system wells based on SiO2 concentrations. Shallow aquifer system water appears to range in age from 51 to 135 years old. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS Characterization of the Shallow Alluvial Aquifer For the following sections, refer to Figure 2.22\u2014a hydrogeologic conceptual model of the region based on the information and analyses above. In general, the shallow alluvial aquifer in the Chama area is very limited in size and permeability. While some Chama residents use groundwater from this aquifer, and the quality of this water is quite high, it does not appear to be sufficient for a community water supply. Existing wells in the area that tap deeper aquifers show that water levels in the wells are much higher than the apparent water-bearing unit, indicating that these aquifers are confined and under pressure. In the presence of open fractures and faults, this deep aquifer system water can move upward into the shallow aquifer system. Hydrogeologic Description The shallow aquifer system comprises Quaternary sediments, including 11 different terrace deposits that follow the Rio Chama valley floor (Figs. 2.9, 2.10, and 2.11). The width of the aquifer is limited by the lateral extent of these deposits and is widest where tributaries feed into the Rio Chama, such as the area near Chama (Fig. 2.9). In other areas, such as just north of mouth of the Rio Brazos (bottom of Fig. 2.10), the width of the aquifer is much smaller. These terraces were not described in detail by Muehlberger (1967), but he did identify a young terrace deposit (Qtg) as a gravel deposit measuring less than 10 m thick. The term \u201cgravel\u201d that is in buried sediments suggests large grain sizes and high permeability, making this thin terrace a favorable aquifer unit within this layered system.

Hydrogeologic conceptual model for the Chama area. The width of the valley limits the extent of the shallow alluvial aquifer, which is primarily recharged by rain and snow in the mountains to the north and east. In this area, the Rio Chama is primarily a gaining stream, where groundwater from the shallow alluvial aquifer discharges into the river. The deep aquifer system includes the Mancos Shale (Graneros [Kg], Greenhorn Limestone [Kgr], Carlile [Kcl], and Niobrara [Kn]) and the Dakota Sandstone. The distribution of water-bearing zones in the Mancos Shale that are composed of more permeable rock, such as sandstone, is highly variable both vertically and laterally. The Greenhorn Limestone generally produces water of good quality. For most wells penetrating water-bearing zones in the deep aquifer system, water levels in the wells rise significantly above the water-bearing zone, indicating that this aquifer system is under confined conditions (under pressure).

From the estimated yields of these wells, which can be as low as 2 to 5 gpm, it appears enough clay material is present to significantly decrease the average permeability of the aquifer. Drillers tended to stop drilling when they reached gray or black shale, presumed to be the top of the Mancos Shale\u2014a very low-permeability formation. Future work is required to characterize the thickness, extent, and hydrologic properties of these deposits. Based on carbon-14 and tritium dating results, the groundwater residing in the shallow alluvial aquifer is primarily sourced from precipitation or snowmelt that infiltrated to the water table in the high mountains approximately 105 to 50 years ago. Water-table contours in Figure 2.12 indicate that recharge is coming from the San Juan Mountains to the north and the Tusas Mountains to the east. High SiO2 concentrations confirm that the water has interacted with volcanic rocks incorporated in the Quaternary sediments. Once recharged groundwater meets the valley floor, it flows generally parallel to and toward the Rio Chama in shallow deposits. Figure 2.13 shows the estimated saturated thickness of the shallow alluvial aquifer. While some uncertainty is associated with this estimate due to lack of data in some areas, it is apparent that the saturated thickness is very thin, with a median value of 6 m (20 ft). Groundwater in this aquifer ultimately discharges into the Rio Chama. The strong hydrologic connection between the river and the shallow aquifer is demonstrated in Figure 2.23, which shows a USGS time series Figure 2.23.

Also, the relative cation distribution for all the different Rio Chama samples (Fig. 2.24) is very similar to those observed for the shallow groundwater samples, with Ca2+ as the dominant cation.

Well RA-036 exhibited iron and manganese concentrations that exceed the EPA secondary MCLs of 0.3 and 0.05 mg/L, respectively. The source of these metals is not known, but iron and manganese are common constituents in many alluvial aquifers. Interestingly, all five shallow aquifer system wells tested positive for the presence of total coliform, and two of the wells produced water that also tested positive for the presence of E. coli. The most likely source of this contamination is effluent from septic tanks in the shallow subsurface. Groundwater from the shallow aquifer system exhibits high SiO2 concentrations, ranging from 28.1 to 44.6 mg/L, which is a distinguishing feature for water in the shallow alluvial aquifer but does not present a health risk. These SiO2 concentrations are due to being in contact with and interacting with clasts of high-silica volcanic rocks such as volcanic tuff. In addition to dissolved silica, shallow aquifer system water chemistry shows evidence of the dissolution of CaCO3 and minor cation exchange. While Cl- and SO4 2- concentrations in the shallow aquifer system are quite low (<20 mg/L; Table 2.3), the source of these ions is groundwaters from the deep system, which are likely moving upward along faults and fractures beneath Chama. Figure 2.24. Each colored line represents the cation composition of one of the groundwater water samples (labeled). Maximum and minimum concentrations are defined by the USGS cation dataset shown in Figure 2.23. Those samples were collected between 1999 and 2009 from the Rio Chama. 48 O P E N - F I L E R E P O R T 6 3 0 : E V A L U A T I O N O F G R O U N D W A T E R R E S O U R C E S F O R C O M M U N I T I E S I N R I O A R R I B A C O U N T Y Characterization of the Deep Aquifer Systems Of the eight groundwater samples collected in the Chama area, three produce water from a deeper system. According to well logs, many deep aquifer system wells are drilled to between 60 and 120 m (200 and 400 ft) below the surface, with the water- bearing unit defined as a relatively thin unit of rock located close to the bottom of the well. Many such wells in the Chama area appear to be completed in the Cretaceous Mancos Shale or the top of the Dakota Sandstone (Fig. 2.3). However, most of these wells show depth to water of less than 30 m (100 ft) below the surface, indicating that groundwater from the water-bearing unit moved upward under pressure along the well bore after being tapped by the well. These data indicate the deeper aquifers are confined. Interestingly, the three deep water samples all exhibit different chemical signatures. Water from the flowing artesian well RA-033 exhibits the lowest TDS concentration (584 mg/L) of the deep wells. This water sample is the only one with significant SO4 2- content, with a Ca-SO4 water type. Preliminary findings suggest very small amounts of water with a geochemical signature similar to that of RA-033 are leaking into the shallow aquifer system. RA-026 is located about 8.6 km west of Chama and is reported to be about 180 m (600 ft) deep, penetrating a water-bearing zone composed of limestone and white shale from 165 to 180 m (540\u2013600 ft) below the surface. The presence of limestone indicates the geologic formation is very likely the Greenhorn Limestone, which is part of the Mancos Shale. Water from RA-026 is defined as a Ca-SO4 water type and plots very close to RA-033 (Fig. 2.19). Therefore, RA-033 is likely producing water from the Greenhorn Limestone. The fact that RA-033 is a flowing artesian well demonstrates that the water in this deeper aquifer is confined and under pressure. Therefore, it is possible for this water to move toward the land surface along faults and fractures and thus mix with shallow groundwater. As mentioned above, it appears that a small amount of this deeper groundwater is mixing with the shallow aquifer system, resulting in an increase in SO4 and TDS (Fig. 2.21). We do not know what formations the other two deep aquifer system wells (RA-024 and RA-032) are producing water from, but their different water chemistry suggests they have interacted with different rocks. Figure 2.25 provides more evidence for the upwelling of deep groundwater into the shallow aquifer system. Interestingly, the fluctuation of cation concentrations in the river (Fig. 2.23) appears to be inversely related to river discharge rates, with higher concentrations during low discharge rates and lower concentrations during times of high discharge rates. Seasonal increases in river discharge are due to spring runoff, when snow in the mountains melts and feeds local and regional streams. During these times of high discharge, much of the water in the river is very young, coming directly from the snowmelt and effectively mixing with groundwater discharge in the channel and diluting dissolved ion concentrations. Figure 2.25 shows Ca2+/Mg2+ ratios for river water and our shallow groundwater samples (horizontal lines). For much of that time period, Ca2+/Mg2+ ratios in river water fluctuated closely around the value of 5, which correlates well with Ca2+/Mg2+ ratios for the shallow aquifer system aquifer wells RA-029 and RA-036. However, the Ca2+/Mg2+ ratio of river water began decreasing in early 2001, reaching a low value of 3.2, which is between the observed Ca2+/Mg2+ ratios for water from the deep aquifer system wells RA-033 and RA-032 (3.37 and 2.93, respectively).

This time period correlates with a very dry period in 2001 and 2002, when spring runoff events were very small. This suggests that during dry periods with very low runoff events, water from the deeper aquifers can discharge into the river, significantly affecting the quality of river water. This observation has implications for the effects of climate change on water quality in the Rio Chama. FUTURE WORK It was very difficult to find geologic and hydrogeologic data and literature for this region compared with many other regions in New Mexico studied by the NMBGMR. The few consultant reports cited in the Regional Water Plan (La Calandria Associates, Inc., 2006) are quite old and difficult to find. The 2016 Regional Water Plan (New Mexico Interstate Stream Commission, 2016) confirms the scarcity of hydrogeologic data because there are no current USGS groundwater monitoring sites. That plan also stated, \u201cThough quantitative data were limited, the 2006 plan indicated that based on qualitative assessment of the available data, there are no aquifer systems within the Rio Chama watershed 49 C H A P T E R 2 : A S S E S S M E N T O F G R O U N D W A T E R R E S O U R C E S F O R C H A M A , N E W M E X I C O 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 12/6/1999 4/19/2001 9/1/2002 1/14/2004 5/28/2005 10/10/2006 2/22/2008 7/6/2009 Ca 2+/Mg 2+ Rio Chama Near La Puente deep aquifer system shallow aquifer system RA-032 RA-032 RA-030 RA-030 RA-029 RA-029 RA-033 RA-033 RA-024 RA-024 RA-023 RA-023 RA-034 RA-034 RA-036 RA-036 flowing artesian well flowing artesian well Figure 2.25.

A review of available geologic and hydrogeologic data for this study revealed that we do not have enough information to make educated decisions regarding groundwater availability in the Chama area. While it would be beneficial to thoroughly update the geologic map by Muehlberger, for next steps, we instead recommend focusing on specific areas where information is missing, such as developing better lithologic descriptions for the shallow alluvial aquifer. We also recommend focusing on areas of potential deep aquifer system water extraction. Tasks should include on-the-ground geologic assessment, small-scale mapping investigations, and constructing multiple detailed cross sections in areas of interest. For the initial phase of the study described in this report, we focused our water sampling on the immediate area around the community of Chama. We sampled only three deep aquifer system wells, and they all exhibited different water chemistry from one another. We clearly do not have enough data to effectively characterize the deep aquifer system. Future work should include the sampling of the deep aquifer system over a larger area, focusing on areas circled in Figure 2.26. It appears many of these wells are completed in the Dakota Sandstone, which may be a suitable aquifer. By analyzing water from several deep aquifer system wells, we may be able to identify multiple wells that produce water from the same aquifer. Understanding the spatial relationship between wells that are apparently completed in the same aquifer may help to identify areas potentially suitable for well installation. 50 O P E N - F I L E R E P O R T 6 3 0 : E V A L U A T I O N O F G R O U N D W A T E R R E S O U R C E S F O R C O M M U N I T I E S I N R I O A R R I B A C O U N T Y 4090000 4080000 4070000 370000 360000 350000 37\u00b0 36\u00b050' -106\u00b030' -106\u00b040' \u00a3 \u00a4 64,84 \u00a3 \u00a4 84 W ill ow Cr eek C a\u00f1 on es Cr eek Ri o Br azos Wolf C r e ek Rio Chamita Rio Cha ma Litt le W illow C r e e k Chama Chama Lobato Lobato Brazos Brazos Well Depth (m bgs) <30 30\u201360 60\u2013120 120\u2013240 >240 0 1 Miles 0 1 Kilometers intermittent stream perennial stream road Chama study area town county line Willow Creek Willow Creek TAOS CO RIO ARRIBA CO MORA CO SANDOVAL CO R io C h a ma R i o G ra n d e 84 64 Figure 2.26.

Groundwater is limited in these communities, and surface water supplies irrigation water for local farmers and ranchers through acequias, which have been used for hundreds of years. El Rito is surrounded by the Carson National Forest, about 12 mi north of Abiquiu, and had a population of 749 in 2020 (U.S. Census Bureau, 2024). Groundwater in the El Rito area is used for domestic and public supply through individual, private domestic, and irrigation wells and two community water systems. El Rito Canyon Mutual Domestic Water Consumers Association (MDWCA) serves approximately 300 users, supplied by one well. El Rito Regional Water and Waste Water Association serves approximately 1,200 users with groundwater from one active well. Historically, finding a secure groundwater source has been challenging in El Rito (La Calandria Associates, Inc., 2006), which has limited sustained growth and development. In general, Santa Fe Group rocks, which are important aquifers in most other areas of the northern Espa\u00f1ola Basin, are thinner and finer grained in the area surrounding El Rito and therefore have limited potential as an effective community water supply. Studies in the area (Geohydrology Associates, Inc., 1979) have shown that groundwater resources vary greatly from one location to another, with wells (including test holes) ranging in depth from 102 to 731 ft below the surface and yields ranging from 0 to 80 gpm. Abiquiu, most famous as the home of artist Georgia O\u2019Keeffe, is located 40 mi north of Santa Fe on the Rio Chama and had a population of 181 in 2020 (U.S. Census Bureau, 2024). The primary use of surface water in Abiquiu is irrigation, with water distributed through a network of acequias. Abiquiu\u2019s primary groundwater uses are domestic and commercial wells that mainly tap shallow alluvial deposits and deeper Santa Fe Group rocks. The Abiquiu MDWCA serves about 400 people with water discharging from a spring approximately 10 mi southwest of Abiquiu along Abiquiu Creek. With the current flow rate, this spring is barely adequate to meet the demands of Abiquiu. The nearby community of Barranca, which is located just west of Abiquiu, relies on groundwater pumped from one well to the Barranco MDWCA. Medanales is located about 8 mi downstream of Abiquiu on the Rio Chama and had a population of 224 in 2020 (U.S. Census Bureau, 2024). The primary uses of groundwater and surface water are similar to those in Abiquiu: domestic wells supply households and surface water is used for irrigation through a network of acequias. There are no public water systems in Medanales. In general, due to limited thickness and areal extent, alluvial aquifers are not a reliable groundwater source. Deeper aquifers in the Santa Fe Group show some promise for domestic water supplies in this area (La Calandria Associates, Inc., 2006). Securing a stable long-term groundwater source in this area is crucial to Medanales\u2019s ability to respond resiliently to changes in future water supply and demand. 52 O P E N - F I L E R E P O R T 6 3 0 : E V A L U A T I O N O F G R O U N D W A T E R R E S O U R C E S F O R C O M M U N I T I E S I N R I O A R R I B A C O U N T Y 36\u00b020' 36\u00b010' -106\u00b010' -106\u00b020' 0000 403 0000 402 0000 401 0000 400 0000 40 0000 39 0000 38 0 1 2 Miles 0 1 2 Kilometers S O U T H E R N R O C K Y M O U N T A I N S S O U T H E R N R O C K Y M O U N T A I N S RA-091 RA-091 RA-084 RA-084 RA-009 RA-009 RA-1 004 RA-1 004 El Rito El Rito Las Placitas Las Placitas Abiquiu Abiquiu Medanales Medanales R io C h a m a \u00a3 \u00a4 84 Espa\u00f1ola Basin study area intermittent stream perennial stream road physiographic division towns county line Dixon Dixon Abiquiu Abiquiu RIO ARRIBA CO Rio G r a n d e R i o C h a m a 84 Figure 3.1.

This study focuses on the northwest portion of the Espa\u00f1ola Basin, largely coinciding with the Abiquiu embayment and the lower Rio Chama watershed, where El Rito, Abiquiu, and Medanales are located. The stratigraphy of the Abiquiu embayment portion of the northern Espa\u00f1ola Basin is dominated by Santa Fe Group basin-fill deposits and minor interfingering tongues of volcanic units (May, 1979, 1984a, 1984b; Koning et al., 2004a, 2008, 2011a). The Santa Fe Group basin-fill deposits include the Abiquiu and Tesuque Formations (Fig. 3.2) and cover a time period ranging from the late Oligocene to the middle Miocene (about 27 to 8 million years ago; Koning et al., 2011a, 2011b). The Ritito Conglomerate (pebble to cobble gravel conglomerate) and the El Rito Formation (red lithified conglomeratic sandstone, sandstone, and mudstone) unconformably overlie Proterozoic\u2013Mesozoic rocks. Much focus in this section is given to the sedimentary member units of the Tesuque Formation because these units of the Santa Fe Group are important aquifers. However, we also discuss overlying Quaternary sediments due to their implications for groundwater storage and flow. Quaternary surficial units in the Abiquiu embayment of the Espa\u00f1ola Basin are predominantly divided between colluvial and alluvial features (Koning et al., 2004a, 2008; Maldonado, 2008). The colluvial units consist of undivided colluvium with landslide, eolian, and sheetwash deposits. The alluvial features consist of valley-floor alluvium, alluvial fan deposits, and gravel terraces associated with local modern tributaries and minor drainages. Valley-floor alluvial sequences range in age from latest Pleistocene to the present and are generally composed of silty sands, sands, and gravels underlying modern valley floors of the Rio Chama and its tributaries. These alluvial deposits generally occur in planar to lenticular beds. Compositionally, they primarily reflect erosion of upstream basin-fill sediment of the Santa Fe Group and older bedrock units. Alluvial fan deposits are generally found at the mouths of modern canyons, but some older fans are found at higher topographic positions in the valleys. Gravel terraces range in age from late Miocene to Quaternary. The upper and middle part of the Santa Fe Group generally correlates to the Tesuque Formation (Fig. 3.2). The Miocene Ojo Caliente Sandstone (thickness up to 200\u2013400 m [650\u20131,300 ft]) is the uppermost member unit of the Tesuque Formation near the communities we studied. The Ojo Caliente here is composed of light-tan to tan, typically upper-fine to upper-medium sands that are interpreted to reflect deposition in a wind-blown (eolian) dune field depositional environment (May, 1979; Koning et al., 2004a, 2011b). The lower Ojo Caliente interfingers with the underlying Miocene Chama-El Rito Member, which is distinguished from the overlying Ojo Caliente sandstone by its slight orange color and presence of interbedded mudstones and variably cemented gravels (conglomerates; May, 1979; Ekas et al., 1984; Koning et al., 2004a). Outside of the cemented gravel beds, the sands are mainly lower fine to upper fine (Koning et al., 2004a).

The lower part of the Chama-El Rito Member, exposed southeast of El Rito, is lighter colored, better consolidated and cemented, and commonly exhibits more distinctive bedding than sandy intervals upsection (Koning et al., 2008). The Chama-El Rito Member becomes increasingly gravelly to the north-northeast. Underlying the Chama-El Rito Member are 300 m (985 ft) of strata composed of either the Cordito Member of the lower Los Pinos Formation or the Abiquiu Formation (Koning et al., 2011a). The Cordito Member grades laterally southwest into the Abiquiu Formation, but near El Rito, a tongue of the upper Cordito 30 to 60 m (100\u2013200 ft) thick extends over the Abiquiu Formation (Koning et al., 2008). The Cordito Member is composed of volcaniclastic sandstones (fine to very coarse grained) and gravels (Manley, 1981; Koning et al., 2008). The Abiquiu Formation is a whitish sandstone, pebbly sandstone, and clayey-silty sandstone with minor sandy gravel beds (Smith, 1935, 1938; Vazzana and Ingersoll, 1981; Smith, 1995; Moore, 2000; Koning et al., 2008, 2011a; Maldonado,"

This unit is around 150 m (500 ft) thick near Abiquiu (Maldonado, 2008). Erosion of the Abiquiu Formation has created the picturesque, whitish badlands seen near the town of Abiquiu (Koning et al., 2008). The underlying Ritito Conglomerate and El Rito Formation are significantly thinner collectively (200\u2013300 m [650\u20131,000 ft]) in the Abiquiu area (Maldonado, 2008) than the two overlying Santa Fe Group formations. They are generally coarse-grained sedimentary rocks containing notable proportions of gravel and medium- to very coarse-grained sandstones (Smith, 1938; Barker, 1958; Kelley, 1978; Moore, 2000; Maldonado and Kelley, 2009; Kelley et al., 2013). The El Rito Formation unconformably overlies a sequence of Proterozoic\u2013Mesozoic rocks that generally do not crop out in the northern Espa\u00f1ola Basin (Kelley, 1978). From a hydrogeologic perspective, Quaternary alluvial deposits make the best aquifers because these deposits have higher permeability than the units of the Santa Fe Group (Koning et al., 2007). Aquifer tests in the Quaternary alluvium near El Rito showed high hydraulic conductivity and relatively thick alluvium depths (Geohydrology Associates, Inc., 1979). However, the areal extents and thicknesses of these deposits vary significantly throughout the Rio Chama watershed. The Ojo Caliente Member of the Tesuque Formation exhibits lower permeability than alluvial sediments (Koning et al., 2007) but is inferred to be more permeable than the middle to lower Chama-El Rito Member (Tesuque Formation). In general, the permeability of the Tesuque Formation decreases with depth. However, there appear to be multiple permeable zones within the Chama-El Rito Member that produce good-quality water under confined conditions in the Medanales and Abiquiu regions. Figure 3.3 shows the study region on a simplified geologic map, along with cross-section lines, including a west\u2013east cross section (Fig. 3.4) perpendicular to El Rito Creek, from the El Rito 7.5-minute quadrangle (Koning et al., 2008); a west\u2013east cross section (Fig. 3.5) approximately parallel to the Rio Chama, based on geologic map data from the Abiquiu 7.5-minute quadrangle (Maldonado, 2008) and NMOSE well data; and a northwest\u2013southeast cross section (Fig. 3.6) approximately parallel to the Rio Chama based on surface geology from Koning et al. (2004a) and NMOSE well data. El Rito is located along El Rito Creek, about 15 mi upstream from the confluence with the Rio Chama. The small community of Las Placitas is located just downstream of El Rito. These communities are located where the valley widens, with Quaternary terrace deposits (Qt) to the west of El Rito Creek and associated Quaternary alluvium deposits (Qa) under the modern river. The terrace deposits are associated with El Rito Creek and are generally 6 to 25 m (20\u201380 ft) above the present-day channel elevations (Koning et al., 2008). Quaternary alluvium is located at the valley bottoms adjacent to El Rito Creek and the Rio Chama. Over much of the study area, Santa Fe Group rocks are exposed at the surface, with the Ojo Caliente Member of the Tesuque Formation (Tto) cropping out in the southern and southeastern portion of the study area, south of Abiquiu and surrounding Medanales. Moving downsection, the Chama-El Rito Member of the Tesuque Formation is exposed in the lower slopes of mesas to the east and northeast of Abiquiu. The Chama-El Rito Member is relatively extensive south of El Rito. 55 C H A P T E R 3 : A S S E S S M E N T O F G R O U N D W A T E R R E S O U R C E S F O R T H E C O M M U N I T I E S O F E L R I T

Important faults include the Ca\u00f1ones fault about 6 km (3.7 mi) to the west of Abiquiu, the Garcia fault 3 km (1.8 mi) west of Abiquiu, the Cerrito Blanca fault near Abiquiu, and the fault system that somewhat parallels southern El Rito Creek (i.e., the El Rito fault). Local Hydrogeology Average precipitation in Rio Arriba County displays general seasonal and spatial trends; it is usually greater at higher elevations, during summer, and to the north. Average annual precipitation at El Rito and Abiquiu Reservoir is 308 and 247 mm (12 and 9.7 in.), respectively, with about 50% of precipitation falling during the summer monsoons between July and September. Flow in the Rio Chama in the Abiquiu and Medanales areas is primarily controlled by water releases from Abiquiu Reservoir (Fig. 3.7).

The primary use of groundwater in this area is domestic, with some wells used for irrigation and a few for livestock watering and community use. Wells in the El Rito area are mostly completed in a shallow alluvial aquifer composed of boulders, gravel, sand, and clay, locally overlying gray clay or sandstone. The majority of wells are completed at depths less than 46 m (150 ft), but a few domestic wells have been completed near 91 m (300 ft) deep. This shallow aquifer is likely replenished by precipitation and melting snow from the surrounding hills and is connected to El Rito Creek. During the 1950s and 1960s, several shallow (around 7 m [23 ft]) collection galleries supplied the communities of El Rito and Las Placitas (Geohydrology Associates, Inc., 1979), and hundreds of private wells tapping shallow gravel deposits supplied water to local residents. Wells drilled into the shallow aquifer ranged from 12 to 24 m (40\u201380 ft) deep. Groundwater levels fluctuate seasonally, with the highest water levels occurring in spring when excess water in the acequias is diverted from El Rito Creek. Groundwater levels in the shallow alluvial aquifer are lowest during late fall and winter when flow in the acequias is low; hand-dug wells up to 8 m (26 ft) deep would sometimes go dry during winter months. Geohydrology Associates, Inc. (1979) conducted an aquifer test on a well located northwest of El Rito on a former sawmill site. The sawmill well, with a total depth of about 31 m (102 ft), apparently penetrated a buried channel deposit composed of an unusually thick sequence of gravel and had an approximate sustained production of about 80 gpm. Water from this well was of good quality, with TDS below 500 mg/L. The existence of this well in the shallow alluvial aquifer indicates that, in some areas of the thin alluvial aquifer, there may be zones that can produce enough good-quality water to supply local communities. An exploratory well in Las Placitas (shown in Fig. 3.4 as Las Placitas Well) was drilled to the depth of 223 m (731 ft), penetrating the Los Pinos and Abiquiu Formations (Geohydrology Associates, Inc., 1979). The well log for this well shows permeable materials, such as medium- and coarse-grained sand and some gravel. However, an abundance of clay impacts the permeability of this aquifer; it has an estimated sustained pumping rate of 14 gpm. This water exhibited a low TDS concentration of 220 mg/L, a sodium-bicarbonate water type, and a pH of 8.87. 60 O P E N - F I L E R E P O R T 6 3 0 : E V A L U A T I O N O F G R O U N D W A T E R R E S O U R C E S F O R C O M M U N I T I E S I N R I O A R R I B A C O U N T Y Figure 3.7.

These data were used to differentiate wells producing water from the shallow alluvial aquifer from those producing water from the deep aquifer system. New Data Collection For this regional study area, we inventoried 42 wells, 34 of which were sampled (Fig. 3.10) for general chemistry (major cations and anions), trace metals, the presence of bacteria, and the stable oxygen and hydrogen isotopes of water. A subset of 24 samples was tested for carbon-14 and tritium, which provides information about how long the water has been in the subsurface. Timmons et al. (2013) described the sampling procedures we used in more detail. RESULTS Water Levels Figure 3.11 shows depths to water reported in well-drilling logs (NMOSE, 2024), ranging from 0.9 to 207 m (3\u2013680 ft) below the surface. Total well depths range from 2.4 to 317 m (8\u20131,000 ft) below the surface. Similar spatial variability is observed for both depth to water and total well depth, with wells with the smallest depth-to-water values and shallowest total depths occurring in close proximity to the Rio Chama and El Rito Creek. Obviously, these wells likely tap the shallow alluvial aquifer. A notable feature of the spatial distribution of wells is the large group of wells north of Medanales with depth-to- water measurements greater than 10 m (33 ft) below the surface (Fig. 3.11). These wells tap groundwater at greater depths within the Santa Fe Group rocks. Figure 3.12 shows the same depth-to-water measurements as a function of total well depth. The rectangle at the bottom left defines the 80th percentile for both depth to water and total well depth. About 75% of all the wells are within this group and are likely completed in the shallow alluvial aquifer.

These wells tap groundwater at greater depths within the Santa Fe Group rocks. Figure 3.12 shows the same depth-to-water measurements as a function of total well depth. The rectangle at the bottom left defines the 80th percentile for both depth to water and total well depth. About 75% of all the wells are within this group and are likely completed in the shallow alluvial aquifer. Assuming these wells fully penetrate the shallow alluvial aquifer (meaning the bottom of the well coincides with the bottom of the aquifer), we can estimate the saturated thickness of the aquifer in the vicinity of the well by subtracting depth to water from the total well depth. Assuming that depth to water and total well depth for those wells are representative of most of the shallow alluvial aquifers, the maximum saturated thickness is about 30 m (100 ft). As well depth increases, so does the maximum observed depth to water, indicating the groundwater being tapped by deeper wells is located significantly below the shallow alluvial aquifer. However, for most wells with total depth between 50 and 250 m (160 and 820 ft) below the surface, depth-to-water measurements range from just a few meters above the bottom of the well to tens of meters above the total well depth (close to the surface). Well records for many of these wells identify the depth of the water-bearing unit to be near the total well depth. Water from this unit is usually under pressure that causes the water level to rise in the well above the water-bearing unit, sometimes bringing it very close to the surface. Figure 3.13 focuses on the El Rito area, which is located at a higher elevation than Abiquiu or Medanales. The depth to water for most wells in this area is less than 10 m (33 ft) below the surface, and most wells are located near the valley bottom, which correlates to young Quaternary alluvium and terrace deposits (Fig. 3.13). A few wells with deeper depth-to-water measurements are scattered throughout the area. Along the Rio Chama between Abiquiu and Medanales, spatial trends for depth to water in existing wells are much more apparent, with most wells with depth to water of less than 5 m (16 ft) located closest to the river, on or just above the valley bottom (Fig. 3.14). In general, as the distance of the wells from the river increases (and elevations increase), depth to water increases, until about 20 m (66 ft) below the surface. Most wells with depth-to- water values greater than 20 m (66 ft) are located at slightly higher elevations to the north of Abiquiu and Medanales and in the area where El Rito Creek feeds into the Rio Chama. Most of these wells are likely completed in the Tesuque Formation (Chama-El Rito or Ojo Caliente Members). The contoured water table in the Abiquiu and Medanales area (Fig. 3.15) shows that the shallow alluvial aquifer is being recharged from the surrounding mountains. This can be discerned from contoured water-table lines running parallel to the valley slopes on the north side of the valley. 62 O P E N - F I L E R E P O R T 6 3 0 : E V A L U A T I O N O F G R O U N D W A T E R R E S O U R C E S F O R C O M M U N I T I E S I N R I O A R R I B A C O U N T Y 36\u00b020' 36\u00b015' 36\u00b010' -106\u00b010' -106\u00b015' -106\u00b020' 5000 402 5000 401 5000 400 0000 38 5000 37 0 1 2 Miles 0 1 2 Kilometers study area intermittent stream perennial stream road town county line NMOSE well San Juan Mountains San Juan Mountains El Rito Abiquiu Medanales \u00a3 \u00a4 84 Rio Chama Rio Chama El Rito El Rito A r r o y o d el C obr e A r r o y o d el C obr e A r r o yo d e S o lda do s A r r o yo d e S o lda do s Dixon Dixon Abiquiu Abiquiu RIO ARRIBA CO Rio G r a n d e R i o C h a m a 84 Figure 3.9.

These gaining and losing reaches, the location of which also changes with time, are controlled by local flow conditions in the Rio Chama. Generally, the flow through the shallow alluvium is parallel to the valley\u2019s axis and slightly toward the river. The slope of the water table is fairly shallow at around a 1% gradient (1 m of head drop over 100 m of lateral distance). The saturated thickness of the alluvial aquifer is between 10 and 20 m (33 and 66 ft; Fig. 3.16). The water table near El Rito and Las Placitas (Fig. 3.15) is different compared to that in the other study areas because El Rito Creek is only a perennial stream in the uppermost reaches of the valley. In the northernmost section of the valley where El Rito Creek flows out of the Tusas Mountains, the valley is quite narrow, and the water table appears to show gaining conditions (groundwater discharging to El Rito Creek). As the valley widens, the water-table contours flatten out and run perpendicular to the river channel. Farther southeast in the valley, the contours start to bend downstream, indicating the river is losing water to the shallow aquifer. The gradient of the water table in this area is around 2%. The saturated thickness in the El Rito valley is greatest near the center of the basin. Mapping shows there may be as much as 30 m (100 ft) of saturated alluvial aquifer (Fig. 3.16). Figure 3.17 shows depth-to-water measurements for wells inventoried in the study area, with most wells exhibiting depth-to-water values of less than 20 m (66 ft); this includes all wells inventoried in and around El Rito and in the immediate vicinity of Abiquiu.

The gradient of the water table in this area is around 2%. The saturated thickness in the El Rito valley is greatest near the center of the basin. Mapping shows there may be as much as 30 m (100 ft) of saturated alluvial aquifer (Fig. 3.16). Figure 3.17 shows depth-to-water measurements for wells inventoried in the study area, with most wells exhibiting depth-to-water values of less than 20 m (66 ft); this includes all wells inventoried in and around El Rito and in the immediate vicinity of Abiquiu.

The greatest depths to water (in RA-007, RA-079, and RA-081) were measured north of the mouth of El Rito Creek among the large group of deep wells shown in Figure 3.11. Table 3.1 shows depth-to-water measurements for all wells inventoried for this study. If available, total well depth, depth of water-bearing unit, and water-bearing unit description are included. From the depth-to-water measurements and total well depths, we were able to determine whether the well tapped the shallow alluvial aquifer or an aquifer from the deeper system. This division between shallow aquifer system waters and deep aquifer system waters is used below in the discussion of water chemistry. Note that wells RA-013 and RA-082 are screened in both the shallow alluvial aquifer and the deeper system. Water level observations in an 18-m-deep (60-ft) well (WL-0237) about 121 m (400 ft) from the Rio Chama suggest the water level of the Rio Chama ultimately controls the groundwater levels in the alluvial aquifer. The shallow alluvial aquifer stores water during high flows and releases water over the course of several months in the winter and spring (Fig. 3.18). Figure 3.13.

In general, water quality in the study area is quite good, with about 70% of the samples exhibiting TDS concentrations less than 500 mg/L. TDS concentrations for shallow aquifer system waters averaged 466 mg/L. Only three samples exhibited TDS concentrations greater than 1,000 mg/L, which is the upper boundary of what is referred to as fresh water (USGS, 2019). Water produced by well RA-010 in the shallow aquifer system stands out with a TDS concentration of 2,760 mg/L, which is the second-highest TDS value after that of the deep aquifer system water sample from RA-007, which had a TDS concentration of 4,200 mg/L (Fig. 3.19). The average TDS concentration for deep aquifer system waters is 891 mg/L. However, about 50% of deep aquifer system wells produced water with TDS concentrations less than 500 mg/L. Table 3.3 shows concentrations of constituents for which at least one water sample was found to exceed a primary or secondary MCL. We tested all groundwater samples for the presence or absence of total coliform and E. coli. One water sample showed the presence of both total coliform and E. coli, and five water samples showed just the presence of total coliform. All wells producing these waters were completed in the shallow alluvial aquifer. Figure 3.20 shows arsenic concentrations for water samples. Several wells completed in both the shallow and deep aquifer systems produced water that exceeded the primary MCL for arsenic (0.01 mg/L). 17.0 17.2 17.4 17.6 17.8 18.0 18.2 18.4 18.6 18.8 19.0 5.2 5.3 5.4 5.5 5.6 5.7 0 200 400 600 800 1000 1200 1400 1600 1800 2000 Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul 2021 2022 2023 Depth to Water ft bgs m bgs Discharge (cfs) Rio Chama Discharge at Abiquiu Dam vs. Depth to Water in WL-0237 study area Dixon Dixon Abiquiu Abiquiu El Rito El Rito RIO ARRIBA CO TAOS CO Rio G r an d e R io C h a m a 84 0 5 Miles 0 5 Kilometers 8287000 Abiquiu Dam WL-0237 Figure 3.18.

All other water samples that had arsenic concentrations exceeding the primary MCL had arsenic concentrations less than 0.02 mg/L. Interestingly, RA-007 and RA-010, the wells that produced water with the highest TDS concentrations, had arsenic concentrations of 0.0053 mg/L and less than 0.0025 mg/L, respectively. Figure 3.21 shows uranium concentrations for water samples. All five wells that produced water exceeding the primary MCL of 0.03 mg/L are completed in the deep aquifer system. The two deep aquifer system wells with the highest uranium concentrations are RA-007 (highest TDS concentration of 4,200 mg/L) and RA-006 (TDS concentration of 716 mg/L) at 0.133 mg/L and 0.155 mg/L, respectively. Figure 3.22 shows fluoride concentrations for all water samples. Two wells, RA-082 (shallow and deep aquifer systems) and RA-006 (deep aquifer system), produced water that exceeds the primary MCL of 4 mg/L. Wells RA-010 (shallow aquifer system) and RA-019 (deep aquifer system) produced water exceeding the secondary MCL of 2 mg/L. The remaining cations we measured include iron and manganese (Figs. 3.23 and 3.24, respectively). Iron concentrations that exceeded the secondary MCL of 0.3 mg/L were observed for water produced by wells completed in the shallow aquifer (Fig. 3.23), and most of these wells (RA-010, RA-004, RA-040, and RA-018) are located in the Abiquiu area. In El Rito, the only well that produced water that exceeded the secondary MCL for iron was RA-087, which is the northernmost well sampled in the El Rito area. Both iron and manganese are relatively heavy minerals that can be concentrated in sediments deposited by running water in streams and rivers. Therefore, manganese concentrations (Fig. 3.24) that exceeded the secondary MCL of 0.05 mg/L were produced by most of the same wells (RA-010, RA-004, RA-040, RA-011, RA-018, and RA-087) that showed exceedance of the secondary iron MCL.

The deep aquifer system wells in Medanales (RA-007 and RA-008) exhibit high TDS concentrations and high relative Na+ (90% and 92%, respectively). However, four deep aquifer system wells (RA-082, RA-085, RA-019, and RA-006) are from all three areas of interest and exhibit extremely high relative Na+ concentrations (>98% of cations) and low TDS concentrations. These are the same waters with pH values that exceed the secondary MCL of 8.5 (Table 3.3). For anions (Fig. 3.25, right triangle), all but four water samples exhibit HCO3 - as the dominant anion. The shallow aquifer system well RA-010 again stands out because it is the only water sample with SO4 2- as the dominant anion. To a lesser degree, the shallow aquifer system well RA-018 and the deep aquifer system well RA-006 show elevated relative SO4 2- concentrations. RA-006, one of the wells that produced high Na+, high pH, and relatively low TDS concentrations, also shows the highest relative Cl- concentration. The shallow aquifer system well RA-075 exhibits the second-highest relative Cl- concentration. 77 C H A P T E R 3 : A S S E S S M E N T O F G R O U N D W A T E R R E S O U R C E S F O R T H E C O M M U N I T I E S O F E L R I T O , A B I Q U I U , A N D M E D A N A L E S San Juan Mountains San Juan Mountains El Rito Abiquiu Medanales El Rito Abiquiu Medanales \u00a3 \u00a4 84 Rio Chama El Rito A r r o y o d e l Co b r e A r r o y o d e S ol da d o s 0 1 2 Miles 0 1 2 Kilometers shallow aquifer well study area intermittent stream perennial stream road town county line deep aquifer well spring Arsenic (mg/L) <0.005 0.005\u20130.01 0.01\u20130.02 0.02\u20130.05 >0.05 primary MCL = 0.01 mg/L RA-091 RA-074 RA-089 RA-073 RA-085 RA-084 RA-083 RA-082 RA-081 RA-080 RA-079 RA-076 RA-075 RA-014 RA-039 RA-038 RA-013 RA-042 RA-041 RA-004 RA-040 RA-009 RA-01 9 RA-01 8 RA-01 6 RA-01 0 RA-008 RA-007 RA-006 RA-1 004 RA-087 WL-0237 RA-01 1 RA-091 RA-074 RA-089 RA-073 RA-085 RA-084 RA-083 RA-082 RA-081 RA-080 RA-079 RA-076 RA-075 RA-014 RA-039 RA-038 RA-013 RA-042 RA-041 RA-004 RA-040 RA-009 RA-01 9 RA-01 8 RA-01 6 RA-01 0 RA-008 RA-007 RA-006 RA-1 004 RA-087 WL-0237 RA-01 1 study area Dixon Dixon Abiquiu Abiquiu RIO ARRIBA CO Rio G r an d e R i o C h a m a 84 Figure 3.20.

Most shallow wells produce water of Ca2+ type, and this is especially true for the El Rito area. In the Abiquiu and Medanales areas, some shallow aquifer system waters are identified as both mixed-cation and Na+ water types. As mentioned above, there are no Ca2+ water types for deep aquifer system waters. Figure 3.27 shows TDS as a function of relative Na+ concentrations (as a proportion of cations, meq/L). As seen in the Piper diagram in Figure 3.25, the cation compositions for all water samples are relatively low in magnesium (<25% of cations) and define a roughly linear trend between Ca2+ water types and Na+ water types. Again, shallow aquifer system waters with low TDS and Ca2+ as the dominant cation are likely very young waters that were recharged in the nearby mountains to the north. Two processes are likely to cause groundwater to evolve from a Ca2+ water type toward a Na+ water type: (1) mixing with other water sources with high relative Na+ concentrations and (2) cation exchange.

The arrows show different chemical evolution pathways, with the red arrow representing the mixing of waters with different TDS concentrations. The purple arrow represents cation exchange, which does not significantly affect the TDS concentrations. The graph in Figure 3.27 shows examples of both mixing and cation exchange. The increase in relative Na+ concentration accompanied by significant increase in TDS indicates mixing with a groundwater source that has high TDS and a Na+ water type. This is most apparent for shallow aquifer system wells in the Abiquiu area (red arrow) with a relative Na+ concentration between 0.3 and 0.7; these are apparently mixing with groundwaters chemically similar to waters produced by deep aquifer system wells, such as RA-007 and RA-008. Most shallow aquifer system waters in the El Rito and Medanales areas are Ca2+ water types (low relative Na+ concentrations) and show very small increases in TDS between the relative Na+ concentrations of 0.1 and 0.4. In this case, increases in relative Na+ concentrations are mostly due to cation exchange reactions, which are not expected to increase TDS (purple arrow).

The purple arrow represents cation exchange, which does not significantly affect the TDS concentrations. The graph in Figure 3.27 shows examples of both mixing and cation exchange. The increase in relative Na+ concentration accompanied by significant increase in TDS indicates mixing with a groundwater source that has high TDS and a Na+ water type. This is most apparent for shallow aquifer system wells in the Abiquiu area (red arrow) with a relative Na+ concentration between 0.3 and 0.7; these are apparently mixing with groundwaters chemically similar to waters produced by deep aquifer system wells, such as RA-007 and RA-008. Most shallow aquifer system waters in the El Rito and Medanales areas are Ca2+ water types (low relative Na+ concentrations) and show very small increases in TDS between the relative Na+ concentrations of 0.1 and 0.4. In this case, increases in relative Na+ concentrations are mostly due to cation exchange reactions, which are not expected to increase TDS (purple arrow). Interestingly, it appears that the five deep aquifer system wells in the Medanales area with TDS concentrations less than 250 mg/L have relative Na+ concentrations ranging from 0.2 to 0.7. These waters (in wells RA-013, RA-038, RA-039, RA-079, and RA-081) may come from the same formation (Chama-El Rito Member of the Tesuque Formation) and are discussed in more detail below. The graph in Figure 3.27 also clearly shows waters with high pH and low TDS aligned close to the relative Na+ concentration of 1 (about 98\u201399% of cations), with TDS concentrations ranging from 350 to 1,000 mg/L. These wells are all screened in the deep aquifer. Initial analyses suggest this water chemistry is due to the dissolution of feldspars, which range from about 5 to 40% in the Abiquiu Formation and are dominantly plagioclase (Vazzana and Ingersoll, 1981). 85 C H A P T E R 3 : A S S E S S M E N T O F G R O U N D W A T E R R E S O U R C E S F O R T H E C O M M U N I T I E S O F E L R I T O , A B I Q U I U , A N D M E D A N A L E S Figure 3.28 shows additional evidence of groundwaters with high TDS and chemical signatures similar to those of RA-010 and RA-007, likely upwelling along fractures and faults and mixing with shallow aquifer system waters; these significantly impact shallow groundwater quality in the Abiquiu area. The graph shows the molar ratio (ratio of molar concentrations, mol/L) of HCO3 -/SO4 2- versus SO4 2- concentrations (in meq/L). The top graph presents all the data, showing water from RA-010 with the highest SO4 2- concentration of 31.9 meq/L (1,530 mg/L). The estimated mixing line (dashed) suggests that a small amount of water chemically similar to that sampled from RA-010 is mixing with most water in the shallow aquifer system. The bottom graph in Figure 3.28 zooms in to show other possible mixing processes. The dashed line and arrows show that groundwater with a chemical signature similar to that of water from RA-007 appears to be mixing into the shallow aquifer system, impacting water quality for shallow groundwaters, especially in the Abiquiu area. The deep aquifer system waters with low TDS labeled in Figure 3.28 are the same waters (solid purple triangles) shown in Figure 3.27 that show a range of relative sodium concentrations but low TDS concentrations. Groundwater Ages Figures 3.29 and 3.30 show that tritium concentrations above 1 TU are observed for waters produced by shallow wells in the El Rito and Abiquiu areas, which all exhibit depth-to-water measurements less than 10 m (33 ft) below the surface. In general, carbon-14 data agree with tritium data. With the exception of well RA-010, all waters with tritium concentrations greater than 1 TU exhibit apparent carbon-14 ages less than 1,000 YBP. Well RA-010, which produces water with an apparent carbon-14 age of 11,930 YBP, is located just east of the Ca\u00f1ones fault (Figs. 3.5 and 3.10); this fault juxtaposes the Permian Cutler Formation and the Oligocene Ritito Conglomerate (about 27 million years old). In this area, the Todilto Formation is very close to the surface and likely the main source of shallow groundwater. However, a tritium concentration of 1.37 TU indicates young water from the Rio Chama recharges the shallow aquifer, mixing with older water in this area. Well RA-075, the southernmost well sampled, is located in an area where the Tesuque Formation is very close to the surface (Fig. 3.6) and where the Tesuque is probably the source of shallow groundwater in that area. However, with a tritium concentration of 0.37 TU, a small amount of young river water apparently does recharge the shallow alluvial aquifer in this area as well. As discussed in more detail below, several deep aquifer system waters with similar apparent ages (10,000\u201315,000 YBP) seem to also be coming from the Chama-El Rito Member of the Tesuque Formation. The water sample exhibiting the oldest apparent age of 22,740 YBP is from RA-006, which also appears to be completed in the Chama-El Rito Member. Stable Isotopes of Water As shown in Figure 1.6, the stable isotopic composition of all groundwater samples plots within the range of values expected for winter precipitation. Figure 3.31 shows that the groundwater system is quite complicated, with different water sources evaporating and mixing. These data allow us to identify the three water samples (RA-1004, RA-016, and RA-009) that appear to have been recharged in the Jemez Mountains to the south. RA-1004 is the spring located up Abiquiu Creek that supplies Abiquiu with community water; RA-016 is located close to the mouth of Abiquiu Creek, where Abiquiu Creek feeds into the Rio Chama; and RA-009 is located in a small drainage coming from the south.

Note how the shallow groundwater wells near El Rito extend rightward from the Rocky Mountains meteoric water line. This indicates that shallow aquifer system groundwater in much of the El Rito area is recharged by water that has undergone evaporation, including water from El Rito Creek, irrigation return flow, and water in the acequias. 86 O P E N - F I L E R E P O R T 6 3 0 : E V A L U A T I O N O F G R O U N D W A T E R R E S O U R C E S F O R C O M M U N I T I E S I N R I O A R R I B A C O U N T Y 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 SO4 2- (meq/L) Abiquiu El Rito Medanales Low-TDS deep wells Low-TDS deep wells RA-006 RA-010 High SO4 RA-007 RA-008 RA-1004 Abiquiu Spring 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 HCO3 -/SO4 2- SO4 2- (meq/L) Abiquiu El Rito Medanales RA-006 RA-007 RA-008 RA-1004 Abiquiu Spring HCO3 -/SO4 2- Figure 3.28.

They show larger degrees of evaporation, with the southernmost well (RA-075) showing the largest degree. This indicates water originating from the Rio Chama has undergone evaporation before recharging the shallow alluvial aquifer. In this area, the Rio Chama may sometimes be a losing stream, where stream water that has undergone evaporation seeps into the streambed and recharges the aquifer. The isotopically lightest groundwaters, with the exception of RA-010, are all deep aquifer system waters based on their depth and depth-to-water measurements; these include wells RA-007, RA-085, RA-019, and RA-038. These waters appear to be separated from most of the shallow aquifer system and are likely related to Pleistocene recharge identified in the San Luis Basin by Drakos et al. (2004). These waters represent older recharge under a different climatic regime. Many researchers have observed that some old groundwaters, likely recharged tens of thousands of years ago, exhibit much lighter isotopic compositions than those observed today due to cooler climatic conditions in past ice ages. Interestingly, most deep aquifer system waters in the Medanales area appear to represent recharge that originally plotted along the global meteoric water line but shows evidence of the mixing of a small amount of Pleistocene water that changed the isotopic composition toward lighter values (red arrows in Fig. 3.31), with the result being compositions lying in between that of pure Pleistocene recharge (red circle in Fig. 3.21) and the global meteoric line.

In general, the shallow alluvial aquifer in the Abiquiu area is very limited in size but has relatively high permeability. Existing wells in the area that tap deeper aquifers show that water levels in the wells are much higher than the elevation of the apparent water-bearing unit, indicating these aquifers are confined and under pressure. However, while the deep aquifer system appears to be confined to some degree, the water levels in the wells are still lower than the surface of the shallow alluvial aquifer (water table). In the presence of open fractures and faults, this deep aquifer system water can move upward into the shallow aquifer system. Characterization of Shallow Alluvial Aquifers The shallow alluvial aquifers that supply groundwater for residents and communities in the Abiquiu Valley study area are located in the valley bottom adjacent to the Rio Chama and El Rito Creek. The aquifer is composed of Quaternary sediments, including Quaternary alluvium and young terrace deposits in the El Rito area and Quaternary alluvium along the Rio Chama (Figs. 3.13 and 3.14). The width of the aquifer is limited by the lateral extent of these deposits. The widest portion of the shallow aquifer is in the vicinity of El Rito, which is where the greatest saturated thickness is measured (Fig. 3.16). To the south toward the mouth of El Rito Creek, the shallow alluvial aquifer is not well defined because there are very few existing wells in this area (Fig. 3.13). The water-table contours along the Rio Chama show a Figure 3.31. Stable isotopic composition of water samples. The dashed arrows indicate different processes, such as the mixing of different water sources and evaporation.

The fault zone in the center appears to be cemented, resulting in compartmentalization.

Water level data used to construct water level elevation contours span from the 1970s to the present, and we know groundwater levels in this area can fluctuate well over 0.3 m (1 ft) due to fluctuations in the Rio Chama (Fig. 3.18). Near El Rito, where the hydraulic gradient is steeper, water level contours can be identified despite the uncertainty of the water level data. However, in areas with very flat gradients (<1%), like those along the Rio Chama, these uncertainties make it difficult to define water level contours. Furthermore, because the flow in the Rio Chama in the Abiquiu Valley is controlled by releases from Abiquiu Reservoir, this reach of the Rio Chama likely loses water to the aquifer during high flows and gains water back from the aquifer during low flows. In general, groundwater flows parallel to the Rio Chama and El Rito Creek, and saturated thickness ranges from 20 to 30 m (66\u201398 ft). Geochemistry In general, water quality in the study area is quite good, with about 70% of the samples exhibiting TDS concentrations less than 500 mg/L. TDS concentrations for shallow aquifer system waters averaged 466 mg/L. Only three samples exhibited TDS concentrations greater than 1,000 mg/L. Water produced by the shallow aquifer system well RA-010 stands out, with a TDS concentration of 2,760 mg/L; this is the second-highest TDS value after the deep aquifer system water sample from RA-007. Unlike all other water samples, RA-010 exhibits SO4 2- as the dominant anion (Fig. 3.25) and shows evidence of the dissolution of the mineral gypsum, which does not occur in alluvial or Santa Fe Group sediments in the area. Well RA-010 is located on the western edge of the study area just east of the Ca\u00f1ones fault (Fig. 3.10). In that area, the Jurassic Todilto/Entrada Formation, which does contain gypsum, is very close to the surface. With a total depth of 15.24 m (50 ft) and a depth to water of 1.34 m (4.4 ft), the well appears to be completed in the shallow alluvium. If this is the case, then this water, rich in SO4 2- and with high TDS, is likely moving upward along fractures and faults into the shallow alluvial aquifer. There is evidence that a small amount of this water is mixing into the shallow aquifer system, affecting water quality for almost all shallow aquifer system wells (Fig. 3.28). There are slight differences between the shallow aquifer system of the El Rito area and that of the Abiquiu-Medanales area. The shallow waters farthest to the north in the El Rito area have TDS concentrations less than 300 mg/L. Shallow wells along El Rito Creek farther to the south have slightly higher TDS concentrations, mostly due to evaporation in the stream as it recharges the shallow aquifer. Other shallow aquifer system waters along the Rio Chama have TDS concentrations between 250 and 500 mg/L (Fig. 3.19). The cation water type for these waters ranges from Ca2+ to Na+ water types. These waters evolve toward Na+ water type due to cation exchange and mixing with deep aquifer system waters with higher TDS concentrations and high Na+ concentrations relative to total cations (Fig. 3.27). These shallow aquifer system waters also appear to be recharged by seepage from the Rio Chama when river levels are higher than the local water table or from acequias transporting water for irrigation. Both river and acequia waters would be expected to show the evaporation signature observed in shallow groundwater farther downstream. Several shallow aquifer system wells along the Rio Chama in the Abiquiu and Medanales areas produce water that exceeds the primary MCL for arsenic (0.01 mg/L; Fig. 3.20). All shallow aquifer system waters in the El Rito area are below the MCL. The deep aquifer system well RA-082 exhibits the highest arsenic concentration of 0.05 mg/L. While some naturally occurring arsenic may be present in waters from the deep aquifer system, it appears that arsenic is also present in groundwater in the shallow alluvial aquifer. Water quality for almost all shallow aquifer system waters appears to be impacted to at least a small degree by mixing with groundwater with high TDS from deeper aquifers upwelling into the shallow aquifer system. This upwelling may be controlled by faults (acting as a barrier to flow), fractures in shallow bedrock, or the three-dimensional arrangement of low-permeability and high-permeability sediments in the Tesuque Formation. Shallow groundwater in the Abiquiu area is significantly affected by mixing with a small amount of water chemically similar to water sampled from RA-010 and RA-007 (Fig. 3.28). 92 O P E N - F I L E R E P O R T 6 3 0 : E V A L U A T I O N O F G R O U N D W A T E R R E S O U R C E S F O R C O M"

With the exception of well RA-010, all other shallow aquifer system waters plot on or near one of two apparent evaporation lines. When precipitation with an isotopic composition that plots on a local meteoric water line makes its way to a local stream, it will undergo evaporation to some degree. As the water evaporates, the stable isotopic composition of the water in the stream becomes isotopically heavier and evolves along an evaporation line. If the stream is recharging the shallow alluvial aquifer, the isotopic composition of groundwater will plot along an evaporation line that connects it to its initial composition before it evaporated. We interpret an evaporation trend for the three samples on the southern flank of the Rio Chama near Abiquiu (Fig. 3.33). The location of the spring that supplies Abiquiu with water (RA-1004) indicates that its water likely originates as precipitation in the Jemez Mountains. The fact that the isotopic composition of this water plots above the Rocky Mountains meteoric water line indicates that it is likely plotting on a different local meteoric water line, representative of different environmental conditions (such as relative humidity) that presumably are present in the northern Jemez Mountains. Near the headwaters of Abiquiu Creek flows, the water is likely isotopically similar to water discharging from the spring RA-1004. As it flows on the surface, the water undergoes evaporation before infiltrating through the streambed to recharge the shallow alluvial aquifer. Well RA-016, which produces water with an isotopic composition plotting on the evaporation line, is located on the south side of the Rio Chama near the mouth of Abiquiu Creek, located approximately 8 km (5 mi) downstream of RA-1004. -130 -125 -120 -115 -110 -105 -100 -95 -90 -85 -80 -75 -70 -65 -60 -16 -15.5 -15 -14.5 -14 -13.5 -13 -12.5 -12 -11.5 -11 -10.5 -10 \u03b418O (\u2030) \u03b4D (\u2030) Rocky Mountains meteoric water line (Nordstrom et al., 2007) Evaporation trend Abiquiu Spring Recharged in the Jemez Mountains Recharged from El Rito Creek Recharged from Rio Chama RA-010 RA-1004 RA-016 RA-041 RA-075 Abiquiu well El Rito well Medanales well shallow aquifer Figure 3.33.

Shallow aquifer system waters in El Rito with isotopic compositions plotting on the Rocky Mountains meteoric water line represent relatively unevaporated water in El Rito Creek. Groundwaters with isotopic compositions that plot along the lighter section of the evaporation line were recharged by water from El Rito Creek that had undergone evaporation.

There are also periods of time when river flow rates stabilize and equilibrate with the water table, such as August through November 2022. Characterization of the Deep Aquifer Systems Most deep aquifer system wells appear to be completed in the Tesuque and Abiquiu Formations, both of which are part of the Santa Fe Group. The Chama-El Rito Member of the Tesuque Formation is the primary deep aquifer in this area, with some wells being screened (at least partly) in the Ojo Caliente area. The TDS for deep aquifer system waters varies widely, ranging from 190 to 4,200 mg/L (Figs. 3.19 and 3.25). With the exception of a few deep aquifer system water samples, all deep aquifer system waters are dominantly Na+-type waters, with Na+ representing over 90% of cations (Fig. 3.25, left triangular graph, bottom-right corner). The following discussion focuses on chemistry data for the deep aquifer system wells RA-007, RA-006, RA-008, RA-079, RA-081, RA-013, RA-038, and RA-039 (Fig. 3.34), all of which are completed in the Chama-El Rito Member of the Tesuque Formation. Wells RA-007, RA-006, and RA-008 are separated from the other wells by El Rito Creek, which has a long fault paralleling the creek to the west (Fig. 3.3). This subset of deep aquifer system wells exhibits the full range of TDS. Water produced by wells west of El Rito Creek (RA-006, RA-007, and RA-008) differs significantly from that produced by the deep aquifer system wells east of the creek (RA-079, RA-081, RA-038, RA-039, and RA-013) in several ways. Table 3.4 shows that water level elevations for wells to the west range from 1,820 to 1,870 m (5,971\u20136,135 ft) above sea level, while the eastern wells exhibit lower water level elevations ranging from 1,757 to 1,780 m (5,764\u20135,840 ft). Other observed differences include TDS concentrations (Fig. 3.34) and water type (Fig. 3.35). Western wells produce water with TDS concentrations greater than 500 mg/L, and eastern wells produce water with TDS concentrations less than 250 mg/L. The Piper diagram in Figure 3.35 shows that the eastern wells have HCO3 - as the dominant anion, but the cations show an evolution of water chemistry from Ca2+ water type to Na+ water type, indicative of cation exchange. For the wells to the west of El Rito Creek, all show Na+ as the dominant cation. All western wells except RA-006 exhibit HCO3 - as the dominant anion. RA-006 is the only well other than RA-010 to have a significant amount of SO4 2-. The only western well tested for carbon-14 is RA-006, which has the oldest water age of 22,740 YBP. Water from the eastern wells RA-079 and RA-081 shows apparent ages of 9,360 and 11,440 YBP, respectively. 94 O P E N - F I L E R E P O R T 6 3 0 : E V A L U A T I O N O F G R O U N D W A T E R R E S O U R C E S F O R C O M M U N I T I E S I N R I O A R R I B A C O U N T Y 36\u00b012'30\" 36\u00b010' -106\u00b010' -106\u00b012'30\" -106\u00b015' -106\u00b017'30\" 0000 401 5000 400 Abiquiu Abiquiu Medanales Medanales \u00a3 \u00a4 84 RA-081 RA-081 RA-079 RA-079 RA-039 RA-039 RA-038 RA-038 RA-013 RA-013 RA-008 RA-008 RA-007 RA-007 RA-006 RA-006 Ri o C h a m a E l Rit o C r e e k 0 1 2 Miles 0 1 2 Kilometers fault road intermittent stream perennial stream town county line Total Dissolved Solids (mg/L) <250 250\u2013500 500\u20131,000 1,000\u20132,000 >2,000 Medanales Medanales Dixon Dixon Abiquiu Abiquiu RIO ARRIBA CO Rio G r a n d e R i o C h a m a 84 study area map extent Figure 3.34.

Location of deep aquifer system water with low TDS, along with other wells in the area that were studied as potential supply wells. Unlike the eastern wells, the western wells RA-006, RA-007, and RA-008 produce water that exceeds the primary MCL for uranium (Fig. 3.21). Although the wells east of El Rito Creek produce old water from several hundreds of feet below the surface, it is of excellent quality, with very low TDS concentrations. For this set of wells, the two northern wells RA-079 and RA-081 are approximately 7 km (4.3 mi) from the southern wells RA-013, RA-038, and RA-039, and all of these wells produce water with similar TDS concentrations, similar anion compositions, and cation compositions that show different degrees of cation exchange. It appears that the west-down fault adjoining lower El Rito Creek on the west acts as a notable hydrogeologic barrier separating these two types of groundwaters. The more deleterious quality of groundwater on the west may reflect closer proximity to uplifted bedrock groundwater sources or closer proximity to major fault zones that bound the western side of the Rio Grande rift. The water-bearing unit from which the eastern wells are extracting water may possibly be continuous over a large area. This hypothesis merits further research. Water produced by RA-006 is representative of a unique water type, with relative Na+ concentrations greater than 98% of cations; this is also observed for the deep aquifer system wells RA-082, RA-085, and RA-019 (Fig. 3.25). These waters also exhibit high pH values (Table 3.2) and tend to have high uranium concentrations (Fig. 3.21). Geohydrology Associates, Inc. (1979) described the \u201cLas Placitas Well,\u201d shown on the geologic cross section in Figure 3.4. The exploratory hole was 731 ft deep, penetrated the Abiquiu Formation, and produced water very chemically similar to water produced by RA-082 and RA-085, with a TDS concentration of 220 mg/L and a pH of 8.87. Wells RA-085, RA-082, and RA-019 all appear to be completed in the Abiquiu Formation, which is the oldest member of the Santa Fe Group. This unit probably has a different lithology (perhaps a high proportion of initial sodium feldspars) that results in this unique groundwater chemistry. 97 C H A P T E R 3 : A S S E S S M E N T O F G R O U N D W A T E R R E S O U R C E S F O R T H E C O M M U N I T I E S O F E L R I T O , A B I Q U I U , A N D M E D A N A L E S FUTURE WORK In addition to the recommended future work described in Chapter 1, further study of the deep aquifer system wells completed in the Chama-El Rito Member of the Tesuque Formation on the east side of El Rito Creek is also suggested. Of the deep aquifer system waters analyzed for this study, the waters sampled from wells RA-079, RA-081, RA-038, RA-039, and RA-013 are of good quality and have low TDS concentrations (Fig. 3.36).

The groundwater appears to flow south, possibly along north-south trending faults. While these wells appear to have limited capacity, as most pump 15 to 30 gpm, the water quality is excellent, and it is worth looking at this water source in more detail. 98 O P E N - F I L E R E P O R T 6 3 0 : E V A L U A T I O N O F G R O U N D W A T E R R E S O U R C E S F O R C O M M U N I T I E S I N R I O A R R I B A C O U N T Y Ethan Mamer collecting a water quality sample from a well near Dixon, New Mexico.

Dixon had a population of 938 in 2020 (U.S. Census Bureau, 2024). Groundwater use in Dixon is primarily domestic and public supply. Surface water in the community is used for irrigation; as in other nearby communities, surface water is distributed by a network of acequias. Dixon MDWCA is the public water system for Dixon and serves 500 users, currently with one active well. Other nearby communities, such as Embudo, Canjilon, and Ojo Sarco, also have MDWCAs that use groundwater. Local Geology As in the other study areas, the youngest geologic unit is late Quaternary-age alluvium that underlies modern valleys and hosts the shallow aquifer. This unit consists of sand, silty-clayey sand, gravelly sand, and sandy gravel. The sediment is uncemented and weakly consolidated. Maximum thickness is up to around 30 m (100 ft), and the alluvium tends to thin toward the valley margins. Dixon stratigraphy (Table 4.1) is somewhat similar to that of the northern Espa\u00f1ola Basin to the west. The primary sedimentary unit in the area is the Tertiary Tesuque Formation of the Santa Fe Group, which comprises basin-fill sediments associated with the opening of the Rio Grande rift. The Tesuque Formation is subdivided into four member-rank units described by Steinpress (1980, 1981), Koning and Aby (2003), and Aby and Koning (2004). The following description is synthesized from these previous works. The four member-rank units of interest in the Tesuque Formation are (youngest to oldest) the Cejita, Ojo Caliente, Dixon, and Chama-El Rito Members; their distribution is shown in Figure 4.2. The Cejita Member is composed of at least 80 m (262 m) of sandy, pebble- to boulder-gravels with sparse lenses of coarse sand (Aby and Koning, 2004); this unit unconformably overlies either the Ojo Caliente Sandstone or the Dixon Member. The Ojo Caliente Sandstone is an eolian facies (sand dunes deposited by wind) made of weakly cemented fine to coarse sand. Similar to the Cejita Member, the Dixon Member shows channel and floodplain deposits, but the gravel size is smaller, and overall the unit is finer grained (15% mudstone per Steinpress [1980]).

Both the Cejita and Dixon are interpreted to reflect fluvial deposition of Proterozoic and Paleozoic material eroded off the western flanks of the adjacent Sangre de Cristo Mountains. Beneath the Dixon Member is the Chama-El Rito Member of the Tesuque Formation, which is generally composed of channel deposits of volcaniclastic pebbly sandstone, pebble conglomerate, and sandstone. This member is relatively more gravelly and coarser than the Chama-El Rito Member exposed near the Medanales study area. The Cejita and Ojo Caliente Members are overall coarser grained and less consolidated than the Dixon and Chama-El Rito Members and are likely more permeable. However, these coarser members are located 110\u2013150 m (360\u2013490 ft) above Embudo Creek and do not supply water to current residents, although several springs are located near the contact of the Ojo Caliente Member and underlying Dixon Member. Undivided Proterozoic basement rocks composed mostly of quartzite and schist crop out just west of Dixon (Fig. 4.2). The geologic cross section (Fig. 4.3) shows that this crystalline rock occurs at relatively shallow depths east of this outcrop and west of the Embudo fault zone, where it has an approximate maximum depth of 200 m (656 ft) below the surface. On the east end of the valley, gravelly strata at the base of the Chama-El Rito Member (Tesuque Formation) overlie Proterozoic granitic rocks. A major geologic structure in the Dixon area, the Embudo fault, may have a significant impact on water quality. Faults are sparse east of the Embudo fault, in comparison to intensely faulted terrain near Medanales and Abiquiu. Several significant strike- and dip-slip splays of the Embudo fault zone generally strike northeast-southwest through the Dixon area. This pattern is interpreted as a result of a transfer zone between the Espa\u00f1ola Basin and the San Luis Basin to the northeast (Muehlberger, 1979; Aldrich, 1986; Koning and Aby, 2003; Koning et al., 2004b, 2013; Goteti et al., 2013). These two basins represent a right stepover of the Rio Grande rift. This stepover and the Embudo fault are aligned along the Jemez lineament, which is a northeast-southwest- trending crustal flaw that coincides with a series of volcanic centers extending from southeastern Arizona to northeastern New Mexico (Mayo, 1958; Aldrich, 1986). The Embudo fault zone deforms rocks of the Tertiary Tesuque Formation and also exposes Proterozoic metamorphic rocks at the surface just west of Dixon (Koning and Aby, 2003). Here, Proterozoic basement rocks are in both depositional and fault contact with Cenozoic sedimentary deposits. Groundwater that has a long residence time in crystalline rock can naturally exceed chemical standards for drinking water. A fault that displaces crystalline rock like the Proterozoic basement rocks near Dixon may act as a conduit that discharges poor-quality water at the surface. Local Hydrogeology Dixon is located along Embudo Creek about 3.2 km (2 mi) from the confluence of Embudo Creek and the Rio Grande. The nearest climate station is about 32 km (20 mi) to the southwest in Espa\u00f1ola. The average annual temperature is 11\u00b0C (51.6\u00b0F; Western Regional Climate Center, 2024). Winter temperatures average 0.2\u00b0C (32.3\u00b0F), with lows reaching less than -10\u00b0C (14\u00b0F). Summer temperatures average 21.6\u00b0C (70.9\u00b0F), with highs reaching around 30\u00b0C (86\u00b0F). Average precipitation in Rio Arriba County displays general seasonal and spatial trends, where it is usually greater at higher elevations, during summer, and to the north. Seasonal variability occurs due to summer monsoon storms bringing moisture from the Gulf of Mexico and Gulf of California"

Average precipitation in Rio Arriba County displays general seasonal and spatial trends, where it is usually greater at higher elevations, during summer, and to the north. Seasonal variability occurs due to summer monsoon storms bringing moisture from the Gulf of Mexico and Gulf of California and winter frontal systems bringing moisture from the Pacific Ocean by prevailing winds. Espa\u00f1ola, which is about 150 m (500 ft) lower in elevation than Dixon, receives about 0.3 m (11.4 in.) of precipitation on average annually, with summer monsoon rains accounting for about 55% of annual precipitation. Because Dixon is slightly higher in elevation, precipitation amounts may be slightly larger. Embudo Creek is a perennial stream that drains water from the Picuris Mountains to the northeast via Picuris Canyon and from the Sangre de Cristo Mountains to the southeast via the Rio Pueblo and the Rio Santa Barbara. Figure 4.4 shows a hydrograph for Embudo Creek at Dixon (USGS stream gage 08279000), illustrating natural flow fluctuations between 2010 and 2024. Flow rates in Embudo Creek usually increase to over 300 cfs during spring runoff (March through May) and monsoon season. However, in several instances, flow rates during these times have been 1 cfs or less, which correlates to years of low snowfall and monsoon precipitation. 103 C H A P T E R 4 : A S S E S S M E N T O F G R O U N D W A T E R R E S O U R C E S F O R D I X O N , N E W M E X I C O X Qa Ttcg Ttcg Ttd 1,900 1,800 1,700 1,600 1,500 1,900 1,800 1,700 1,600 1,500 1:40,000 5x vertical exaggeration 1,000 0 2,000 meters West East elevation meters elevation meters Embudo fault zone RA-064 RA-002 RA-072 RA-046 RA-048 RA-060 RA-056 RA-070 Geologic Units Ttd Dixon Member of Tesuque Formation X Hondo and Vadito groups, undivided Qa Alluvium Ttcg Gravelly Chama-El Rito Mbr of Tesuque Formation Potentiometric surface (~water table) Well Geologic contact location accurate Fault\u2014identity and existence certain location approximate Figure 4.3.

Most wells are completed 15.2 to 45.7 m (50\u2013150 ft) deep in sand, gravel, and sometimes clay, with many completed 45.7 to 91.4 m (150\u2013300 ft) and rarely over 100 m (328 ft). Examination of well logs suggests a maximum depth of the shallow alluvial aquifer of around 30 m (100 ft). All of the wells around Dixon are permitted for domestic use. Wells with total depths less than 10 m (33 ft) below the surface are completed in the shallow alluvial aquifer, but deeper wells are screened in the Chama-El Rito Member or a combination of the shallow aquifer and the Chama-El Rito Member. DATA ASSESSMENT Existing Data Figure 4.1 shows registered wells that include depth- to-water measurements in the well records (NMOSE, 2024). Although existing water chemistry data for groundwater are scarce, some data for mutual domestic wells in the study area (Table 4.2), including the Apodaca MDWCA, were located, and we sampled those during this study (well RA-048). The data source was Drinking Water Watch (New Mexico Environment Department, 2024). New Data As part of this study, 31 wells in the Dixon area were inventoried. This entailed documenting the well location along with measuring the static depth to water. Twenty-one of these wells (Fig. 4.5) plus two springs (RA-1002 and RA-1003) were sampled for water quality. Criteria for sample site selection included maximized well coverage over the study area, accessibility, the ability of the well to be sampled, and the goal to sample wells that are completed in both shallow and deep aquifer systems. All samples were analyzed for general chemistry (major cations and anions), trace metals, the presence of bacteria, and the stable oxygen and hydrogen isotopes of water. In addition, we tested five of these samples for carbon-14 and tritium, which provides information about how long the water has been in the subsurface. RESULTS Water Levels Figure 4.6 shows depth-to-water measurements for registered wells, which range from 0.3 to 223 m (1\u2013732 ft). Total well depth measurements for these wells range from 2.4 to 400 m (8\u20131,312 ft) below the surface. Most wells are located within the valley bottom and have depth-to-water measurements of less than 10 m (33 ft) and well depths of less than 40 m (131 ft). These wells are likely completed in the shallow alluvial aquifer. Wells in the valley bottom that are deeper than this tap the deep aquifer system. Some wells located at slightly higher elevations to the south exhibit depth-to-water values between 10 and 20 m (33 and 66 ft) and well depths ranging from 20 to 80 m (66\u2013262 ft), with a few wells with total depths"

In general, water quality in the Dixon area is quite good, with TDS concentrations for all but two wells (RA- 055 and RA-064) ranging from 258 to 434 mg/L (Fig. 4.10). For shallow aquifer system waters, TDS concentrations range from 117 to 211 mg/L\u2014well below the secondary MCL of 500 mg/L. Wells RA-055 and RA-064 exhibit TDS concentrations of 756 mg/L and 9,220 mg/L, respectively. While water quality is generally good, some constituents were found to be above both the primary and secondary MCLs. Groundwater sample results for coliform and several chemical constituents, including arsenic and fluoride, are depicted in Table 4.5. We tested all groundwater samples for the presence or absence of total coliform and E. coli. Only one shallow aquifer system well (RA-057) showed the presence of total coliform. Figure 4.11 shows arsenic concentrations for water samples; all but one deep well produce water that exceeds the primary MCL. Well RA-064 produces water with an arsenic concentration of 0.878 mg/L, which is over 80 times the MCL. The next-highest arsenic concentration was 0.0511 mg/L, observed for water produced by RA-069.

Only three deep aquifer system wells produce water exceeding the primary MCL of 4 mg/L, and almost all other deep aquifer system wells produce water exceeding the secondary MCL of 2 mg/L. The two wells farthest upstream (RA- 059 and RA-066) produce the only shallow aquifer system waters that exceed the secondary MCL of 2 mg/L. The spring RA-1003 discharges water that exceeds the primary MCLs for both arsenic and fluoride. A small number of wells (deep and shallow aquifer systems) produce water exceeding the secondary MCLs for iron and manganese. Well RA-064, located about 1 km (0.6 mi) downstream from Dixon, produces very poor-quality water, with a TDS concentration of almost 10,000 mg/L and an extremely high arsenic concentration; it also exceeds MCLs for fluoride, uranium, chloride, iron, and manganese. Table 4.5 also shows that several deep wells produce water with pH values above 8.5, which is discussed in more detail below.

For all but one deep aquifer system water (RA-071), the dominant cation is Na+; most deep aquifer system waters exhibit HCO3 - as the dominant anion. Three deep aquifer system waters (RA-055, RA-069, and RA-056) show an increase in relative SO4 2- concentrations. Water from the deep aquifer system well RA-064, which exhibits the highest TDS concentration, shows a very different anion composition, with Cl- being the dominant anion. Stoichiometric analysis, which accounts for the proportions in which elements or compounds react with one another, confirms that almost all water samples showed some degree of cation exchange. Cation exchange is a water/mineral interaction where Na+ ions that are adsorbed to clay minerals exchange with Ca2+ and Mg2+ ions that are dissolved in the groundwater. Because Ca2+ and Mg2+ have twice the charge of Na+, for every one molecule of Ca2+ or Mg2+ that adsorbs to a mineral surface, two molecules of Na+ are released into solution in the groundwater. This process can explain the overall trend observed for cations, which is a roughly linear arrangement from water that is Ca2+ dominant to Na+ dominant.

The Rocky Mountains meteoric water line has a deuterium excess (y-intercept) of 14.4. Local meteoric water lines with deuterium excesses greater than that of the global meteoric water line are usually derived in mountainous areas where there is enough local moisture to evaporate and contribute to some of the local precipitation. Evaporation of such local moisture tends to be enriched in deuterium, hence the higher deuterium excess value of the Rocky Mountains meteoric water line. Deep waters sampled above the valley bottom to the south of Embudo Creek have a different origin, which probably reflects a high-altitude aquifer that was possibly recharged during a colder climate (hence the lighter isotopic values compared to the shallow aquifer data). Mixing between these older waters in the deep aquifer system and water in the shallow alluvial aquifer results in observed isotopic compositions for water samples from wells RA-069, RA-071, and RA-052. Groundwater Ages Table 4.6 shows results for 3H, \u03b413CDIC, and carbon-14 analyses in the Dixon region. Water produced by well RA-066 is very young according to both 3H and carbon-14, which indicates it is about 20 years old. The other shallow aquifer system water (from RA-060) contains less 3H (3.35 TU) and has an older corrected carbon-14 age of 426 YBP, indicating that this water has traveled along a longer flow path and/or has mixed with older, 3H-free water along the way. The small negative 3H (essentially zero) values for deep aquifer wells RA-069 and RA-051\u2014both of which have high pH and are very rich in Na+\u2014are consistent with the old corrected carbon-14 ages of 27,409 and 35,535 YBP, respectively. Deep aquifer system water from RA-071, located at the far downstream end of the study area just before the confluence with the Rio Grande, has a 3H concentration of 2.76 TU and a corrected carbon-14 age of 160 YBP. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS For the following sections, refer to Figure 4.15, which is a hydrogeologic conceptual model based on the information and analyses discussed above. Characterization of the Shallow Alluvial Aquifer General Description The shallow alluvial aquifer supplies groundwater for residents and communities along Embudo Creek, including Dixon. The aquifer is composed of Quaternary alluvium, including sand, silty-clayey sand, gravelly sand, and sandy gravel. Based on the reported pumping yields, which range from 20 to 60 gpm, hydraulic conductivities are quite high, meaning that water can easily flow through pores in the aquifer. The primary limitation of this aquifer is its physical size. Its spatial extent is limited to the valley bottom (Fig. 4.9), which is about 0.8 km (0.5 mi) wide in most areas. The saturated thickness is greatest\u2014around 10 to 20 m (33\u201366 ft)\u2014along the longitudinal axis of the streambed (Fig. 4.8). As seen in the geologic cross section (Fig. 4.3), many wells continue through the alluvium and are completed in Santa Fe Group rocks and sediments, which tend to produce water of lower quality, as discussed below. Geochemical Description Groundwater produced from shallow aquifer system wells is high quality, with TDS concentrations below 500 mg/L. Except for well RA-059, all shallow aquifer system wells are Ca2+-HCO3 - water type (Fig. 4.13), resulting from the dissolution of calcium carbonate (CaCO3). Some variability observed for the cation composition is due to cation exchange and a small amount of mixing with other water sources. Table 4.6.

Hydrogeologic conceptual model for the Dixon area. The shallow alluvial aquifer is primarily recharged by rain and snow in the Sangre de Cristo Mountains, water from Embudo Creek, and acequias. Wells tapping the deep aquifer system are completed in Santa Fe Group rocks (Dixon and Chama-El Rito Members of the Tesuque Formation). The deep aquifer system likely sits on top of the Proterozoic crystalline rocks. Deep aquifer system water appears to increase in TDS concentrations with increasing depth. Deep groundwater flows to the west toward the Rio Grande. The Embudo fault zone forces these deep aquifer system waters to upwell into the shallow system on the other side of the fault zone. Groundwater in the deep aquifer system is generally low in TDS concentrations, high in relative sodium concentrations, and high in pH value (>8.5), which is likely due to dissolution of sodium-rich feldspars that make up much of the gravel and sand grains in the strata. 119 C H A P T E R 4 : A S S E S S M E N T O F G R O U N D W A T E R R E S O U R C E S F O R D I X O N , N E W M E X I C O 120 O P E N - F I L E R E P O R T 6 3 0 : E V A L U A T I O N O F G R O U N D W A T E R R E S O U R C E S F O R C O M M U N I T I E S I N R I O A R R I B A C O U N T Y Groundwater Recharge and Discharge Water from shallow aquifer system wells that was tested for tritium and carbon-14 contains tritium (Table 4.6), indicating that shallow aquifer system waters are a mixture of young groundwater that is less than 50 years old and older water that is more than 50 years old. Stable isotope data (Fig. 1.6) show that most shallow aquifer system waters are sourced from a high-elevation recharge area. These waters do not show any signs of evaporation, suggesting that Embudo Creek is likely a gaining stream much of the time. Therefore, much of the shallow groundwater is recent recharge, primarily from snowmelt and winter precipitation in the Sangre de Cristo Mountains to the southeast that is mixing with older shallow aquifer system waters that also originated in the Sangre de Cristo Mountains. However, some waters from the shallow aquifer system, such as well RA-066 and spring RA-1002, show evidence of evaporation (Fig. 4.14). The spring is located a short way up a small tributary to the south, and the well is located very close to the mouth of this tributary. These data suggest the tributary is a losing stream and recharges the shallow alluvial aquifer. Ultimately, water in the shallow alluvial aquifer discharges to Embudo Creek or the Rio Grande. Characterization of the Deep Aquifer Systems Groundwater produced by well RA-064 exhibits a TDS concentration of 9,220 mg/L, which is an order of magnitude higher than that exhibited by all other water samples (Fig. 4.13). This well is located west of the Embudo fault zone and is completed in Proterozoic rocks that crop out in that area. This well produces water that exceeds primary and secondary MCLs for almost all contaminants listed in Table 4.5, notably arsenic, which is exceeded by 80 times (Fig. 4.11). This water is likely very old (tens of thousands of years) and resides in fractures in Precambrian rocks. These rocks obviously do not constitute a suitable aquifer and should be avoided. Interestingly, the data shown here give no evidence this water is mixing into the shallow aquifer system. Figure 4.16 shows the locations of five deep aquifer system wells and the spring RA-1003, all of which produce water with high pH values (>8.5) that exhibit relative Na+ concentrations upward of 95% of total cations (Fig. 4.13). These waters appear to be discharging from the Chama-El Rito Member of the Tesuque Formation and exhibit TDS concentrations ranging from 258 to 756 mg/L. There is evidence that water chemically similar to water from RA-055, with a TDS concentration of 756 mg/L, is mixing with waters from the shallow alluvial aquifer system (Fig. 4.13). While these waters have relatively low TDS concentrations, they all exceed the primary MCL for arsenic (Fig. 4.11). Luckily, this mixing has not impacted the water quality of shallow aquifer system waters. Water with similar chemistry was observed for deep aquifer system wells in the Abiquiu Valley area, as described in Chapter 3. Similar water was also observed being produced from the Chama-El Rito Member of the Tesuque Formation in the San Luis Basin north of the Espa\u00f1ola Basin (Drakos et al., 2004). These high pH values are likely due to the dissolution of alkali feldspars (which are sodium- rich).

When fresh meteoric water with very low TDS concentration comes in contact with these feldspars, Na+ ions from the feldspar exchange with hydrogen ions (H+), resulting in pH increasing to values between 8.5 and 10. FUTURE WORK Based on the recharge processes and small size of the aquifer in this study region, it is critical to consider the long-term sustainability of water supplies. The primary recharge to this region is snowmelt and winter precipitation. As climate changes in the future with increased temperatures and reduced recharge to aquifers (via less snowpack), it is critical to consider multiple water supply options. Further community discussions regarding consolidated water supplies are considered an important next step for this region. Having numerous private domestic wells in an area where the primary aquifer (a shallow alluvial aquifer) is thin and not extensive may cause wells to impact each other through pumping. By potentially consolidating groundwater supplies to a few productive wells with good water quality, community supply for the long term may be accomplished.

As infiltration crosses the water table, dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) is isolated from modern carbon-14 inputs from the atmosphere and soil zone reservoirs. The carbon-14 decays with time as the water travels along a flow path in the aquifer system. As a result, the amount of carbon-14 measured in the groundwater along a flow path gives an age, or the approximate time that has passed since the water recharged the aquifer system. In general, lower PMC indicates older groundwater. However, to properly quantify groundwater age, correcting the measured carbon-14 activity is usually necessary to account for hydrogeologic processes such as carbonate dissolution, isotopic exchange, and mixing of older and younger waters. In general, these processes result in apparent ages that are older than the actual age of the water. The stable carbon isotopic composition for DIC in groundwater (\u03b413CDIC) is not only useful for correcting the carbon-14 age for the dissolution of calcium carbonate (CaCO3); it also provides important information about the type of vegetation in the recharge area. \u03b413CDIC is primarily a function of the carbon isotopic composition of the soil carbon dioxide in the recharge area and the carbon isotopic composition of the carbonate rock that has been dissolved (Clark and Fritz, 1997). The \u03b413C of soil carbon dioxide is very similar to that of the local vegetation, which is a function of the metabolic pathway by which carbon dioxide is converted to carbohydrates during photosynthesis. The Calvin cycle (C3\u2013\u03b413C ranges from -30\u2030 to -24\u2030) and the Hatch-Slack cycle (C4\u2013\u03b413C ranges from -6\u2030 to -10\u2030) are the two principal photosynthetic cycles that account for about 90% of plants globally (Clark and Fritz, 1997). C3 plants account for 85% of plant species, including conifers, which are common in high elevations in New Mexico where most recharge occurs. \u03b413CDIC-BASED CARBON-14 AGE CORRECTION The dissolution of carbon-dead (no detectable carbon-14) carbonate minerals, including calcite (CaCO3), ultimately dilutes carbon-14 concentrations in groundwater, resulting in older apparent ages. Correction for this process requires an estimate of the dilution factor, q, in the following equation: \ud835\udc61\ud835\udc61= \u22128267 \u2219\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc59( \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc61 14\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36 \ud835\udc5e\ud835\udc5e\u2219\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5c 14\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36)\u2061 where t = time in years and a14C = carbon-14 activity in PMC.

Corrections to apparent carbon-14 age dates were done only for samples collected from the Chama and Dixon study areas. CHAMA Refer to Table 2.5 in this report. Due to the very young age estimate (high PMC) and the low TDS concentration, we assumed the uncorrected carbon-14 age date for RA-029 was not in need of correction and that the \u03b413CDIC value was representative of the \u03b413CDIC value for recent recharge 128 O P E N - F I L E R E P O R T 6 3 0 : E V A L U A T I O N O F G R O U N D W A T E R R E S O U R C E S F O R C O M M U N I T I E S I N R I O A R R I B A C O U N T Y in the recharge area, with no dissolution of calcium carbonate or calcite. Therefore, a similar \u03b413C value was assumed to be \u03b413Csoil, and \u03b413Ccarb was assumed to be 0\u2030.
