The text presents conflicting statements about whether the study produced a depth‐to‐groundwater map, a water‐table (groundwater‐level) elevation map, or no hydrological map at all. On one hand, it describes methods (subtracting potentiometric surface elevations from land‐surface elevations) that imply a depth‐to‐groundwater or groundwater‐level contour map was created. On the other hand, it notes that the text itself does not definitively confirm what type of map was produced and that the study may instead have focused on a 3D geophysical model of rift‐fill thickness and fault‐zone properties. Overall, the document provides no conclusive statement on a final hydrological map product, emphasizing instead the study’s attention to geological formations and fault‐zone characteristics in the Albuquerque Basin.
