This text discusses whether the referenced study explicitly delineates a two-dimensional (2D) extent of an aquifer. Some statements assert that the report does define the aquifer’s areal boundaries, citing geologic maps, cross-sections, hydraulic contours, and fault zones as evidence. Others maintain that while the study includes maps (e.g., geologic and water table contour maps) and mentions key bounding geological features, it does not explicitly focus on mapping the aquifer’s 2D extent—highlighting instead issues such as groundwater flow, salinity differences, dune morphology, and areas of possible hydraulic uncertainty. Overall, the text points to multiple lines of evidence—geologic mapping, fault zone references, and water level contouring—suggesting partial 2D representation of the aquifer, though providing an explicit and comprehensive 2D boundary may not have been the study’s primary objective.
