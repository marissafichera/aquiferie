Quantitative analyses of groundwater chemistry data show that groundwater in both subbasins has similar chemi\u00ad cal characteristics. A systematic east to west groundwater evolution in water chemistry was not observed despite evidenced subbasin connectivity. The absence of this pattern suggests that groundwater mixing is regionally prevalent, sediment reactivity is low and variable, and (or) recharge conditions are comparable in both subbasins. Groundwater chemistry was generally independent of aquifer type, 1U.S. Geological Survey 2Earth and Environmental Science Department, New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology, Socorro, New Mexico 3New Mexico Bureau of Geology and Mineral Resources, New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology, Socorro, New Mexico suggesting that the aquifers are hydrologically well connected. Corrected carbon-14 groundwater age estimates in the basin ranged from 232 to 13,916 years before present with a median of 5,409 years. A wide range of groundwater ages is therefore present in the basin, with waters commonly being thousands of years old, thereby supporting generally slow regional groundwater movement. A component of relatively young groundwater, for which estimated ages could not be accurately computed, is also present in the basin, and it may commonly mix with older waters. The spatial distribution of categorical and quantitative groundwater ages indicates that most recharge likely occurs in the highlands through mountain-block recharge and as focused recharge within arroyos, although evi\u00ad dence of modern (1953 and after) groundwater was minimal at sampled sites. Median annual gradients (groundwater elevation change over time) indicate that most groundwater elevations in the lowlands changed little (\u22120.2 to 0.2 foot per year) from 1975 through 2019. Groundwater elevations in the highlands varied more annually, which is likely due to recharge from precipitation events. These more variable groundwater eleva\u00ad tions in the highlands compared with the lowlands, along with groundwater ages, provide further evidence that most groundwater recharge takes place in the highlands, with minimal recharge in the lowlands. Median groundwater eleva\u00ad tion change for all sites was \u22120.05 foot per year. Temporal consistency of lowland groundwater elevations suggests that regional groundwater dynamics have been more or less stable through time under current climate and develop\u00ad ment conditions, although median annual gradients indicate that groundwater elevations may have slightly declined on average between 1975 and 2019. Introduction The San Agustin Basin is composed of intermontane sediment filled subbasins in west-central New Mexico and hosts a relatively undeveloped basin-fill and alluvium aquifer system (fig. 1). This rural region is mainly utilized for ranching and recreation, with some irrigated agriculture (Homer and others, 2020). Interest in developing local ground\u00ad water resources has increased in recent years. This interest 2 Hydrogeology and Groundwater Quality in the San Agustin Basin, New Mexico, 1975\u20132019 has been met with concern about potential adverse impacts of substantial development and with protest by local, State, Tribal, and Federal entities (Turner, 2019). The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) in cooperation with the Bureau of Land Management performed this study to improve the understanding of present-day (1975\u20132019) hydrogeology and groundwater quality of the basin to support sustainable groundwater resource management. This work included the compilation and collection of groundwater chemistry (major ions, trace elements, stable isotopes, and groundwater age tracers) and groundwater elevation data along with the interpretation of these data in the context of groundwater flow and quality. Groundwater elevation analyses included construction of a groundwater elevation map and assessment of the time dependence of groundwater elevations to estimate the dynamics of groundwater flow. The general character and spatial variation of groundwater chemistry were also evaluated to further understand the quality and movement of basin groundwater. Purpose and Scope The purpose of this report is to present interpretative results associated with groundwater elevation and groundwater chemistry analyses for the basin. This report serves to enhance the understanding of the region\u2019s groundwater resources and allow interested parties to better evaluate the potential impacts of future groundwater development scenarios. The study area and subbasin boundaries considered in this report were delin\u00ad eated on the basis of surface water hydrologic units derived by the USGS (1999) because groundwater boundaries were not well known. The analyses included in this report considered groundwater chemistry data collected within the last decade (2010\u201319) and groundwater elevation data collected from 1975 through 2019; the longer time span for groundwa\u00ad ter elevation data was used in order to address prevalent data gaps in data collected over the last decade. Data collection efforts were subject to land access, groundwater well avail\u00ad ability, and funding and do not comprehensively address all data gaps. Only data collected and compiled by the USGS and the New Mexico Bureau of Geology and Mineral Resources (NMBGMR) were considered in the analyses in order to utilize data that were collected while following similar proce\u00ad dures. Overall, this report aims to provide a broad overview of present-day (1975\u20132019) hydrogeology and groundwater quality for the basin to support sustainable groundwater resource management. Description of Study Area Physiography and Geologic History San Agustin Basin covers approximately 1,990 square miles (mi2) within the northern portion of the Mogollon-Datil volcanic field in west-central New Mexico (fig. 1). The Mogollon-Datil volcanic field is a transitional zone between the Colorado Plateau in northwest New Mexico and the Basin and Range Province in southwest New Mexico (Basabilvazo, 1997). This volcanic province contains abundant mid-Tertiary (43\u201321 million years ago) volcanic rocks and features such as dikes, vents, and pyroclastic flows (Myers and others, 1994; Chapin and others, 2004).

Description of Study Area Physiography and Geologic History San Agustin Basin covers approximately 1,990 square miles (mi2) within the northern portion of the Mogollon-Datil volcanic field in west-central New Mexico (fig. 1). The Mogollon-Datil volcanic field is a transitional zone between the Colorado Plateau in northwest New Mexico and the Basin and Range Province in southwest New Mexico (Basabilvazo, 1997). This volcanic province contains abundant mid-Tertiary (43\u201321 million years ago) volcanic rocks and features such as dikes, vents, and pyroclastic flows (Myers and others, 1994; Chapin and others, 2004). The basin is a graben that formed because of Neogene extension along the Rio Grande rift that traverses central New Mexico (Phillips and others, 1992; Myers and others, 1994) (fig. 1). The south and west extents of the basin are bound by the Continental Divide in the Luera and Tularosa Mountains. The northern basin boundary is formed by the Mangas, Datil, and Gallinas Mountains, whereas the Gallinas and San Mateo Mountains constrain the basin in the east. The basin is split into the east and west San Agustin subbasins by the McClure Hills (Rinehart and others, 2017). The west San Agustin subbasin (west subbasin) is the larger of the two subbasins, spanning 1,180 mi2 or 59 percent of the basin. The east San Agustin subbasin (east subbasin) covers an area of 810 mi2 or 41 percent of the basin. Faults further break the east subbasin into the C-N, White Lake, and North grabens (Rinehart and others, 2017). Elevation ranges from 6,892 to 9,538 feet (ft) in the east subbasin and is between 6,772 and 10,228 ft in the west subbasin, thereby yielding 3,456 ft of topographic relief across the basin. Climate and Vegetation Local climate is semiarid with temperatures, precipitation, and vegetation being largely dependent on elevation (Phillips and others, 1992; Myers and others, 1994). Temperature and precipitation weather station data collected in the lowlands of the east subbasin spanning from April 19, 1926, through December 31, 2019, are presented in figure 2. Lowland daily mean temperatures typically vary between 0 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit and have increased on average since the late 1970s, which is consistent with global temperature trends (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, 2014). The majority of precipitation is often in the form of summer monsoonal rain and annually averages a total amount between about 10 inches (in.) in the lowlands and 30 in. in the surrounding highlands, whereas a smaller proportion of the precipitation occurs as winter snowfall (Phillips and others, 1992; Myers and others, 1994; Rinehart and others, 2017). Daily lowland precipitation historically varies between 0 and 2.5 in., with notable periods of relative dryness in the 1930s and between about 1945 and 1975 and a relatively wet period in the 1990s (fig. 2). Vegetation consists of grasses in the lowlands, pinyon pine (Pinus spp.) and juniper (Juniperus spp.) forests in the foothills, and Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) forests at higher elevations (Potter, 1957; Phillips and others, 1992; Homer and others, 2020).

The most prominent nearby surface water features are Alamosa Creek in Monticello Canyon to the southeast, the Tularosa River near the Mangas and Tularosa Mountains to the northwest, and the Gila River with its east fork headwaters to the south of the basin in the northern East Fork Gila River watershed (fig. 1). Alamosa Creek drains towards the Rio Grande in central New Mexico, whereas the Tularosa River and Gila River flow through western New Mexico towards the Colorado River in Arizona; the Tularosa River joins the San Francisco River in western New Mexico before merging with the Gila River in eastern Arizona. Quaternary lacustrine and playa deposits can be found in both the east and west subbasins and are the rem\u00ad nants of Pleistocene paleolakes (fig. 3) (Phillips and others, 1992; Myers and others, 1994). Some researchers believe that these paleolakes were once connected to form a lake that was 34 miles long, 11 miles wide, and 165 ft deep (Myers and oth\u00ad ers, 1994; Weber, 1994). There is no evidence of any notable local tectonic activity that is younger than the extinct lake, and minimal standing water exists in the basin today (Myers and others, 1994). Groundwater The Quaternary basin-fill and alluvial sediments are the principal groundwater aquifers in the basin and store large amounts of accessible groundwater in each of the subbasins (fig. 3). These piedmont, lacustrine, playa, eolian, and alluvial sediments are a mixture of unconsolidated clay, silt, sand, and gravel (Qa, Qpl, Qp, Qoa, Qts, and Qtg in fig. 3). Myers and others (1994) estimated that a total of 53.5 million acre- feet (acre-ft) of freshwater is stored in these sediments, with 34.4 million acre-ft in the east subbasin and 19.1 million acre-ft in the west subbasin. An additional 9 million acre-ft of saline water is thought to be stored in the alluvial fill of the western portion of the west subbasin, where lacustrine paleolake deposits are prevalent (Myers and others, 1994). The Quaternary sediments vary in thickness but are as thick as 4,600 ft in some areas (Myers and others, 1994). The underlying Tertiary Datil Group, which includes the Spears Formation, is exposed in the highlands and stores lesser amounts of groundwater but is hydraulically conductive where fractured (fig. 3) (Rinehart and others, 2017). These volcanic units vary in composition and include silicic to intermediate volcanic rocks, basaltic to andesitic lava flows, felsic and mafic intrusives, ash-flow tuffs, and pyroclastic rocks. Recharge to these aquifers is believed to take place primarily in the highlands through precipitation directly falling onto outcrops and permeable soils and runoff infiltration into permeable material in the foothills (Myers and others, 1994). The playas in the lowlands (fig. 3) sometimes accumulate runoff, but this water is thought to evaporate rather than infiltrate because of the poor drainage of these sediments (Myers and others, 1994). Groundwater conditions in the aquifer system are generally unconfined, and the aquifers are thought to be hydrologically connected to one another (Basabilvazo, 1997). The small amount of published aquifer property data is presented in tables 1 and 2, which were compiled from Myers and others (1994), Basabilvazo (1997), and New Mexico Office of the State Engineer (2020). These data show that basin-fill and alluvium transmissivity estimates range from 1,949 to 70,600 square feet per day with specific capacities ranging from 5.7 to 90 gallons per minute per foot. The few specific yield and storage coefficients for the basin-fill and alluvium aquifer system average about 15 percent and 0.15, respectively, with the east subbasin having a slightly elevated mean specific yield value (18.4 percent) compared to the west subbasin (13.3 percent). No specific yield, storage coefficient, or transmissivity data are known to be available for the local Datil Group. The interbedded Spears Formation has much smaller transmissivity and specific capacity estimates than the basin fill and alluvium, with values for two wells of 1.6 and 12.24 square feet per day and 0.016 and 0.046 gallons per minute per foot, respectively. Depth to groundwater in the basin fill and alluvium typically ranges from about 3 to 320 ft below the ground surface (Basabilvazo, 1997). The most recently published groundwater elevation map of the area shows relatively steep hydraulic gradients in the foothills that lead to gently sloping lowland hydraulic gradients (Rinehart and others, 2017). The map depicts groundwater regionally flowing from east to west before discharging into the northern East Fork Gila River watershed, which is consistent with previous research\u00ad ers (Blodgett and Titus, 1973; Myers and others, 1994; Rinehart and others, 2017). The east and west subbasins are thought to be hydrologically connected via lowlands in the McClure Hills (Rinehart and others, 2017). Groundwater elevation contours also suggest that the northernmost portion of the North graben of the east subbasin may be structurally compartmentalized and disconnected from the rest of the basin (Rinehart and others, 2017). Recent work by the NMB\u00ad GMR indicates that there is a negligible hydrologic connec\u00ad tion between the basin and Monticello Canyon (Rinehart and others, 2017). The NMBGMR recently collected water quality data throughout the east subbasin and the eastern portion of the west subbasin; water quality data have not been collected throughout much of the western portion of the west subba\u00ad sin in the last 40 years (Rinehart and others, 2017; USGS, 2021). Generally, groundwater supplies are fresh with total dissolved solids (TDS) concentrations of less than 1,000 milligrams per liter (mg/L), except in portions of the west subbasin where brackish (1,000\u201310,000 mg/L) and saline (greater than 10,000 mg/L) water resides in and below playa deposits. 6 Hydrogeology and Groundwater Quality in the San Agustin Basin, New Mexico, 1975\u20132019 34\u00b020' 108\u00b020' 108\u00b0 107\u00b040' 34\u00b0 33\u00b040' Base from Esri 2018 and its licensors Geographic coordinate system North American Datum of 1983 12 60 60 0 5 10 MILES 0 5 10 KILOMETERS EXPLANATION Quaternary alluvium (Qa) Quaternary lacustrine and playa deposits (Qpl) Quaternary piedmont alluvial deposits (Qp, Qoa) Quaternary and Tertiary sedimentary units (QTs, QTg, Tus, Tfl, Tsf) Neogene silicic to intermediate volcanic rocks and basaltic to andesitic lava flows (Tmb, Tnr) Middle Tertiary volcaniclastic sedimentary units (Tvs) Tertiary rhyolites, dacites, andesites, basaltic andesites, pyroclastic rocks, ash-flow tuffs, and intrusive rocks (Tuau,"

Methods 7 The basin is sparsely populated, with water primarily being used for irrigation, livestock, domestic, and recreational purposes (Rinehart and others, 2017; Magnuson and others, 2019). Groundwater from the basin-fill and alluvium aquifer system is the primary water source for existing water users in the basin (Rinehart and others, 2017). In 2015, the most recent year for which water-use data are published, 278 acre-ft of groundwater were withdrawn for irrigation of 110 acres in the basin, largely in the northern portion of the east subbasin (Magnuson and others, 2019). Irrigation wells in the east subbasin have produced at rates of about 975 gallons per minute (Myers and others, 1994; Basabilvazo, 1997). Domestic and livestock wells in the area have produced at rates ranging from less than 1 to 20 gallons per minute (Basabilvazo, 1997). Methods The analyses presented in this report include evaluation of groundwater elevation and chemistry data to improve the understanding of present-day (1975\u20132019) groundwater flow patterns and quality.

Limiting the considered timeframe favors better understanding of recent conditions that are likely most pertinent to future resource management. These analyses do not consider all available data, and their results therefore do not comprehen\u00ad sively represent the historical hydrology in the basin. Lowland temperature and precipitation variations through time in the east subbasin (fig. 2) indicate that the period considered was subject to elevated daily mean air temperatures and total daily precipitation relative to historical values, thus making findings from this study most relevant to present-day conditions. All sites with data that were used in the groundwater elevation contouring and for the chemistry analyses are presented in figure 4 and listed in table 3. Groundwater eleva\u00ad tion data were used to create a groundwater elevation map to estimate groundwater flow patterns in the basin-fill and alluvium aquifer system. The annual variability of ground\u00ad water elevation data was also evaluated to gain a sense of the time dependence of groundwater flow patterns. Groundwater chemistry characteristics were investigated by using various plots, principal component analysis (PCA), and Wilcoxon tests to provide further insight into groundwater flow patterns and water quality variability. Emphasis was placed on comparing east and west subbasin groundwater chemistry to better understand geochemical differences between the subbasins. Most analyses were performed by using the R programming language, version 3.5.3 (R Core Team, 2019). Sources and Descriptions of Data Groundwater Elevation Depth to water measurements were collected by the USGS at five wells in March and April 2019. These data were acquired by using steel tapes while following standard USGS protocols for discrete water level measurements (Cunningham and Schalk, 2011).

Measured values were combined with historical depth to groundwater data from the USGS National Water Information System (NWIS; USGS, 2021). These data were converted to estimated groundwater elevation by using the digital elevation model of the USGS NWIS (app. 1; USGS, 2021); appendix 1 contains the compiled data. Measurements taken coincidentally with pumping at or near the site were omitted from all analyses (see \u201cWater-level status code description\u201d column of table 1.1 in app. 1). Data with unknown measurement dates were also omitted from all analyses. Median groundwater elevations for 124 wells that are likely completed in the basin-fill and alluvium aquifer system were computed for the time period of 1975\u20132019 to facilitate groundwater elevation contouring; the earliest measurement considered was taken on November 15, 1975, whereas the latest value was measured on April 10, 2019. The median values that were used to construct the groundwater elevation map are provided in table 4. Groundwater Chemistry Groundwater chemistry samples were collected and analyzed by the USGS at 14 sites in 2019, all of which were from the western portion of the west subbasin (fig. 4 and table 3). These data were combined with recent (July 2010 through February 2019) chemistry results provided by the NMBGMR for 30 additional locations dispersed throughout the basin (fig. 4) (Rinehart and others, 2017). Data at the 44 locations were used for all interpretative chemistry analyses unless noted otherwise and are provided for reference in appendix 2. The earliest sample date considered was July 23, 2010, whereas the most recent sample was collected on April 10, 2019. Well depths were available for 27 of the 44 sites (61 percent) and ranged from 65 to 1,000 ft (median = 305 ft). NMBGMR samples were collected and analyzed according to methods in Timmons and others (2013), whereas USGS samples were collected in accordance with the procedures described in the USGS \u201cNational Field Manual for the Collection of Water-Quality Data\u201d (USGS, variously dated)\u2014the NMBGMR and USGS protocols are similar, thereby providing high confidence in data quality from both agencies. All samples had an absolute ion mass balance within 10 percent. A compilation of historical USGS NWIS data dating back to December 20, 1933, is provided in appendix 3, although only recent (2010\u201319) chemistry data were inter\u00ad preted in this report. Major ion, trace element, alkalinity, stable isotope, tritium, and carbon-14 data were analyzed for sites sampled by the USGS. Existing windmills or submersible pumps were used to purge borehole water and obtain water quality samples. Carbon-14 was not analyzed for sites with wind\u00ad mills because of the possible introduction of air into the water during pumping. Additionally, trace element chem\u00ad istry (except for iron and manganese) was not analyzed for windmill sites to avoid elevated, and difficult to quantify, data uncertainties associated with increased exposure of groundwater to the atmosphere and larger pressures imposed on groundwater during pumping. In adherence with USGS sampling protocols, sampling commenced after three borehole volumes were purged and monitored field parameter measure\u00ad ments stabilized; these parameters included dissolved oxygen, specific conductance, pH, and water temperature (USGS, variously dated). Parameter stability was solely used at about half of the sites, as borehole volumes could not be calculated because of incomplete well completion information such as well depth, flow rate, casing diameter at depth, or water level. Upon reaching field parameter stability, groundwater samples were collected. Samples used for major ion, trace element, alkalinity, and carbon-14 analyses were filtered (0.45 micrometers) at the time of collection. Ultrapure nitric acid was added to samples collected for major ion and trace element analyses until their pH was less than 2 for preserva\u00ad tion purposes. Alkalinity analysis was performed in the field by using the incremental equivalence method (USGS, vari\u00ad ously dated). Unfiltered samples were collected for tritium and stable isotope analyses.

Major ions calcium, magnesium, potassium, silica, and sodium, along with trace elements iron and man\u00ad ganese, were analyzed by inductively coupled plasma opti\u00ad cal emission spectrophotometry (ICP-OES) (Fishman and Friedman, 1989). Ion-exchange chromatography was used to analyze for bromide, fluoride, chloride, and sulfate (Fishman, 1993). Inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) was used for the following trace elements: silver, aluminum, arsenic, boron, barium, beryllium, cadmium, cobalt, chromium, copper, lithium, manganese, molybdenum, nickel, lead, antimony, selenium, strontium, thallium, uranium, vanadium, and zinc (Garbarino, 1999; Garbarino and others, 2005). Manganese concentrations acquired from ICP-MS were favored over those obtained from ICP-OES when results from both methods were available.

Stable isotope ratios are reported in per mil relative to Vienna Standard Mean Ocean Water. Groundwater age tracers were analyzed at two laboratories. Tritium concentrations were analyzed at the University of Miami\u2019s Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science Tritium Laboratory in Miami, Florida, by using low-level gas proportional counters (Thatcher and others, 1977) and are reported in picocuries per liter. Carbon-14 analyses were completed by the National Ocean Sciences Accelerator Mass Spectrometry facility at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Woods Hole, Massachusetts. Carbon-14 values are reported as absolute percent modern. One field blank sample was collected at site 11 during sampling to assess potential bias introduced by the collection, processing, and transportation of the environmental samples. The field blank sample was obtained by running certified inorganic blank water through the tubing and fittings that were used for environmental water sampling. Ideally, the field blank sample analyses would yield negligible concentrations of all constituents and thereby indicate minimal introduced bias. The field blank results indicate very low potential for contamination for nearly all constituents considered in this study (table 4.1 in app. 4), although metals from the windmill"

Stable isotope ratios are reported in per mil relative to Vienna Standard Mean Ocean Water. Groundwater age tracers were analyzed at two laboratories. Tritium concentrations were analyzed at the University of Miami\u2019s Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science Tritium Laboratory in Miami, Florida, by using low-level gas proportional counters (Thatcher and others, 1977) and are reported in picocuries per liter. Carbon-14 analyses were completed by the National Ocean Sciences Accelerator Mass Spectrometry facility at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Woods Hole, Massachusetts. Carbon-14 values are reported as absolute percent modern. One field blank sample was collected at site 11 during sampling to assess potential bias introduced by the collection, processing, and transportation of the environmental samples. The field blank sample was obtained by running certified inorganic blank water through the tubing and fittings that were used for environmental water sampling. Ideally, the field blank sample analyses would yield negligible concentrations of all constituents and thereby indicate minimal introduced bias. The field blank results indicate very low potential for contamination for nearly all constituents considered in this study (table 4.1 in app. 4), although metals from the windmill and well casing themselves were not accounted for because field blanks could not include this equipment. Vanadium and cobalt were the only two constituents with concentrations that exceeded the laboratory detection limit, thereby indicating potential bias for these two constituents. However, all envi\u00ad ronmental results for cobalt and vanadium were greater than 10 times the field blank values or were not detected in the sample. This contrast indicates that potential bias introduced from the sampling procedures is likely small relative to mea\u00ad sured concentrations and was therefore considered negligible in all interpretations. A replicate sample was also collected at site 11 at the time of sampling to evaluate the variability and uncertainty of environmental results. Replicate results are provided in appendix 4 (table 4.2). Absolute relative percent differences (ARPDs) were computed between uncensored replicate and environmental values as follows for each constituent: ( ) 100 / 2 Replicate value Environmental value ARPD Replicate value Environmental value \u2212 = + (1) Resulting ARPDs were all less than 10 percent except for lead (25.8 percent) (table 4.2 in app. 4). The lead concentrations themselves were very small (environmental = 0.0673 \u00b5g/L, replicate = 0.0519 \u00b5g/L, difference = \u22120.0154 \u00b5g/L), which indicates that the elevated ARPD was the result of high analy\u00ad sis precision (being able to detect very small concentrations) rather than increased data uncertainty. Censored (values less than the detection limit and [or] reporting level) environmental and replicate results all agreed with one another as well. Tritium was the only censored constituent that differed in the replicate analysis (environmental = 0.29 picocuries per liter [pCi/L]; replicate = R \u22120.04, where R denotes that the value was less than the tritium reporting level). The uncensored tritium environmental concentration was 0.29 pCi/L, which was slightly less than the tritium detection level of 0.30 pCi/L, although it exceeded the tritium reporting level. Provided the marginal difference between the tritium detection level and the environmental value, the replicate results were essentially equivalent. Overall, the replicate analysis suggests that the environmental results were highly reproducible. The NMBGMR used different laboratories for analyses of major ions, trace elements, stable isotopes, and carbon-14, which, when combined with slightly different sampling strategies, created reporting and accuracy differences within the overall analyzed dataset. The technologies utilized at those laboratories to analyze constituents were comparable or identical to those used to analyze the USGS data in this study (Timmons and others, 2013; USGS, variously dated). The NMBGMR internally inspects the quality of reported results by analyzing blanks, standards, and replicate samples and checking ion balances as part of their standard protocol (Timmons and others, 2013), although the quality assur\u00ad ance data were not reported with their environmental data. Samples at sites 2 and 7 were collected by both agencies about 4 months apart and showed minor differences. Of the 23 comeasured constituents, 18 yielded ARPDs of less than 10 percent despite the time gap between sample collection (Rinehart and others, 2017; USGS, 2021). Constituents that exceeded this threshold include field temperature (site 7 = 27.4 percent), bromide (site 2 = 29.8 percent, site 7 = 19.4 percent), fluoride (site 7 = 14.4 percent), iron (site 2 = 151.2 percent, site 7 = 19.7 percent), and manganese (site 2 = 98.5 percent, site 7 = 136.6 percent). The most substantial differences were for manganese at both sites and iron at site 2. While it is possible that these differences are a result of sam\u00ad pling and analysis protocols, it is common to see appreciable fluctuations in these two constituents at longstanding steel- cased windmill-powered wells, depending on time of year and flow rate; given that these results were at least twice their ana\u00ad lytical detection level, the latter seems most likely. Generally, the collocated samples agreed well with one another, and the minor differences in sampling and analytical protocols between the NMBGMR and USGS are not thought to substan\u00ad tially and systematically bias the analyses performed herein. Analysis of Groundwater Elevation Data Interpolation of Groundwater Elevation To better understand groundwater flow patterns in the San Agustin Basin, a two-dimensional groundwater elevation contour map for the basin-fill and alluvium aquifer system was constructed by using the median groundwater elevations 20 Hydrogeology and Groundwater Quality in the San Agustin Basin, New Mexico, 1975\u20132019 from 1975 through 2019 presented in table 4. Interpolation between measurement locations was completed by using the kriging geostatistical method (see Fisher, 2013). This approach estimates values at unmeasured locations as a weighted average of measured values. The weights are derived from the spatial correlation of measurements, as indicated by an empirical semivariogram (Fisher, 2013). Kriging assumes stationarity, meaning that the mean value of the data being contoured and the empirical semivariogram are constant throughout the area of interest. A second-order polynomial trend function representative of regional groundwater eleva\u00ad tion trend was subtracted from the measured values during semivariogram modeling and kriging to favor stationarity. The removed spatial trend was formulated as follows: \u200b z\u200b(s)\u200b \u200b= \u200b\u03b2\u200b 0\u200b + \u200b\u03b2\u200b 1\u200b x\u200b(s)\u200b + \u200b\u03b2\u200b 2\u200b y\u200b(s)\u200b + \u200b \u200b\u03b2\u200b 3\u200b x \u200b(s)\u200b 2\u200b + \u200b\u03b2\u200b 4\u200b y \u200b(s)\u200b 2\u200b + \u200b\u03b2\u200b 5\u200b x\u200b(s)\u200by\u200b(s)\u200b \u200b\b (2) where z (s) is median groundwater elevation at point s, in feet above the North American Vertical Datum of 1988 (NAVD 88); \u03b20 is a deterministic unknown trend coefficient, in feet above NAVD 88; \u03b2i are deterministic unknown trend coefficients, in dimensionless units (i = 1"

Normally distributed residuals had a mean and median of 0.00 ft and \u22127.11 ft, respectively, thereby suggesting an acceptable level of spatial stationarity to permit application of kriging. The trend was calculated, removed, and added back to kriged residuals within the R functions that were used for semivariogram development and kriging, as appropriate (functions are listed below). This type of kriging with trend removal is known as universal kriging (Fisher, 2013). The final contoured area was restricted to the basin lowlands, as interpreted from satellite imagery and topographic maps, to avoid elevated universal kriging estimation errors introduced by abrupt groundwater elevation changes in the highlands. The empirical semivariogram is a graphical representation of how differences in measured values (in terms of semivari\u00ad ance) change as a function of distance between measurement locations (lag distance). A continuous semivariogram model was fit to the curvature of the empirical semivariogram to provide a data-driven method for kriging to estimate spatial correlation at all lag distances. A semivariogram model has four primary characteristics: (1) model type, (2) range, (3) sill, and (4) nugget. The model type defines the overall shape of the semivariogram model and will change depending on how rapidly measured values change as a function of lag distance. Semivariance in semivariograms typically levels off at a certain lag distance, beyond which there is minimal spatial correlation between measured and unmeasured locations. This distance is called the range, and the semivariance value at which the semivariogram levels off is called the sill. The nugget is the semivariance at a lag distance of zero, or the y-intercept of the semivariogram model, and is therefore typically related to measurement error. The empirical semivariogram in this study was calculated by using the \u201cvariogram\u201d function within the \u201cgstat\u201d R package, version 2.0\u20130 (Pebesma and Graeler, 2019). The maximum lag distance considered in the empirical semi\u00ad variogram was 15,000 meters (m), or about half the median distance between all observation pairs (29,940 m) and about one-fifth the maximum distance between observation locations (85,923 m). A bin width of 1,000 m was used in the empirical semivariogram calculation because it yielded the most readily identifiable semivariogram curvature (15 bins total). The \u201cfit. variogram\u201d function of the same \u201cgstat\u201d R package was then used to fit a continuous semivariogram model to the empirical semivariogram. The resulting semivariogram model was of spherical type, with a range of 5,791 m, sill of 3,228 square feet, and nugget of 0 square feet (fig. 5). The modeled theoreti\u00ad cal semivariogram well represents the general curvature of the empirical semivariogram, as evidenced by their Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.86. Kriging was then performed by using the \u201ckrige\u201d function within the previously mentioned \u201cgstat\u201d R package to estimate groundwater elevations on a uniform raster grid. Interpolation root-mean-square error (RMSE) at measured locations decreased as a function of raster grid cell size. A uniform grid cell size of 35 ft (10.668 m) was selected as a compromise between raster file size and RMSE. Measured values were very well represented by kriged raster estimates, with an RMSE of 0.1638 ft, Pearson correlation coefficient of 1.00, mean residual (measurements minus estimates) of 0.01 ft, and median residual of 0.00 ft. The final kriged contour map is dis\u00ad cussed and presented in the \u201cResults and Discussion\u201d section of this report. Leave-one-out cross validation (LOOCV) was performed to further evaluate the predictive capabilities of the kriging approach. LOOCV provides insight into predictive capability by removing one data point, kriging the remaining data, and computing kriged estimation error at the removed location. This process is repeated for all measurement locations. LOOCV was performed by using the \u201cRunCrossValidation\u201d function within the \u201cObsNetwork\u201d R package, version 1.0.1.9000 (Fisher, 2013). Mean LOOCV error (measurements minus LOOCV estimations) would ideally be zero and was \u22121.52 ft in the analysis (fig. 6A), indicating that the kriging approach had a high level of predictive ability with a small bias towards overestimating groundwater elevations. This notion is further emphasized by the very low Pearson cor\u00ad relation coefficient of 0.05 between LOOCV estimations and LOOCV errors, as well as the high Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.88 between measured groundwater elevations and LOOCV estimations (fig. 6B). Nineteen sites had more Methods 21 than 50 ft of LOOCV error and are labeled in figure 6B. All these sites are in the foothills of the basin (fig. 4), where groundwater elevations show greater variation over short dis\u00ad tances than elsewhere in the basin. Fifteen of these sites are in the northern foothills of the west subbasin, whereas four sites are dispersed throughout the foothills of the east subbasin. This pattern of LOOCV errors indicates a greater sensitivity to data density and elevated estimation uncertainty in these areas. Generally, estimation uncertainty increases with distance from measurement locations, which is further discussed in terms of kriging standard error within the \u201cResults and Discussion\u201d section of this report. Overall, the kriged solution performed well and is thought to reasonably estimate the groundwater elevations throughout the area of interest.

Temporal Analysis of Groundwater Elevation The median annual change in groundwater elevations over time (median annual gradient) was calculated for each site that had multiple measurements from 1975 through 2019 to provide insight into the dynamics of groundwater flow patterns. Unlike the groundwater elevation interpolation, sites throughout the entire basin and in any aquifer were included in the analysis. The median annual gradient for each site was calculated by using a forward difference derivative approximation, as follows: \u200bdz _ dt \u200b median \u200b \u200b= median\u200b[\u200b z\u200b(\u200bt\u200b 2\u200b)\u200b \u2212 z\u200b(\u200bt\u200b 1\u200b)\u200b _ \u200bt\u200b 2\u200b \u2212 \u200bt\u200b 1\u200b \u200b, \u2026 \u200b z\u200b(\u200bt\u200b n\u200b)\u200b \u2212 z\u200b(\u200bt\u200b n\u22121\u200b)\u200b ___________ \u200bt\u200b n\u200b \u2212 \u200bt\u200b n\u22121\u200b \u200b ]\u200b365\u200b\b (3) where \u200b\u200bdz _ dt \u200b median \u200b is the median annual gradient for a site, in feet per year; z (ti) is groundwater elevation at time i, in feet above NAVD 88 (i = 1 to n); n is the number of groundwater elevation measurements at a site; and ti is the date of the ith groundwater elevation measurement, in days (i = 1 to n).

For example, site 138 had 5 measurements that were collected between November 15, 1978, and January 30, 1990, whereas site 113 had 20 measurements spanning February 5, 2001, through March 3, 2017. The computed median annual gradients for these sites were calculated over different time intervals and do not provide a comprehensive estimate of groundwater elevation change throughout the full period of interest (1975\u20132019). Seasonality of groundwater elevations through any given year was also not considered. Insufficient repeat measurements restricted the ability to do a more com\u00ad plete analysis, and these potential implicit biases should be considered when interpreting the results. On average, each site had 10 measurements that spanned about 26 years (median = 34 years). Median annual gradients are spatially presented and discussed in the \u201cResults and Discussion\u201d section of this report and are tabulated in table 4 for sites used in the groundwater elevation contouring. Analysis of Groundwater Chemistry Data All interpretative chemistry analyses were performed on the 2010\u201319 groundwater chemistry data, although data were omitted as needed to meet the conditions required for particu\u00ad lar analyses. Major ion chemistry (sodium, calcium, magne\u00ad sium, potassium, carbonate, bicarbonate, sulfate, and chloride) was plotted on a Piper diagram by using The Geochemist\u2019s Workbench, version 12 (Bethke and others, 2019). Sites 18 and 42 were excluded from the diagram because of a lack of data for one or more of the major ions. Data were labeled according to the aquifer and subbasin of the corresponding sample location. Major ion, trace element, and TDS concentra\u00ad tions, as well as pH, were compared to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) water quality standards for drinking water. This comparison included maximum contaminant levels (MCLs) and secondary maximum contaminant levels (SMCLs), which are presented in table 5 (EPA, 2020a, b). Wilcoxon Tests Probability values (p-values) from two-sided Wilcoxon rank sum tests (Wilcoxon tests) were computed to compare the groundwater chemistry of the east and west subbasins. The Wilcoxon test is a nonparametric method to test if the distribu\u00ad tions, or percentiles, of two groups of data are similar or not (Helsel and others, 2020).

Wilcoxon tests were performed on uncensored data by using the \u201cwilcox.test\u201d function of the \u201cstats\u201d base R package, version 3.5.3 (R Core Team, 2019), whereas censored data were processed using the \u201ccendiff\u201d function of the \u201cNADA\u201d package, version 1.6\u20131.1 (Lee, 2020). The null and alternative hypotheses evaluated by the Wilcoxon tests were as follows: Null hypothesis = data values are similar in both subbasins; Alternative hypothesis = data values differ between subbasins. The two-sided approach used for the Wilcoxon test considers evidence in both directions (values in one dataset are typically larger or smaller than values in the other) when evaluat\u00ad ing the likelihood of the null hypothesis being false (Helsel and others, 2020). The p-value computed by the Wilcoxon test rep\u00ad resents a measure of the likelihood of the null hypothesis being true (Helsel and others, 2020). Smaller p-values indicate that it is less likely that the null hypothesis is true and thereby encour\u00ad age adoption of the alternative hypothesis. A p-value threshold of 0.05 is commonly used to reject the null hypothesis and repre\u00ad sents a 5 percent chance of incorrectly rejecting the null hypoth\u00ad esis (Helsel and others, 2020). This threshold was adopted for all Wilcoxon-test interpretations in this report to avoid a higher likelihood of incorrectly failing to reject the null hypothesis by selecting a stricter criterion (for example, p-value of 0.01) while still being selective. P-values were not computed for constituents with fewer than eight data values in a subbasin or for those for which more than one-third of the data were censored. Boxplots, Dotplots, and Spatial Plots Boxplots are presented for select constituents and were constructed by using the \u201cgeom_boxplot\u201d function of the \u201cggplot2\u201d R package, version 3.2.1 (Wickham, 2016). Data were aggregated by subbasin, in addition to being presented for the study area as a whole. The five summary statistics presented on these plots are as follows: (1) Upper whisker = extension from the third quartile to the largest value that is no greater than the third quartile plus 1.5 times the interquartile range (IQR) of the data; (2) Upper hinge = the third quartile (75th quantile); (3) Median = the median data value (50th quantile); (4) Lower hinge = the first quartile (25th quantile); and (5) Lower whisker = extension from the first quartile (25-percent quantile) to the smallest value that is no less than the first quartile minus 1.5 times the IQR of the data. Values that fall beyond the upper and lower whiskers are typically plotted individually and are sometimes classified as outliers or outside values (Tukey, 1977). In this case, dotplots were overlaid on the boxplots by using the \u201cgeom_dotplot\u201d function in the \u201cggplot2\u201d R package, version 3.2.1 (Wickham, 2016), and a distinct symbol was used to denote outside val\u00ad ues. This approach was taken to favor a more informative pre\u00ad sentation of data structure. Dotplot bin width was one-thirtieth (3.33 percent) of each constituent\u2019s data range\u2014the default setting for the \u201cgeom_dotplot\u201d function (Wickham, 2016). 24 Hydrogeology and Groundwater Quality in the San Agustin Basin, New Mexico, 1975\u20132019 Spatial plots that were made in ArcGIS Pro (version 2.5.0) are also presented for the same select constitu\u00ad ents. Data points were sized and colored according to their magnitude and bin thresholds corresponding to the summary statistics described above. The appropriate quartile(s) plus and (or) minus 1.5 times the IQR of the data were included as thresholds in instances where data values extended beyond the upper and (or) lower whiskers\u2014this differed from the boxplot whiskers, which terminated at a data point rather than extending to a calculated value. Stable Isotopes Stable isotope ratio interpretation was facilitated by con\u00ad structing a scatterplot of \u03b418O versus \u03b42H. Data values were over\u00ad laid on the local meteoric water line (LMWL) for the Middle Rio Grande Basin, as estimated by Plummer and others (2012), in addition to the global meteoric water line (GMWL) (Craig, 1961). These data values were colored by subbasin and symbol\u00ad ized by aquifer unit. Spatial plots, like those described above, were also constructed with the stable isotope data, and Wilcoxon tests were performed to compare the east and west subbasin data. Table 5.

Methods 25 Principal Component Analysis PCA was used to further compare east and west subbasin groundwater chemistry. PCA is an unsupervised exploratory data analysis technique that is commonly used to better understand and visualize data structure. This technique is accomplished by reprojecting the data as weighted linear com\u00ad binations of all data variables to ease pattern recognition and identify influential variables (Hastie and others, 2009; James and others, 2013). The linear combinations are called principal components (PCs) and are computed such that they account for a descending amount of dataset variance. Therefore, PC1 accounts for the most variance in the data, followed by PC2, and so on. There are as many PCs as there are analyzed vari\u00ad ables, and they have the following mathematical form: \u200bP \u200bC\u200b i\u200b \u200b= \u200b\u03bb\u200b 1\u200b \u200bV\u200b 1\u200b + \u200b\u03bb\u200b 2\u200b \u200bV\u200b 2\u200b + \u2026 + \u200b\u03bb\u200b nvar\u200b \u200bV\u200b nvar\u200b\b (4) where P Ci is principal component score (\u200bi\u200b = 1 to nvar); \u03bbi is the weight (also known as loading) derived from PCA, where subscripts denote variable number; Vi is the original data value for a given variable, where subscripts denote variable number; and nvar is total number of variables analyzed. Loadings are calculated by using eigen decomposition and are related to the correlation between variables and the amount of variance explained by a variable (Hastie and others, 2009; James and others, 2013). In this study, variables were chemical constituents, and the data were a subset of the 2010\u201319 groundwater chemistry data. Select chemical constituents and sampled sites were excluded from the PCA to meet the method\u2019s requirement of a complete data matrix, meaning no missing or censored values are acceptable. PCA was therefore performed on two dataset variants. The first variant favored more sites (41 total) at the expense of analyzing fewer constituents (17 total), whereas the second variant analyzed more constituents (25 total) but fewer sites (34 total). The results from both analyses were similar; therefore, only the second variant (25 constituents, 34 sites) is presented for simplicity and to permit the evaluation of more constituents. Overall, 51 percent of available chemical constituents were con\u00ad sidered at 77 percent of available sites. The considered chemical constituents were arsenic, bicarbonate (filtered), boron, bromide, calcium, chloride, chromium, \u03b42H, \u03b418O, dissolved oxygen, fluo\u00ad ride, hardness, lithium, magnesium, pH (field), potassium, silica, sodium, strontium, sulfate, temperature, TDS (dried), uranium, vanadium, and zinc. The excluded sites were sites 2, 6, 7, 10, 18, 19, 31, 32, 42, and 44. Specific conductance was omitted from the analysis because it was well represented by dried TDS (Pearson correlation coefficient = 0.97). This analysis yielded a nearly even distribution of sites between the east (16 sites, 47 percent) and west (18 sites, 53 percent) subbasins, although data availability limitations resulted in densely spaced sites in the western portion of the west subbasin. West subbasin data and associated interpre\u00ad tations are therefore more biased towards this part of the subbasin. PCA results can be sensitive to outliers, thereby requiring anomalous data values to be addressed prior to analysis (Hastie and others, 2009). Boxplots were evaluated to identify potential outliers that could skew PCA results. Outlier data were consid\u00ad ered to be those that met the \u201cfar out\u201d value criterion proposed by Tukey (1977). This criterion flags any data point as a poten\u00ad tial outlier when it lies beyond the third or first quartile plus or minus, respectively, three times the interquartile range of the data. This approach is versatile, as it does not require assump\u00ad tions about the distribution of the data, and is typically consid\u00ad ered to be a conservative outlier classification scheme (Iglewicz and Hoaglin, 1993). Overall, just 1.6 percent (14 of 850) of data values for a total of nine constituents met this criterion. Five constituents (arsenic, boron, chloride, sulfate, uranium) had just one anomalous data value, three constituents (bromide, lithium, strontium) had two values, and one constituent (zinc) had three values. All identified outliers were anomalously high, rather than low, relative to the rest of the data. The influence of outliers on PCA was reduced by lowering the values of outlier data to the corresponding \u201cfar out\u201d value criteria, thus making the outlier data less extreme but still maintaining a degree of their abnormality. This approach is called winsorizing and was favored over removal of the outliers and their corresponding site or constituent (Ghosh and Vogt, 2012). PCA was implemented by using the \u201cprcomp\u201d function of the \u201cstats\u201d base R package, version 3.5.3 (R Core Team, 2019). Data were shifted to be zero centered and scaled to have a unit variance, as advised in most cases, especially when constituent units differ (Hastie and others, 2009; James and others, 2013). Biplots were produced by using the \u201cggbiplot\u201d function within the \u201cggbiplot\u201d R package, version 0.55 (Vu, 2011). Biplot data were colored by east and west subbasin to facilitate comparison. Additionally, Wilcoxon tests, as described above, were performed on all PC scores to further compare the chemistry variability"

Additionally, Wilcoxon tests, as described above, were performed on all PC scores to further compare the chemistry variability between the subbasins. Clustering algorithms are often applied to PCA results to identify groups of similar data within the reprojected PC domain. K-means and hierarchical clustering techniques (Hastie and others, 2009; James and others, 2013) were performed on the PCA results, but a lack of strong cluster structure in the data and seemingly ambiguous cluster patterns discouraged interpretation and presentation of the clustering results. Cluster structure was evaluated in terms of the mean silhouette widths computed for cluster solutions of 1\u201310 clusters by using the \u201csilhouette\u201d function of the \u201ccluster\u201d base R package, version 2.0.7\u20131 (Maechler and others, 2019). The mean silhouette width metric attempts to classify the likeness, or similarity, of data that are assigned to the same clusters and ranges from \u22121 to 1 (Everitt and others, 2011). Cluster solutions with a mean silhouette width of about 0.5 or greater are thought to be reasonable solutions, whereas those of about 0.2 or less represent a lack of substantial cluster structure (Everitt and others, 2011). Maximum mean silhouette width calculated in this study was 0.34, which was between the aforementioned criteria. Further inspection of clustering results revealed minimal aquifer or spatial dependence of clus\u00ad tering results, which further suggested a lack of meaningful cluster structure. 26 Hydrogeology and Groundwater Quality in the San Agustin Basin, New Mexico, 1975\u20132019 Groundwater Age Qualitative groundwater age, or residence time, was evaluated by using the 2010\u201319 tritium data. Tritium is a radioactive isotope of hydrogen with a half-life of 12.32 years (Lucas and Unterweger, 2000). Widespread atomic bomb test\u00ad ing in the 1950s and 1960s substantially increased atmospheric tritium concentrations, which have been declining following the suspension of aboveground atomic testing (Motzer, 2008). This anthropogenic flux of atmospheric tritium elevated the tritium concentrations in groundwater that was recharged after about 1953, relative to that which recharged prior to 1953. As a result, groundwater tritium concentrations can qualitatively indicate groundwater age. The classification system developed by Lindsey and others (2019) was used to determine premod\u00ad ern (before 1953) and modern (1953 and after) age thresholds for the tritium measurements, where values between these two thresholds were classified as being mixed. Tritium estimates in precipitation for threshold computations were obtained from a quadrangle map (lat 33\u00b0 to 35\u00b0 N., long \u2212105\u00b0 to \u2212110\u00b0 W.) of Michel and others (2018). Following Lindsey and others (2019), a premodern threshold of 0.61 pCi/L was computed by using the average estimated precipitation tritium concentration from 2008 through 2012 (Michel and others, 2018). Modern thresholds were calculated for 2010 (7.16 pCi/L) and again for 2019 (4.32 pCi/L) to give a range of thresholds to account for the short half-life of tritium. Groundwater ages were also estimated by using carbon-14, which is a naturally occurring radioactive isotope of carbon with a half-life of about 5,730 years (Plummer and others, 2012). The long half-life of carbon-14 makes it ideal for estimating the age of groundwater that recharged about 100 years ago to groundwater that recharged more than 20,000 years ago (Nishikawa and others, 2004). Per standard practice, carbon-14 data were reported as absolute percent modern, which had been normalized to a common carbon-13 value of \u221225 per mil by the reporting laboratory. To facilitate interpretation, these values were denormalized to units of percent modern carbon by using the approach of Plummer and others (2012) as follows: \u200b \u200ba\u200b D\u200b \u200b= \u200ba\u200b N\u200b \u200b[\u200b(1 + \u03b413C / 1, 000)\u200b / 0.975]\u200b 2\u200b \u200b exp\u200b[\u2212 \u200b(t \u2212 1, 950)\u200b / 8, 267]\u200b \u200b\b (5) where aD is the denormalized carbon-14 of the sample at the time of sample collection, in percent modern carbon; aN is the reported normalized carbon-14, in absolute percent modern; \u03b413C is the delta carbon-13/carbon-12 of the dissolved inorganic carbon, in per mil; t is the calendar year of sample collection, in YYYY format; and 8,267 is 1/\u03bb, where \u03bb is the carbon-14 decay constant, or (ln 2)/(5,730) in this study, where 5,730 is the modern carbon-14 half-life in years. The denormalized carbon-14 data in percent modern carbon were derived relative to the specific activity of National Bureau of Standards oxalic acid, where 13.56 disinte\u00ad grations per minute per gram of carbon in the year 1950 equals 100 percent modern carbon (pmC) (Nishikawa and others, 2004). As for tritium, atomic testing in the 1950s and 1960s increased atmospheric carbon-14 levels, sometimes yielding percent modern carbon values exceeding 100 pmC for waters recharged after about 1950 (Nishikawa and others, 2004). Generally, larger carbon-14 values indicate younger waters, whereas smaller carbon-14 values represent older waters. Carbon-14 values were spatially plotted to permit qualitative interpretation of their relative concentrations. The measured percent modern carbon concentrations that were qualitatively interpreted were not corrected for subsurface sources of carbon-14 that can commonly make groundwater seem older than it truly is (Nishikawa and others, 2004). Corrected carbon-14 ages that considered radioactive decay and subsurface chemical reaction with carbonate sources were calculated to provide quantitative groundwater age estimates. Sites that had carbon-14 data but lacked dis\u00ad solved inorganic carbon data, such as bicarbonate and carbon\u00ad ate, were excluded from correction analysis because of the inability to make reasonable corrections. Corrected carbon-14 groundwater ages in general are inherently uncertain because of the difficulty in comprehensively accounting for subsurface chemical reactions and mixing that may affect computed ages. This uncertainty should be kept in mind when interpreting results from this type of analysis and an estimated age range is reported"

This uncertainty should be kept in mind when interpreting results from this type of analysis and an estimated age range is reported herein. Model 11 \u201cRevised F&G solid ex\u201d (revised Fontes and Garnier solid exchange; Han and Plummer, 2013) in NetpathXL was used to model corrected groundwater ages on the basis of total dissolved inorganic carbon (sum of inorganic carbon species carbonic acid, bicarbonate, and carbonate), carbon-13, and carbon-14 data (Parkhurst and Charlton, 2008). The model assumes that the carbon inputs to the system are from soil gas and dissolution of carbonate species and estimates groundwater age based on the carbon\u00ad ate dissolution and change in carbon isotopic value (Han and Plummer, 2013). The presence of bicarbonate and calcium, along with relatively low delta carbon-13/carbon-12 values, in sampled groundwater implied groundwater interaction with a carbonate source and thereby suggested that the selected model was appropriate for the study area. Carbon-14 values of 0 pmC for solid carbonate and 100 pmC for soil gas were assumed, along with carbon-13 values of \u22121.85 per mil for solid carbonate (Muller and Mayo, 1986) and \u221221 and \u221216 per mil for soil gas (Huth and others, 2019). The two soil gas val\u00ad ues were assumed to be reasonable bounding representations of anticipated soil conditions on the basis of typical values and were both modeled to provide a range for the corrected carbon-14 ages at each site. These corrected age calculations made no attempt to account for younger waters mixing with older waters. Samples were then plotted using the method from Han and Plummer (2016) and the aforementioned assumed values to further understand the reaction and mixing Results and Discussion 27 processes potentially influencing the carbon-14 age results. This plotting procedure was used to qualify age estimates on the basis of their expected reliability. The details of this plot\u00ad ting procedure are discussed in the \u201cResults and Discussion\u201d section of this report. Results and Discussion Groundwater Elevation Results from the groundwater elevation analyses can be used to interpret prominent groundwater flow patterns in the San Agustin Basin, along with the temporal dynamics of those patterns over the 1975 through 2019 period. Kriging estimations of median groundwater elevation within the basin-fill and alluvium aquifer system are shown in figure 7. Groundwater elevations were highest and had the steepest gra\u00ad dients near the foothills of the Mangas and Datil Mountains. Gradients were lowest along the east-west central axis of the basin. East subbasin groundwater elevations were generally higher than those of the west subbasin. Interpreted groundwater flow patterns are illustrated in figure 7. These patterns were derived by using the hydrologic principle that groundwater flows in directions that are perpen\u00ad dicular to groundwater elevation contours and from high to low values of hydraulic head (Ingebritsen and others, 2006). These results indicate that groundwater flows from the high\u00ad lands towards the east-west central axis of the basin, where it then generally moves from east to west. There were localized areas of relatively low groundwater elevations in the eastern portion of the east subbasin, but nearby historical median groundwater elevation data near the watershed boundary were larger than the interpolated elevations (fig. 7). These lower elevations are therefore not an implication of eastward ground\u00ad water movement but are instead localized map features that are driven by data scarcity. The lowest groundwater elevations were in the southwestern portion of the west subbasin, sug\u00ad gesting underflow through the local highlands into the north\u00ad ern East Fork Gila River watershed. Data from site 6 informed the lowest estimated groundwater elevations in this area, with a median groundwater elevation of 6,721.05 ft, which was about 19 ft less than the nearest observed median values at sites 8 and 9 (table 4, fig. 4). Therefore, additional data are required to more confidently evaluate the groundwater con\u00ad nectivity of the basin with the northern East Fork Gila River watershed.

Previous researchers who considered different time periods of groundwater elevation data reported similar groundwater flow patterns, thereby suggesting that subbasin connectivity is common through time (Blodgett and Titus, 1973; Myers and others, 1994; Rinehart and others, 2017). Median annual gradients (groundwater elevation change over time) for 1975 through 2019 are presented in figure 9. Unlike the kriging analysis, the temporal analysis considered all wells with repeat measurements, regardless of aquifer type, throughout the entire study area (98 wells). Because median annual gradients were calculated for any site that had at least two measurements from 1975 through 2019, the gradients are not necessarily representative of the entire period of investigation but serve as reasonable estimates. The region considered for the groundwater elevation map is outlined in figure 9 for context. Generally, temporal gradients indicate that most groundwater elevations in the lowlands changed little (\u22120.2 to 0.2 foot per year [ft/yr]), thereby also suggesting that lowland groundwater flow patterns have likely been more or less stable over time under current climate and development conditions. This finding supports the use of median data values in the kriging analysis as a reasonable representation of lowland groundwater elevations within the basin-fill and alluvium aquifer system; 71 percent of the 63 contoured sites with repeat measurements had annual gradients between \u22120.2 and 0.2 ft/yr. A group of irrigation wells in the northeast basin was a notable exception to the stability of lowland groundwater elevations over time; this deviation was likely due to variable irrigation pumping throughout the period of interest. Groundwater elevations were more time sensitive in the highlands, where precipitation is more prevalent and rela\u00ad tively shallow depths to groundwater are more common (Phillips and others, 1992; Myers and others, 1994; Rinehart and others, 2017). This contrast with the lowlands is evidence that most groundwater recharge takes place in the highlands, with minimal recharge in the lowlands, and is consistent with the groundwater flow patterns depicted in figure 7. Median change for all sites was \u22120.05 ft/yr, which indicates that groundwater elevations may have slightly declined on average between 1975 and 2019. Overall, 86 of the 98 sites (88 percent) had median annual gradi\u00ad ents between \u22120.5 and 0.5 ft/yr, and 51 of those sites (52 percent) had values between \u22120.1 and 0.1 ft/yr (fig. 9). 28 Hydrogeology and Groundwater Quality in the San Agustin Basin, New Mexico, 1975\u20132019 34\u00b020' 108\u00b020' 108\u00b0 107\u00b040' 34\u00b0 33\u00b040' GALLINAS MOUNTAINS Datil SAN MATEO MOUNTAINS MONTICELLO CANYON BLACK RANGE LUERA MOUNTAINS TULAROSA MOUNTAINS MANGAS MOUNTAINS McClure Hills Base from Esri 2018 and its licensors Geographic coordinate system North American Datum of 1983 Northern East Fork Gila River watershed 0 5 10 MILES 0 5 10 KILOMETERS EXPLANATION San Agustin Basin (study area) boundary Subbasin boundary Well used for contouring (124 wells) Historical median groundwater elevation data outside of contoured area (9 wells) (numbers next to symbols refer to measured groundwater elevation, in feet above North American Vertical Datum of 1988) Excluded area of high standard errors Estimated groundwater flow direction 6,545 6,750 Estimated median groundwater elevations from the application of kriging, in feet above North American Vertical Datum of 1988 6,775 6,886 6,665 6,996 7,106 Estimated median groundwater elevation from the application of kriging, in feet above North American Vertical Datum of 1988\u2014Contour interval is 50 feet DATIL MOUNTAINS 6,592 6,545 6,732 6,838 6,906 7,0637,234 7,281 6,842 6,800 6,850 6,850 6,800 6,750 6,750 6,950 6,950 6,900 7,000 6,900 6,950 6,750 6,750 6,750 7,050 6,700 6,800 6,800 6,850 6,850 6,850 6,850 6,800 6,800 6,800 6,850 12 60 60 Basin and subbasin boundaries based on surface water hydrologic units derived by U.S. Geological Survey (1999) Figure 7.

Results and Discussion 31 Groundwater Chemistry Groundwater chemistry results can further illustrate the dynamics of groundwater flow in the San Agustin Basin, and general water quality knowledge is helpful for residents, resource managers, and other stakeholders. The major ion chemistry of basin groundwater is presented on a Piper dia\u00ad gram in figure 10. Waters were mainly bicarbonate-carbonate type with a broad distribution of cation chemistry across cal\u00ad cium, sodium, and potassium. Three sites (1, 2, and 6) in the west subbasin had notably elevated chloride concentrations, and one site (31) in the west subbasin had a larger sulfate concentration relative to most sites (labeled in fig. 10). Major ion chemistry showed minimal dependence on aquifer type, suggesting that the aquifers are generally well connected. Major ion chemistry was also similar in both the east and west subbasins. Subbasin chemistry results for 2010 through 2019 were quantitatively compared to one another by using Wilcoxon tests, where p-values less than 0.05 were assumed to indicate statistically distinct chemistry between subbasins. The Wilcoxon test results for all analyzed constituents are pre\u00ad sented in figure 11 and table 6. Of the constituents considered, only potassium (p-value = 0.04) and temperature (p-value = 0.04) yielded statistically significant p-values. Thus, with these two slight exceptions, the data did not demonstrate a statistically significant difference between subbasins. Spatial plots, dotplots, and boxplots of groundwater potassium con\u00ad centrations and temperatures are shown in figures 12 and 13, respectively. Colors and sizes of data points in the spatial plots were selected on the basis of quartiles for each constituent (see \u201cMethods\u201d section). Potassium concentrations were greater in the west subbasin (median = 2.13 mg/L) compared to the east subbasin (median = 1.60 mg/L). Potassium concentrations were highest in the southwestern portion of the west subbasin; the process resulting in these larger concentrations was not readily apparent but could be further explored in the future. Temperatures varied more and were larger in the east subbasin (median = 17.50 degrees Celsius) relative to the west subbasin (median = 16.00 degrees Celsius). Sampling conditions, such as air temperature and flow rate, can affect measured ground\u00ad water temperature. However, median well depths of sampled sites in the east and west subbasins were 469 ft and 210 ft, respectively. Therefore, the subbasin temperature contrast is consistent with a relation to well depth, since subsurface tem\u00ad peratures typically increase linearly with depth (Ingebritsen and others, 2006). A Wilcoxon test comparing well depths in the subbasins yielded a p-value of 0.002, which was substan\u00ad tially less than the assumed significance level of 0.05 and offered further support that the temperature differential is a result of well depth variation. Groundwater quality was generally good throughout the basin in comparison with EPA drinking water standards. TDS concentrations had a median of 211 mg/L and ranged from 154 to 572 mg/L (fig. 14). Site 31 near the McClure Hills (fig. 14) was the only sampled site in excess of the TDS SMCL of 500 mg/L (table 5). TDS concentrations were greater than average in groundwater from some sites within the south\u00ad western portion of the west subbasin (fig. 14). A prominent gap in recent TDS data exists for the lowest elevations of the west subbasin (between sites13 and 26) because the lack of wells with existing groundwater pumps does not allow practi\u00ad cal sampling. Historical data and anecdotal accounts indicated poor water quality within the lacustrine and playa deposits in this area, with TDS, as estimated from specific conductance data, exceeding 25,000 mg/L (site identifier 334927108133301 in table 3.1 in app. 3). A systematic lateral trend in TDS was not observed despite the east to west regional groundwater flow pattern indicated in the groundwater elevation map (fig. 7). Generally, TDS would be expected to increase down\u00ad gradient because of rock/water interactions. The lack of this pattern may be the result of mixing with local recharge and variable sediment reactivity. Depending on the local geology where recharge occurs, that groundwater could have either larger TDS, contributing to the typical pattern of larger TDS downgradient, or smaller TDS, contributing to the lack of a clear pattern. It is also possible that localized flow paths may pass through low-permeability playa deposits that are con\u00ad tinuing to release high TDS groundwater over time, whereas other flow paths travel around these locations. Faulting and the complex multigraben structure of the basin also likely lead to variable groundwater residence times and regional flow rates, further obscuring the expected TDS pattern. The median groundwater pH value was 7.90, which is slightly basic but still within the EPA SMCL range of 6.5\u20138.5 for pH (table 5). Measured pH values ranged from 6.4 to 9.0. Two sites (19 and 20) had pH values that were less than the SMCL, whereas three sites (32, 37, and 44) had values in excess of the SMCL. Groundwater pH in the east subbasin spatially varied more than that of the west subbasin (fig. 15), with variances of 0.52 and 0.07, respectively. Measured pH values were predominantly more basic along the subbasin divide near the McClure Hills and Luera Mountains. While most sites complied with EPA drinking water standards for"

While most sites complied with EPA drinking water standards for TDS and pH, some sites exceeded EPA levels for other constituents (table 5). Two sites (27 and 41) exceeded the EPA MCL for arsenic of 10 \u00b5g/L. Three sites (2, 21, and 27) exceeded the SMCL of 2 mg/L for fluoride. One site (38) slightly exceeded the nitrate MCL of 10 mg/L. In addition to exceeding the TDS SMCL, one site (31) had a sulfate concentration of 275 mg/L (table 3.1 in app. 3), which slightly exceeded the sulfate SMCL of 250 mg/L. Overall, exceedances of EPA drinking water standards were rare and not extreme, thereby suggesting that water quality in the sampled wells is generally favorable for consumption. The composition of stable isotopes in groundwater can help identify recharge elevation and season, evaporative signals, and geothermal contributions to further inform the understanding of groundwater dynamics (Faure, 1986; Kendall and others, 1995). A scatterplot of \u03b418O and \u03b42H groundwater 32 Hydrogeology and Groundwater Quality in the San Agustin Basin, New Mexico, 1975\u20132019 stable isotope ratios, along with the LMWL and GMWL, is presented in figure 16. \u03b42H values ranged from \u221288.80 to \u221261.39 per mil, and \u03b418O values ranged from \u221212.25 to \u22127.69 per mil. Most samples plotted along the LMWL for the Middle Rio Grande Basin (Plummer and others, 2012) and approximately paralleled the GMWL (Craig, 1961) with a right shift. Site 27 plotted notably to the left of both meteoric water lines, whereas sites 23 and 38 plotted notably to the right. The latter samples may be associated with evapora\u00ad tion prior to infiltration, a minor geothermal component, or mixing with evaporated or geothermal waters. Stable iso\u00ad tope values showed no clear dependence on aquifer type or subbasin (figs. 11 and 16). Furthermore, no correlation was found with land-surface elevation for the sampled wells (\u03b42H Pearson correlation coefficient = 0.02; \u03b418O Pearson cor\u00ad relation coefficient = \u22120.05), which is expected because of Calcium CATIONS Magnesium Carbonate + bicarbonate Calcium + magnesium Sodium + potassium Sulfate Chloride + sulfate Chloride ANIONS 80 60 40 20 80 100 60 40 20 0 0 20 40 60 80 20 40 60 80 100 0 20 40 60 80 100 80 60 40 20 20 40 60 80 100 80 60 40 20 0 100 80 60 40 20 0 100 80 60 40 20 0 Percentage of total ions, in milliequivalents per liter EXPLANATION Aquifer type 2 1 6 31 West subbasin East subbasin Basin-fill and alluvium (numbers next to select symbols refer to figure identifiers for sites) Datil Group Spears Formation Unknown (numbers next to select symbols refer to figure identifiers for sites) Basin-fill and alluvium Datil Group Spears Formation Unknown 2 31 Figure 10.

Wilcoxon tests comparing east and west subbasin groundwater isotopes yielded p-values of about 0.6 for both isotopes (fig. 11). Despite minimal quantitative distinction between east and west subbasin stable isotope values, the most isotopically depleted (most negative) values were more common in the eastern portion of the basin (figs. 17 and 18). This pattern may be influenced by recharge at higher elevations and (or) colder temperatures. Principal Component Analysis PCA was performed on select constituents to further compare east and west subbasin groundwater chemistry. A biplot displaying reprojected PC values (scores) and cor\u00ad responding variable loading vectors for PC1 and PC2 is presented in figure 19. The length and orientation of loading vectors correspond to variable influence on the associated PCs. Loading vector arrowheads point in the direction of high origi\u00ad nal data values, whereas low values plot directly 180 degrees from arrowheads. The first two PCs accounted for 52.2 percent of total dataset variance and had loading vectors that were generally similar in length. Much of the data grouped towards the top of the biplot opposite from most loading-vector arrowheads, indicating that low values of constituents were common with dataset variance largely being the result of less common elevated values. No systematic point separation by subbasin was evident in the biplot. This overlap of sites from both subbasins within the PC domain is further evidence that groundwater chemistry is largely similar in the two subbasins. Wilcoxon tests were performed on the PC scores from each subbasin to quantitatively compare subbasin chemistry in the reprojected PC domain; a p-value significance level of 0.05 was again assumed to indicate distinct PC scores for the subbasins. Resulting p-values are presented in figure 20. P-values for all PCs, except for PC6 (p-value = 0.003) and PC9 (p-value = 0.01), were greater than the significance level. A biplot of PC6 and PC9 is presented in figure 21, which shows a clear separation between points from each subbasin. Examination of the PCA loadings in this plot indicated larger pH, enriched stable isotopes, and larger chloride concentra\u00ad tions in the west subbasin and larger temperatures and sulfate concentrations in the east subbasin. On the basis of PCA, these constituents therefore represent the main groundwater chemis\u00ad try differences between the subbasins, although Wilcoxon tests indicated that temperature (p-value = 0.04) was the only statis\u00ad tically significant of these constituents between the subbasins, as previously discussed.

Groundwater Age Tritium is a useful tracer for determining if groundwater was recharged approximately before or after the year 1953. Following the approach of Lindsey and others (2019), tritium concentrations less than or equal to 0.61 pCi/L were classified as indicating premodern groundwater (before 1953), those greater than 4.32 pCi/L (2019 threshold) and 6.41 pCi/L (2010 threshold) were classified as indicating modern (1953 and after) recharge, and those in between were classified as indicating a mixture of premodern and modern recharge. Measured tritium concentrations ranged from less than the reporting level to 4.31 pCi/L (table 7). Eight of forty-four total sites (18.2 percent) exceeded the 0.61 pCi/L threshold for pre\u00ad modern waters; these eight sites were less than the thresholds set for modern waters, indicating that they are likely a mixture of old and modern waters. These low concentrations indicated Table 6.

Results and Discussion 39 that there was minimal presence of modern (1953 and after) groundwater in the sampled basin aquifer system, which sug\u00ad gests that current recharge rates are very low. Sites classified as being of mixed age were mainly located in the highlands, within arroyos, and (or) near the outlet of prominent arroyos within both subbasins (fig. 22). This pattern implies that most recharge likely occurs at higher elevations through mountain- block recharge and as focused recharge within arroyos, which is consistent with the findings of previous studies (Myers and others, 1994). Denormalized carbon-14 concentrations in percent modern carbon and corrected carbon-14 groundwater ages can add additional insight into groundwater flow patterns and recharge characteristics. Generally, larger carbon-14 concen\u00ad trations indicate younger waters, whereas smaller carbon-14 concentrations indicate older waters, thereby permitting qualitative interpretation of relative values. Carbon-14 values near 100 pmC represent young (hundreds of years) waters, and values closer to 0 pmC represent old (tens of thousands of years) waters (Nishikawa and others, 2004).

Bin thresholds for spatially plotted data points were based on data quartiles (see \u201cMethods\u201d section for more details). Figure identifiers correspond to those used in the tables of this report. 42 Hydrogeology and Groundwater Quality in the San Agustin Basin, New Mexico, 1975\u20132019 distribution of carbon-14 values was similar to that for tritium concentrations (fig. 22), with the highest carbon-14 measure\u00ad ments (59.1\u201395.0 pmC, younger waters) corresponding to sites in highlands and near or within arroyos (fig. 23 and table 7). Smaller carbon-14 values (9.6\u201325.5 pmC, older waters) were more common in the east subbasin, though low values, notably near the McClure Hills, were measured in both subbasins. Carbon-14 values may be expected to decrease from east to west in accordance with evidenced regional groundwater flow patterns (fig. 7), but that pattern is not prominent in figure 23. The lowest measured carbon-14 values were near or within the grabens of the east subbasin (fig. 1). This pattern suggests that these grabens have prolonged groundwater residence times and may strongly influence groundwater flow rates in the basin. The lack of a clear regional trend is also likely influ\u00ad enced by heterogeneity in subsurface permeability that creates spatially inconsistent groundwater flow rates and mixing with local recharge of variable age. Sites 22, 31, and 37 formed a group of low carbon-14 values. This group is bisected by the subbasin divide of the McClure Hills, thereby indicating that the subbasins are likely hydrologically connected through the McClure Hills. Other low carbon-14 values at sites 12 and 26 were located near the lowest elevations of the basin in the west subbasin. Larger measured carbon-14 concentrations near the potential basin discharge area support the role of ground\u00ad water mixing and recharge in the observed spatial distribution of carbon-14 values. Corrected carbon-14 groundwater ages are presented in table 7 and further support the groundwater dynamics identi\u00ad fied in the tritium and carbon-14 concentration interpretations. Corrected groundwater ages are inherently uncertain because of the difficulty in comprehensively accounting for subsurface carbon exchange and mixing.

Results and Discussion 43 can help elucidate potential processes influencing carbon water chemistry and age uncertainties (fig. 24). The solid black and dashed black lines on this plot represent the \u201czero age\u201d lines, which are determined from representative carbon-14 and carbon-13 estimates of soil gas and solid carbonate. The solid black lines represent \u221221 per mil carbon-13 for soil gas, whereas the dashed black lines represent \u221216 per mil. The areas enclosed by the \u201czero age\u201d lines are referred to as the \u201czero age\u201d areas. Samples plotting in these areas do not have a calculated radiocarbon age and may be explained by geochemical reaction with no radiocarbon decay and could therefore be young waters. Samples plotting above these areas are potentially a mixture of young and old waters. Samples plotting below these areas are more likely to have undergone radiocarbon decay and are thereby considered to be associated with reliable age estimates. Several samples plotted within and above the \u201czero age\u201d areas and have estimated ages listed as \u201cNA\u201d in table 7 to reflect the poor reliability of their age estimates. Samples from several sites, in both the east and west subbasins, plotted below the \u201czero age\u201d areas when using the \u221221 per mil carbon-13 for soil gas. These sites included 15, 16, 19, 39, and 43 in the east subbasin and sites 5, 11, 12, 24, and 26 in the west subbasin (fig. 24 and table 7). Site 41 (east subbasin) is the only additional site below the \u201czero age\u201d area when using the \u221216 per mil carbon-13 for soil gas. Sites 8 and 14 plot below the \u201czero age\u201d areas but are to the upper left of the Tamers\u2019 X and Y crossings (also known as the Tamers\u2019 points; eqs. 22 and 23, respectively, from Han and Plummer, 2016), which indicates that these samples have likely undergone isotopic exchange primarily with soil gas. The methods needed to estimate corrected ages for these two samples require additional simplifying assumptions and yield highly uncertain results without local carbon-13 soil gas concentration measurements; estimated corrected ages were therefore not computed for these samples (\u201cNC\u201d in table 7). Corrected age estimates ranged from 232 to 13,916 years before present with a median of 5,409 years old. These results indicate that a wide range of groundwater ages is present in the basin with waters commonly being thousands of years old, thereby suggesting that regional groundwater movement is generally slow. Eight of the eighteen sites (44 percent) for which corrected age estimates could not be obtained were classified as mixed in the tritium analysis (table 7) or consis\u00ad tently plotted in the \u201czero age\u201d areas, thereby suggesting that a component of relatively young groundwater is present in the basin and that it often mixes with older waters.

Gradual groundwater elevation gradients near the east and west subbasin divide suggest that any groundwater moving from the east subbasin to the west subbasin moves at slow rates, which is further supported by groundwater age estimates near the subbasin divide. Despite evidenced subbasin connectivity and regional east to west estimated groundwater flow patterns, a systematic east to west groundwater evolution in water chemistry was not observed, and groundwater chemistry in the subbasins was generally similar. These findings suggest that groundwater mixing is regionally prevalent, sediment reactivity is low and variable, and (or) recharge conditions are comparable in both subbasins. Additional geochemical analyses may be able to further evalu\u00ad ate the degree of subbasin connectivity through advanced geochemical modeling techniques in the future. Groundwater elevations were lowest in the southwestern portion of the west subbasin, where estimated groundwater flow directions suggest underflow through the local highlands into the northern East Fork Gila River watershed, which is further supported by historical groundwater elevation data from the northern East Fork Gila River watershed. Low groundwater elevations upgradient from this potential regional discharge area suggest that groundwater movement towards the northern East Fork Gila River watershed is likely at slow rates. Relatively young groundwater age estimates in this portion of the basin suggest that groundwater mixes with local recharge in this area.

Summary 49 Summary The U.S. Geological Survey in cooperation with the Bureau of Land Management performed this study to improve the understanding of present-day (1975\u20132019) hydrogeology and groundwater quality of the San Agustin Basin (basin) in west-central New Mexico to support sustainable ground\u00ad water resource management. The basin hosts a relatively undeveloped basin-fill and alluvium aquifer system and is topographically divided into east and west subbasins by the McClure Hills. This work included the compilation and col\u00ad lection of groundwater chemistry (major ions, trace elements, stable isotopes, and groundwater age tracers) and groundwater elevation data along with the interpretation of these data in the context of groundwater flow and quality. The analyses included in this report considered groundwater chemistry data collected within the last decade (2010\u201319) and groundwater elevation data collected from 1975 through 2019; the longer timespan for groundwater elevation data was used in order to address sparsity in data collected over the last decade. Groundwater elevation analyses included construction of a groundwater elevation map and assessment of the time dependence of groundwater elevations to estimate the dynam\u00ad ics of groundwater flow. The groundwater elevation map indicates that groundwater flows from the highlands towards the east-west central axis of the basin, where it then generally moves from east to west. Estimated groundwater elevation gradients were gentle (about 2 feet per mile) near the subbasin divide, thereby suggesting that groundwater slowly flows from the east subbasin into the west subbasin. Groundwater eleva\u00ad tions were lowest in the southwestern portion of the west sub\u00ad basin, where estimated groundwater flow directions suggest underflow through the local highlands into the northern East Fork Gila River watershed, which is further supported by historical groundwater elevation data from the northern East Fork Gila River watershed. Low groundwater elevations upgradient from this potential regional discharge area suggest that groundwater movement towards the northern East Fork Gila River watershed is likely at slow rates. Median annual gradients (groundwater elevation change over time) from 1975 through 2019 indicate that most groundwater elevations in the lowlands changed little (\u22120.2 to 0.2 foot per year), thereby also suggesting that lowland groundwater flow patterns have likely been more or less stable over time under current climate and development conditions. Groundwater elevations were more time sensitive in the highlands, where precipitation is more prevalent and relatively shallow depths to groundwater are more common. This contrast with the lowlands is evidence that most groundwater recharge takes place in the highlands, with minimal recharge in the lowlands. Median change for all sites was \u22120.05 foot per year, which indicates that groundwater elevations may have slightly declined on average between 1975 and 2019. The general character and spatial variation of groundwater chemistry were also evaluated to further understand the qual\u00ad ity and movement of basin groundwater. Waters were mainly bicarbonate-carbonate type with a broad distribution of cation chemistry across calcium, sodium, and potassium. Major ion chemistry showed minimal dependence on aquifer type, suggesting that the aquifers are generally well connected. Major ion chemistry was also similar in both the east and west subbasins. Subbasin chemistry results for 2010 through 2019 were quantitatively compared to one another by using Wilcoxon tests, where probability values (p-values) less than 0.05 were assumed to indicate statistically distinct chemistry between subbasins. Of the constituents considered, only potassium (p-value = 0.04) and temperature (p-value = 0.04) yielded statistically significant p-values. Thus, with these two slight exceptions, the geochemistry data did not demonstrate a statistically significant difference between subbasins. Groundwater quality was generally good throughout the basin in comparison with U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) drinking water standards. Total dissolved solids (TDS) concentrations had a median of 211 milligrams per liter (mg/L) and ranged from 154 to 572 mg/L, with only one sampled site in excess of the EPA secondary maximum contaminant level of 500 mg/L for TDS. A prominent gap in recent TDS data exists for the lowest elevations of the west subbasin because of a lack of wells with existing groundwater pumps to allow practical sampling. Historical data and anec\u00ad dotal accounts indicated poor water quality within the lacus\u00ad trine and playa deposits in this area, with TDS, as estimated from specific conductance data, exceeding 25,000 mg/L. Overall, exceedances of EPA drinking water standards were rare and not extreme, thereby suggesting that water quality in the sampled wells is generally favorable for consumption. Stable isotope analysis showed that most samples plotted along the local meteoric water line for the Middle Rio Grande Basin, with no clear dependence on aquifer type or subbasin. Despite minimal quantitative distinction between east and west subbasin stable isotope values, the most isotopically depleted (most negative) values were more common in the eastern portion of the basin. This pattern may be influenced by recharge at higher elevations and (or) colder temperatures. Principal component analysis was performed on select constituents to further compare east and west subbasin ground\u00ad water chemistry. The first two principal components accounted for 52.2 percent of total dataset variance, had loading vectors that were generally similar in length, and showed no system\u00ad atic point separation by subbasin when plotted. These results further indicate that groundwater chemistry is largely similar in the two subbasins. Corrected carbon-14 groundwater age estimates in the basin ranged from 232 to 13,916 years before present with a median of 5,409"

Corrected carbon-14 groundwater age estimates in the basin ranged from 232 to 13,916 years before present with a median of 5,409 years. These results indicate that a wide range of groundwater ages is present in the basin with waters com\u00ad monly being thousands of years old, thereby suggesting that regional groundwater movement is generally slow. A com\u00ad ponent of relatively young groundwater, for which estimated ages could not be accurately computed, is also present in the basin, and it may commonly mix with older waters. The spatial distribution of categorical and quantitative groundwater 50 Hydrogeology and Groundwater Quality in the San Agustin Basin, New Mexico, 1975\u20132019 ages indicates that most recharge likely occurs in the highlands through mountain-block recharge and as focused recharge within arroyos, although evidence of modern (1953 and after) groundwater from tritium analysis was minimal at sampled sites. A group of sites with relatively old groundwater is bisected by the subbasin divide, thereby further supporting hydrologic connectivity of the subbasins through the McClure Hills. Despite evidenced subbasin connectivity and regional east to west estimated groundwater flow patterns, a systematic east to west groundwater evolution in water chemistry was not observed, and groundwater chemistry in the subbasins was generally similar. These findings suggest that groundwater mixing is regionally prevalent, sediment reactivity is low and variable, and (or) recharge conditions are comparable in both subbasins. Relatively young groundwater age estimates near the potential discharge area towards the northern East Fork Gila River watershed suggest that groundwater mixes with local recharge in this area. The regional spatial distribution of groundwater age estimates indicates that faulting and the com\u00ad plex multigraben structure of the basin likely lead to variable regional groundwater flow rates and residence times.
