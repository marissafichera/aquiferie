Below is a concise overview of the key recommended future work for understanding and managing groundwater in the Tularosa Basin, drawn from the text:

1. Enhanced Monitoring and Data Collection:  
   • Install additional monitoring wells at various depths to capture three-dimensional salinity distribution.  
   • Expand sampling frequency and locations to address gaps in spatial and temporal data.  
   • Continuously monitor groundwater levels and quality to assess seasonal and long-term trends.

2. Advanced Investigative Techniques:  
   • Employ geophysical methods (e.g., electrical resistivity) to better delineate subsurface salinity and structural controls.  
   • Utilize environmental tracers and stable isotopes to clarify recharge timing, origin, and flow paths.

3. Refined Geological and Hydrological Mapping:  
   • Develop detailed geologic maps and cross sections to visualize subsurface connections and barriers.  
   • Update regional water table maps and integrate new well records for improved modeling.

4. Recharge Process and Flow Path Analysis:  
   • Investigate mountain-block recharge (MBR), mountain-front recharge (MFR), and localized recharge processes to understand their impact on salinity patterns.  
   • Examine deep regional flow paths and fault interactions for insights into aquifer connectivity and discharge.

5. Focus on Special Features and Areas:  
   • Study high-elevation springs and perched aquifers to determine their hydrologic linkage to deeper systems.  
   • Assess evaporation effects in areas like Alkali Flat, Lake Lucero, and dune fields, exploring how salinity and water availability influence dune dynamics.  
   • Investigate anomalous features (e.g., Carrizozo Spring) for better understanding of unique discharge mechanisms.

6. Assessment of Pumping and Contamination:  
   • Evaluate how increased pumping of brackish water affects local and regional salinity, including risks of saline intrusion into fresher aquifers.  
   • Continue studies on potential contamination sources (e.g., military installations) and their impacts on groundwater quality.

7. Long-Term and Climate-Oriented Studies:  
   • Conduct longitudinal monitoring to track salinity changes over years, informing aquifer management under varying stressors.  
   • Examine potential impacts of climate change on precipitation patterns, recharge rates, and groundwater levels to strengthen future water resource planning.  

These recommendations collectively aim to fill data gaps, improve hydrogeological understanding, and guide sustainable management of the Tularosa Basin’s groundwater resources.
