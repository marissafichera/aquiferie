The Pliocene Ceja Formation lies on the distal hanging-wall ramp across much of the Albuquerque Basin. The Ceja onlapped and buried a widespread, Upper Mio- cene erosional paleosurface by 3.0 Ma. Sediment accumulation rates in the Ceja Formation decreased after 3.0 Ma and the Ceja formed broad sheets of amalgam- ated channel deposits that prograded into the basin after ca. 2.6 Ma. Ceja deposition ceased shortly after 1.8 Ma, forming the Llano de Albuquerque surface. Deposition of the Sierra Ladrones Formation by the ancestral Rio Grande was focused near the eastern master fault system before piedmont deposits (Sierra Ladrones Forma- tion) began prograding away from the border faults between 1.8 and 1.6 Ma. Wide- spread basin \ufb01 lling ceased when the Rio Grande began cutting its valley, shortly after 0.78 Ma. Although the Albuquerque Basin is tectonically active, the development of through-going drainage of the ancestral Rio Grande, burial of Miocene unconformi- ties, and coarsening of upper Santa Fe Group synrift basin \ufb01 ll were likely driven by Connell, S.D., Smith, G.A., Geissman, J.W., and McIntosh, W.C., 2013, Climatic controls on nonmarine depositional sequences in the Albuquerque Basin, Rio Grande rift, north-central New Mexico, in Hudson, M.R., and Grauch, V.J.S., eds., New Perspectives on Rio Grande Rift Basins: From Tectonics to Groundwater: Geological Society of America Special Paper 494, p. 383\u2013425, doi:10.1130/2013.2494(15).

INTRODUCTION Rift basins are important tectonic elements within conti- nental regions subjected to crustal extension. The stratigraphic architecture of intracontinental rift basins is de\ufb01 ned by three depositional belts associated with the basin \ufb02 oor and two sets of \ufb02 anking tributaries from the footwall uplift and on the hanging- wall ramp (Fig. 1). The distributions of these depositional belts are sensitive to several factors, including basin geometry, sub- sidence and sediment delivery rate, effective moisture, catch- ment morphology, and rock type (e.g., Fraser and DeCelles, 1992; Leeder and Jackson, 1993; Gawthorpe and Leeder, 2000; Paola, 2000). Most studies of half-graben sedimentation focused on ( footwall-derived) piedmont-slope and basin-\ufb02 oor successions that were deposited near the master fault system (Bridge and Leeder, 1979; Leeder and Gawthorpe, 1987; Blair and Bilodeau, 1988; Frostick and Reid, 1989; Mack and Seager, 1990; Heller and Paola, 1992; Paola et al., 1992; Bridge and Mackey, 1993; Leeder et al., 1996; Peakall, 1998; Peakall et al., 2000; Marr et al., 2000; Leeder and Mack, 2001; Smith et al., 2001). Quan- titative models of fault development and basin \ufb01 lling describe \ufb01 rst-order patterns in the stratigraphic architecture of rift basins (Schlische, 1991; Travis and Nunn, 1994; Contreras et al., 1997). Computational models suggest that sediments derived from the footwall block prograde into the basin as complementary tribu- tary deposits retreat up the hanging-wall block during times of diminished subsidence (Paola et al., 1992; Marr et al., 2000). Understanding sedimentation patterns in half-graben basins can be accomplished by examining the timing of progradation of transverse (tributary) deposits derived from facing structural margins. We demonstrate the utility of combined sequence- stratigraphic, sedimentologic, and geomorphologic approaches to interpreting alluvial sequences developed within \ufb02 uvially dominated intracontinental rift basins, such as the Albuquerque Basin of the Rio Grande rift, north-central New Mexico. Our pri- mary motivation is to develop a comprehensive understanding of why certain facies belts occupy different parts of a basin at dif- ferent times, with an emphasis on deposits on the distal hanging- wall ramp. This depositional belt should be sensitive to the activ- ity of the basin master fault because progressive basinward tilting (fore-tilting) of the hanging wall increases the fan-surface area and stream gradients, thereby promoting erosion of distal areas and progradation of sediment toward the master fault (Leeder and Gawthorpe, 1987). Deposits on the hanging-wall ramp also tend to be well exposed and occupy less structurally complicated climatic changes. Valley incision was approximately coeval with increased northern- hemisphere climatic cyclicity and magnitude and was also likely related to climatic changes. Asynchronous progradation of coarse-grained, margin-sourced detritus may be a consequence of basin shape, where the basinward tilting of the hanging wall promoted extensive sediment bypass of coarse-grained, margin-sourced sediment across the basin.

The basin axis contains sediments associated with internal surface drainage (\ufb02 uviolacus- trine) or through-going axial drainage (axial river) that are \ufb02 anked by sets of tributary deposits originating from the footwall (piedmont slope) and distal hanging-wall ramp. The basin-\ufb02 oor/ piedmont-slope boundary is sensitive to subsidence along the basin master fault (Leeder and Gawthorpe, 1987). Intraba- sinal faults cut the hanging-wall ramp and allow steepening of the basement (rollover) toward the basin master fault (e.g., Xiao and Suppe, 1992).

Nonmarine depositional sequences are well known from coastal settings, where changes in relative sea level dominate the stratigraphic architecture (e.g., Shanley and McCabe, 1994). Fluvial basins of the Rio Grande rift in New Mexico are more than 1500 km upstream of the coastline and are far from eustatic effects on base level. Thus, the upper limit of \ufb02 uvial deposition is controlled by changes in discharge regimes, sediment supply, and tectonism (Blum and T\u00f6rnqvist, 2000). The Albuquerque Basin of north-central New Mexico (Fig. 2) is well suited for investigation because excellent expo- sures have permitted extensive geologic mapping and biostrati- graphic, stratigraphic, and geochronologic studies (Bachman and Mehnert, 1978; Baldridge et al., 1980, 1987; Cole et al., 2007; Connell, 2004, 2008a, 2008b; Connell and Wells, 1999; Connell et al., 1998, 1999, 2000, 2001a, 2001b, 2001c, 2001d, 2002, 2005, 2007a, 2007b; Hawley, 1996; Hawley and Haase, 1992; Hawley et al., 1995; Lozinsky, 1994; Love and Connell, 2005; Love et al., 2001a, 2001b, 2001c; Lucas et al., 1993; Morgan and Lucas, 2003; Maldonado et al., 1999, 2006, 2007; Stone et al., 1998; Tedford and Barghoorn, 1999; Williams and Cole, 2007). New 40Ar/39Ar age determinations provide important temporal control for the development of a magnetic- polarity stratigraphy that re\ufb01 nes the geochronology of the Plio- Pleistocene Ceja and Sierra Ladrones Formations. Previous studies of the magnetic properties of deposits in the Rio Grande rift show that alluvial sediments are suitable for the develop- ment of a robust polarity stratigraphy (Mack et al., 1993; Ted- ford and Barghoorn, 1999; Hudson et al., 2008). Rift basins in semiarid regions, such as in southwestern North America, pro- vide an essential source of groundwater (Bartolino and Cole, 2002). As potable water becomes scarcer, more-robust models of extensional basin-\ufb01 ll architecture will aid in the management of these resources, as recently exempli\ufb01 ed in the Rio Grande rift (McAda and Barroll, 2002).

Study Area The Albuquerque Basin is part of the intracontinental Rio Grande rift, a chain of structurally and topographically linked extensional basins within a broader region of Neogene exten- sion in the western United States and northern Mexico (Bryan, 1938; Kelley, 1952, 1979; Chapin, 1971; Chapin and Cather, 1994). The basin is \ufb02 anked by the Colorado Plateau and Great Plains, and lies between the west-tilted Espa\u00f1ola and Socorro Basins (Fig. 2). The eastern \ufb02 ank abuts the rift-\ufb02 ank uplifts of the Sandia, Manzanita, and Manzano Mountains. The northwestern \ufb02 ank has little surface relief, but the rift-\ufb02 anking uplifts of the Sierra Lucero and the Ladron Mountains de\ufb01 ne the southwestern margin of the basin. The Albuquerque Basin resembles a single physiographic basin; however, the underlying geologic structure is complicated, and the basin has been segmented into a least three different sub-basins (cf. Russell and Snelson, 1994; Grauch et al., 1999), which are, from north to south: the Santo Domingo sub-basin (or basin, e.g., Smith et al., 2001), the Calabacillas sub-basin, and the Belen sub-basin. Most of the study area is within the Calabacillas sub-basin, but the study area extends into the southern part of the Santo Domingo sub-basin and the northern part of the Belen sub- basin (Fig. 2), where the basin \ufb01 ll generally dips eastward toward the Sandia, Manzanita, and Manzano Mountains. The basin has relatively low topographic relief that is punctuated by two large, longitudinal river valleys and elon- gate tablelands (Fig. 3). The Ceja del Rio Puerco is a west- facing erosional escarpment that de\ufb01 nes the eastern edge of the Rio Puerco valley (a southeastward-\ufb02 owing tributary to the Rio Grande) and the western edge of the Llano de Albuquer- que, which delineates the inter\ufb02 uve between the Rio Grande and Rio Puerco. La Ceja is a north-facing escarpment at the northern end of the Llano de Albuquerque. Other major land- forms in the Albuquerque Basin include the Hubbell bench, a structural bench along the western \ufb02 anks of the Manzanita and Manzano Mountains, and the Hagan embayment, a struc- tural reentrant at the northeastern margin of the basin (Kelley, 1977). The central part of the study area (in the Calabacillas sub-basin) is a half graben cut by numerous intrabasinal faults (Fig. 4), many of which are tectonically active and have slip rates of 0.2\u20130.01 mm/a (Machette et al., 1998). The western \ufb02 ank of the study area forms a shallowly buried structural bench (Laguna bench of Russell and Snelson, 1994) that is"

The western \ufb02 ank of the study area forms a shallowly buried structural bench (Laguna bench of Russell and Snelson, 1994) that is de\ufb01 ned by the San Ysidro and Cat Mesa fault zones and the western basin-border faults. The sedimentary \ufb01 ll and interbedded volcanic deposits of Rio Grande rift basins are collectively known as the Santa Fe Group (Fig. 5). Regionally these strata accumulated between Late Oligocene and early Pleistocene time (Kelley, 1977; Haw- ley, 1978; Gile et al., 1981, 1995; Chapin and Cather, 1994). Deposition of the Santa Fe Group ceased as a result of incision of the present valleys (Spiegel and Baldwin, 1963). In the Albuquer- que Basin, the Santa Fe Group is generally <1 km thick along the western margin, but it thickens to nearly 5 km next to the eastern structural margin (Fig. 4; Lozinsky, 1994). GEOCHRONOLOGY The stratigraphic architecture of the Albuquerque Basin is examined through physical correlation of strata and bound- ing surfaces, 40Ar/39Ar age determinations, biostratigraphy, and magnetic-polarity stratigraphy. Neogene deposits of the Albu- querque Basin yielded a rich array of biostratigraphically useful vertebrate fossil remains that have been summarized by Morgan and Lucas (2003) and Tedford et al. (2004). The Arroyo Ojito, Cerro Conejo, Popotosa, and Zia Formations contain interbed- ded volcanic material and sparse age-diagnostic fossils of Mio- cene age (Lozinsky and Tedford, 1991; Tedford and Barghoorn, 1999; Connell, 2004). The Ceja Formation locally contains fossils indicative of late Pliocene age (3.5\u20132.2 Ma). The Sierra Ladrones Formation contains early Pleistocene fossils (Lucas et al., 1993) and Pliocene lava exposed in the adjacent Socorro Basin (Machette, 1978). Numerous isotopic age determinations and tephrochronologic correlations on ash and \ufb02 uvially recycled pyroclastic rocks have been previously reported in the Albuquer- que Basin and surrounding areas (Bachman and Mehnert, 1978; Baldridge et al., 1980; Connell, 2004, 2008b; Connell et al., 1999, 2002; Smith et al., 2001; Dunbar et al., 2001; Maldonado et al., 2006, 2007; Chamberlin and McIntosh, 2007). 40Ar/39Ar Methods and Results We use 20 previously reported 40Ar/39Ar and tephrochrono- logic age determinations (Table 1) and report 58 new 40Ar/39Ar age determinations to re\ufb01 ne the ages of Upper Miocene through lower Pleistocene strata in the Albuquerque Basin (Figs. 6 and 7, Tables 2 and 3). Although some of the age determinations were informally reported on geologic maps and reports, details of the 40Ar/39Ar analyses are \ufb01 rst presented herein (Cather and Connell, 1998; Connell, 2004, 2008a, 2008b; Connell et al., 1999, 2005; Koning and Personius, 2002; Maldonado et al., 1999, 2006; Williams and Cole, 2007). Samples were analyzed at the New Mexico Geochronological Research Laboratory at the New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology in Socorro, New Mexico. Fish Canyon Tuff sanidine (28.02 Ma; Renne et al., 1998) was used as a monitor for reducing the analytical data. The previously reported age determinations in Table 1 have been adjusted to the revised standard of Renne et al. (1998). Com- plete analytical data, including age-spectra and age-probability distribution diagrams (Deino and Potts, 1992) are available in Appendix A (available on CD-ROM accompanying this volume and in the GSA Data Repository1). 1GSA Data Repository Item 2013132, Appendix A: Age determinations and Appendix B: Rock magnetic methods and results, is available at www .geosociety.org/pubs/ft2013.htm, or on request from editing@geosociety.org or Documents Secretary, GSA, P.O.

Volcanic rocks sampled for geochronology include tho- leiitic basalt, trachyandesite, dacite, rhyodacite, and rhyolite associated with hydromagmatic tuff, fallout ash and lapilli, lava \ufb02 ows, and shallow intrusive rocks (Kelley and Kudo, 1978; Dunbar et al., 2001; Maldonado et al., 2006, 2007; Connell, 2008b). The ages of 15 samples were determined by resistance-furnace incremental heating (RFIH) of groundmass concentrate or hornblende (Table 2). The ages of 43 samples containing sanidine were dated by single-crystal laser-fusion (SCLF) methods (Table 3). One sample containing plagio- clase was dated by SCLF methods. Age determinations for 18 samples (taken from volcanic fallout or lava \ufb02 ows) repre- sent emplacement or depositional ages. The remaining sam- ples taken from \ufb02 uvially recycled pyroclastic material, ranging from pumiceous sand to pebbles and cobbles of pumice and welded tuff, represent maximum ages of deposition. Six sam- ples of Miocene rocks provided maximum bounding ages for the overlying Plio-Pleistocene succession. Wherever possible the dense crystalline cores of ma\ufb01 c lava \ufb02 ows were sampled. Volcanic gravel was scraped clean of adhered sand grains at the time of collection, and interior parts of samples were collected for analysis. Llano de Albuquerque (LdA) LdA (proj.) SP (proj.)

A summary of the results is presented below. Samples were collected following modi\ufb01 cations to the approach of Lindsay et al. (1987). Eight sites were collected from the (Upper Miocene) Arroyo Ojito Formation and the (Pleisto- cene) unit of San Clemente. The sampling interval averaged ~2.3 m between sites, but varied from 0.2 m to 9.0 m in order to obtain suitable \ufb01 ne-grained sediments. Progressive, stepwise alternating-\ufb01 eld and thermal demagnetization of 6 to 11 speci- mens per site were conducted at the University of New Mexico Paleomagnetism and Rock Magnetism Laboratory in Albuquer- que, New Mexico. Principal component analysis was used to determine the least-squares best-\ufb01 t line of the characteristic component of mag- netization for each specimen (Kirschvink, 1980). Specimen data were combined using Fisher (1953) statistics to determine mean site directions (Table 4). The assignment of normal polarities for specimens was more rigorously scrutinized than for reverse polarities because of the possibility of strong viscous overprint- ing or diagenetic modi\ufb01 cation during the 0.78-Ma-long Brunhes normal-polarity chron. Sites were grouped into four classes following the approaches of Opdyke et al. (1977) and Johnson et al. (1982). Class I sites have at least three statistically signi\ufb01 cant directions from three or more independent samples and have (\u03b195) con\ufb01 dence limits less than 20\u00b0. Class II sites have three or more statistically sig- ni\ufb01 cant directions that are not signi\ufb01 cant at the 95% con\ufb01 dence level, but the polarity determination is not in doubt. Sites are class III if the con\ufb01 dence limit exceeded 35\u00b0. Class III sites have dis- persed vectors and were only used to corroborate polarity from stratigraphically adjacent class I sites. Class IV sites are de\ufb01 ned by only one accepted specimen and are also only used to cor- roborate polarity with stratigraphically adjacent class I sites. A \ufb01 fth category (class V) involved sites that contained specimens of poor quality or yielded multiple polarity interpretations and were rejected. Site mean directions typically show interpretable magnetic polarity. Mean site declination (D), inclination (I), and virtual geomagnetic pole (VGP) values are reported for class I and II sites (Appendix B). The tilt-corrected mean of"

The tilt-corrected mean of all class I sites for the Sierra Ladrones Formation (D = 0.8\u00b0, I = 53.3\u00b0, N = 15 sites; Table 5) is similar to the time- averaged inclination of the dipole \ufb01 eld and is ~11\u00b0 steeper than the tilt-corrected mean inclination of the Ceja Formation (D = 1.6\u00b0, I = 42.5\u00b0, N = 85 sites; Table 5). The shallower inclina- tion values for class I sites relative to the present-day and time- averaged dipole \ufb01 elds probably re\ufb02 ects a shallowing of inclina- tion due to sediment compaction (e.g., Sun and Kodama, 1992).

The stratigraphic nomenclature for the Santa Fe Group in the Albuquerque Basin was summarized by Connell (2004). Later re\ufb01 nements by Connell et al. (2007a, 2007b) and Con- nell (2008a) are used in this study (Fig. 5). The Santa Fe Group is locally divided into three subgroups. The lower and middle subgroups include the Arroyo Ojito, Blackshare, Cerro Conejo, Popotosa, Tanos, and Zia Formations. These Upper Oligocene through Miocene units were deposited within internally drained basins, where streams \ufb02 owed off emerging uplifts and terminated onto ephemeral and intermittent playa lakes (Chapin and Cather, 1994). The upper part of the Santa Fe Group was deposited after establishment of through-going axial drainage (by the ancestral Rio Grande) that linked adjacent basins (Machette, 1978; Gile et al., 1981; Chapin and Cather, 1994; Connell et al., 2005). These deposits include the Ceja, Cochiti, Sierra Ladrones, and Tuerto Formations. The Ceja and Sierra Ladrones Formations contain \ufb02 uvial deposits related to the development of the ancestral Rio Grande and its tributaries (Machette, 1978; Connell, 2008a). Widespread, but thin, conglomeratic sandstone commonly over- lie widespread, basin-\ufb02 anking unconformities (Connell, 2004, 2008a). Accumulations of alluvial, colluvial, and eolian sedi- ment, such as the unit of San Clemente, are preserved in local structural depressions. The geochronology of the Arroyo Ojito, Ceja, and Sierra Ladrones Formations was re\ufb01 ned through correlation of the mea- sured stratigraphic sections to the geomagnetic polarity time scale (GPTS; Gradstein et al., 2005) using dated temporal reference points that range from 9.7 to 0.1 Ma (Fig. 9, Tables 1\u20133). Twenty- three polarity intervals longer than 20 k.y. have been documented globally since the start of the Pliocene and are part of the GPTS. Nearly all of the major polarity chrons (and subchrons) in the past 4 Ma were recorded in this study.

Summary of 40Ar/39Ar age determinations (N = 46) for the Lava Creek B ash in an inset terrace of the Rio Grande (Qr), the Sierra Ladrones Formation, and a Miocene axial-river deposit (Tsa), showing mean sample ages and \u00b12\u03c3 uncertainties, and labora- tory or sample numbers (Tables 1\u20133). Refer to Figure 6 for explanation of symbols. Gray bars denote age ranges of the Tewa Group and Peralta Tuff Member of the Bearhead Rhyolite. The trachyandesite at San Acacia (SA) lies near the boundary between the Socorro and Albuquerque Basins (Chamberlin et al., 2001). Fluvially recycled clasts are grouped into zones that are younger or older than the age ranges established for the upper and lower Bandelier Tuffs.

The R\u00e9union and Cobb Mountain subchrons (<20 k.y.) were not recognized in this study. The preservation of such short-lived subchrons in an extensively channelized \ufb02 uvial environment is probably low. The absence of these subchrons is supported by estimates of Plio-Pleistocene sediment accumulation, which ranged from 22 to 33 m/m.y. (Lozinsky, 1994). These sedimentation rates would require sam- pling intervals of 0.4\u20130.7 m to capture these subchrons. Thus, the average sampling interval (see above) was likely too coarse to capture these short-lived subchrons. Miocene Deposits Exposed Miocene sections in the Albuquerque Basin con- tain alluvial, eolian, and volcaniclastic deposits of the Arroyo Ojito, Blackshare, Cerro Conejo, Cochiti, Popotosa, Tanos, and Zia Formations (Fig. 5). The Tanos and Blackshare Formations (Connell et al., 2002) are well exposed along the northeastern \ufb02 ank of the basin and in the Hagan embayment. The Lower to Middle Miocene Zia Formation is exposed along the northwest- ern \ufb02 ank of the basin (Connell, 2004). It consists of eolian and \ufb02 uviatile sandstone and mudstone that represents deposition in a predominantly eolian setting with scattered interdune ponds and streams (Tedford and Barghoorn, 1999). Fluviolacustrine depos- its of the Popotosa Formation are exposed in the southern part of the basin, and are also recognized in drill holes (Is2 on Fig. 3; Machette, 1978; Lozinsky, 1994; Cather et al., 1994; Connell et al., 2005; Maldonado et al., 1999, 2007). Popotosa mudstone has been reported in deep oil-test wells near Los Lunas and Isleta Pueblo (Lozinsky, 1994), but has not been recognized farther north in drill holes beneath Albuquerque (Hawley and Haase, 1992, section IV). The Middle Miocene Cerro Conejo Formation is exposed along the northwestern \ufb02 ank of the Albuquerque Basin, where it contains eolian and \ufb02 uvial sand and interbedded mudstone that was deposited between 14.5 and 9.5 Ma (Tedford and Barghoorn, 1999; Connell, 2008a). This unit represents a transition from the largely eolian Zia Formation to the predominantly \ufb02 uviatile Arroyo Ojito Formation (see below). The Cochiti Formation is a Miocene through lower Pleistocene succession of volcanic- bearing sandstone and conglomerate exposed along the southern \ufb02 ank of the Jemez Mountains (Smith and Lavine, 1996). The Arroyo Ojito Formation is exposed along the western \ufb02 ank of the Albuquerque Basin. It was deposited between 9.0 and 6.3 Ma by southeast-\ufb02 owing streams that originated on the Colo- rado Plateau and nearby uplifts, such as the Sierra Nacimiento (Connell et al., 1999). A widespread erosion surface called the Rincones paleosurface marks the top of the Arroyo Ojito Forma- tion (Connell, 2008a). The age of the lower part of the Arroyo Ojito Formation is determined by Upper Miocene basaltic lavas exposed near the top of the underlying Cerro Conejo Formation (Pazzaglia et al., 1998; Smith et al., 2001; Chamberlin and McIn- tosh, 2007). Basaltic lava \ufb02 ows at Chamisa Mesa and Bodega Butte, along the southern \ufb02 ank of the Jemez Mountains (Fig. 3), yielded groundmass 40Ar/39Ar age determinations ranging between 9.67 and 9.04 Ma (Fig. 6, sample 14, Table 1; sample 29, Table 2). Other age control for the Arroyo Ojito Formation comes from the Rio Puerco valley, where a basaltic lava \ufb02 ow at La Mesita Negra (Fig. 10) is interbedded with sandstone of the Navajo Draw Member. This \ufb02 ow yielded a 40Ar/39Ar age determi- nation of 8.16 \u00b1 0.05 Ma (Fig. 6, sample 13, Table 1; Maldonado et al., 2006). A dacitic volcanic vent at Cerro Colorado, ~3 km southeast of La Mesita Negra, yielded an age determination of 7.16 \u00b1 0.47 Ma (Fig. 6, sample 72, Table 3). The basal edges of this feature rest on Navajo Draw sandstone, ~43\u201355 m below the Rincones paleosurface of Connell (2008a). The Loma Barbon Member of the Arroyo Ojito Formation contains ashes that range in age from 6.83 to 7.06 Ma (Fig. 6, samples 10\u201312, Table 1; samples 69\u201371, Table 3). These ashes correlate to the Peralta Tuff Member of the Bearhead Rhyolite (e.g., Smith, 2001), which inter\ufb01 ngers with the Arroyo Ojito Formation and lower parts of the Cochiti Formation in the northern part of the Albuquerque Basin and southeastern \ufb02 ank of the Jemez Mountains. The Arroyo Ojito Formation generally coarsens up-section of older (7.1\u20136.8 Ma) Peralta ashes (Connell, 2008b), culminat- ing in deposition of the conglomeratic Picuda Peak Member by ca. 6.3 Ma. Lozinsky and Tedford (1991) reported an upward- coarsening trend in a 7\u20139 Ma section for piedmont deposits of the Popotosa Formation in the Gabaldon badlands, just southwest of the study area (Fig. 3). A maximum age of the top of the Arroyo Ojito Formation comes from a basaltic cobble ~20 m below the top of the Picuda Peak Member that yielded a groundmass 40Ar/39Ar age determination of 6.56 \u00b1 0.33 Ma (Fig. 6, sample 28, Table 2).

An important age determination for the Miocene suc- cession comes from a bed of rhyolitic pumice in the Cochiti Formation exposed along the northern \ufb02 ank of the San Felipe volcanic \ufb01 eld (Fig. 11). This pumice yielded a 40Ar/39Ar age determination on sanidine of 6.29 \u00b1 0.08 Ma (Fig. 6, sample 10, Table 1) that correlates to the Cerrito Yelo tephra of the Per- alta Tuff (Chamberlin and McIntosh, 2007). It is ~20 m below the 2.46\u20132.43 Ma basaltic lavas of the San Felipe volcanic \ufb01 eld (Figs. 6 and 7, samples 5 and 6, Table 1; samples 16\u201319, Table 2; Smith et al., 2001). The age of this tephra suggests the presence of an unconformity or condensed stratigraphic section between Upper Miocene and upper Pliocene rocks (Fig. 11). Geologic mapping north of the San Felipe volcanic \ufb01 eld did not recognize any widespread unconformities within the Cochiti Formation (Smith et al., 2001); however, other workers reported multiple Miocene unconformities toward the western margin of the basin (Chamberlin and McIntosh, 2007).

Ceja Formation The Ceja Formation contains \ufb02 uvial sandstone, conglomer- ate, and mudstone deposited by large southeast-\ufb02 owing streams and \ufb02 uvial fans that drained the southeastern Colorado Plateau, San Juan Basin, Sierra Nacimiento, and southern Jemez Moun- tains (Connell, 2008a). Streams of the Ceja Formation drained roughly the same region as those of the Arroyo Ojito Formation; however, the Ceja Formation contains a greater variety of rock types than the Arroyo Ojito Formation and represents deeper unroo\ufb01 ng of the western \ufb02 anks of the Albuquerque Basin (Con- nell et al., 1999). The Ceja Formation thickens to the east (from ~20 m to over 420 m) and is bounded by a basal erosional surface called Rincones paleosurface, and an upper relict depositional surface called the Llano de Albuquerque surface (see below). The Ceja Formation is divided into the Santa Ana Mesa, Atrisco, and Rio Puerco Members (Fig. 5). The Atrisco and Santa Ana Mesa Members contain sandstone and mudstone with minor pebbly sandstone interbeds. The Atrisco Member contains thickly bedded, mottled and massive to well-sorted, \ufb01 ne-grained, eolian sand (Figs. 12A and 12D). The Santa Ana Mesa Mem- ber is generally redder in color and contains coarser gravel than the Atrisco Member. The Rio Puerco Member is dominated by coarse-grained, medium to very thickly bedded, pebbly to cob- bly sand with scattered cobbles and small boulders. The con- tact between the Atrisco and Rio Puerco Members is sharp and erosional along the Ceja del Rio Puerco. Gravelly beds in the Rio Puerco Member form overlapping, laterally and vertically stacked channels that commonly contain laminated to thinly bed- ded, low-angle, planar and locally trough cross-strati\ufb01 ed sand and pebbly sand (Fig. 12B). The Ceja Formation generally coarsens up-section, culmi- nating in mesa-capping gravels of the Rio Puerco Member, and contains a nearly 2-m-thick accumulation of petrocalcic soils of the Llano de Albuquerque surface (Fig. 12A). Using borehole geophysical logs, Connell et al. (1998) interpreted an overall upward-coarsening trend in deposits overlying the Atrisco Mem- ber. This coarsening trend in the Ceja Formation was con\ufb01 rmed here by measuring the relative proportions of mud, sand, and gravel sizes along the Ceja del Rio Puerco and at El Cerro de los Lunas, or Los Lunas volcano (Fig. 3). Mudstone (12%\u201324% of the section) and sandstone (72%\u201381%) beds dominate the Atrisco Member along the Ceja del Rio Puerco, but gravels are a minor constituent (4%\u20137%). The overlying Rio Puerco Member is dominated by gravel (35%\u201348%) and sand (49%\u201359%) with minor mud beds (3%\u20136%). The upward-coarsening trend in the Ceja Formation is also re\ufb02 ected by gravel size. The lower part of the Atrisco Member contain medium pebbles (7 \u00b1 3 cm, mean intermediate diame- ter of 5 \u00b1 2 cm, N = 67 measurements), whereas the upper part contains medium to coarse pebbles (17 \u00b1 4 cm, mean intermedi- ate diameter of 11 \u00b1 3 cm, N = 26). The Rio Puerco Member contains coarse pebbles (21 \u00b1 9 cm, mean intermediate diameter of 15 \u00b1 6 cm, N = 42). Very coarse pebbles and coarse cobbles (40\u2013110 cm in maximum diameter) are scattered at the top of the Rio Puerco Member. Geochronology Lava \ufb02 ows and \ufb02 uvially recycled volcanic gravel in the Ceja Formation demonstrate a Pliocene age of deposition (Connell, 2008a; Maldonado et al., 2007). The age of the Ceja Formation is re\ufb01 ned by integrating isotopic and biostratigraphic age data into \ufb01 ve composite stratigraphic sections that were sampled for magnetic polarity: CDRP3, CDRP-CL, CSA-PLU, LLV, and ZF (Figs. 13\u201315, 17, 19, and 20; locations shown in Fig. 3). The age of the base of the Atrisco Member increases into the basin across numerous intrabasinal normal faults (Fig. 9). The 3.02 Ma Cat Mesa lava \ufb02 ow marks the base of the Atrisco Member on Cat Mesa and along the Ceja del Rio Puerco (Fig. 6, sample 7, Table 1). A volcanic ash adjacent to the Zia fault at La Ceja in the ZF section (Fig. 15) was geochemically correlated to the ca. 3.28 Ma Nomlaki Tuff (sample 8, Table 1). This ash yielded a reverse-polarity magnetization that is consistent with polarity data for the Nomlaki Tuff (Reheis et al., 1991). The Atrisco Member at CDRP3 and CDRP-CL contains normal- and reverse-polarity sites (Figs. 13 and 14) that indi- cate deposition during parts of the Gauss and Matuyama chrons (Fig. 9). The Santa Ana Mesa Member is locally capped by basal- tic lavas of the San Felipe volcanic \ufb01 eld (at Santa Ana Mesa), which yielded groundmass 40Ar/39Ar age determinations of 2.57 \u00b1 0.11 Ma and 1.85 \u00b1 0.10 Ma (Fig. 7, samples 19 and 16, Table 2). The Santa Ana Mesa Member contains an ash exposed in the spillway of the Jemez River dam that is ~42 m below these Pliocene basaltic lavas (Fig. 11). This spillway ash yielded a single-crystal 40Ar/39Ar age determination on hornblende of 3.81 \u00b1 0.23 Ma (Fig. 6, sample 25, Table 2). The thickest, most complete and accessible exposures of the Ceja Formation in the study area are along the \ufb02 anks of El Cerro de los Lunas, also called Los Lunas volcano (Fig. 16; Kel- ley and Kudo, 1978; Love et al., 1998; Maldonado et al., 2007). A 210-m-thick composite stratigraphic section was assembled by correlating distinctive marker beds and an angular unconformity (Fig. 17). El Cerro de los Lunas contains two overlapping trachy- andesitic volcanoes that yielded groundmass 40Ar/39Ar age deter- minations of 3.83 \u00b1 0.10 Ma and 1.26 \u00b1 0.02 Ma (Fig. 6, samples 3 and 4, Table 1; Dunbar et al., 2001).

The abrupt change in the character of this stratal discontinuity and doming around the volcanoes suggest that this contact formed during emplacement of the older vol- cano, rather than representing a buried correlative of the Rinco- nes paleosurface. Strata underlying the older lava \ufb02 ow yielded reverse polarity directions that are consistent with deposition during the later part of the Gilbert polarity chron, and after the normal polarity Cochiti subchron, at 4.187 Ma (Fig. 9). The top of the Ceja section contains a buried paleosol that is considered to be a buried correlative of the Llano de Albuquerque surface (Figs. 8 and 17). A bed of angular volcanic lapilli and blocks in the unit of San Clemente was deposited during the younger Los Lunas eruption. The easternmost exposures of the Ceja Formation were examined in faulted blocks exposed along the \ufb02 anks of the Rio Grande valley (Fig. 18). Basaltic cinders from Perea Mesa (Isleta volcano, Kelley and Kudo, 1978) are exposed along the eastern edge of the Rio Grande valley (Fig. 6, samples 21\u201323, Table 2), ~4 km northwest of Isleta Pueblo (Fig. 3). These 2.8\u20132.9 Ma basaltic tephra are stratigraphically below the CSU-PLU measured sections (Figs. 18 and 19; Connell et al., 2001d, their \ufb01 gure 2-1). Gray dacitic pumice pebbles, scat- tered throughout much of the Ceja Formation, yielded 40Ar/39Ar age determinations of 2.63\u20132.77 Ma (Fig. 6, samples 65\u201367, Table 3). These maximum ages support correlation of the lower part of the CSA-PLU section to the upper Gauss and Matuyama chrons (Fig. 9). The Rio Puerco Member at CDRP3 and CDRP-CL contains a normal-polarity interval that is interpreted as part of the 1.945\u2013 1.778 Ma Olduvai subchron (Fig. 9). This interval is <10 m in thickness and probably did not record the geologically short (<10 k.y.) R\u00e9union subchron.

Assignment of thin, reverse-polarity intervals in the CDRP- CL, LLV, and CSA-PLU sections to GPTS subchrons are ambigu- ous because of a lack of adequate age control. Two thin (<4.5 m), reverse-polarity magnetozones at CDRP-CL may represent the Matuyama chron, or the Mammoth or Kaena subchrons. A 4.5-m-thick succession of sand and laminated silty sand in the Atrisco Member is disconformably overlain by the Rio Puerco Member at CDRP-CL. The estimated site mean direction (D = 233\u00b0; I = \u221211\u00b0; VGP latitude = \u221233\u00b0) supports a reverse-polarity interpretation, and the stratigraphic position of this site (below the Rio Puerco Member) supports assignment to the lower part of the Matuyama chron. Thus, this stratigraphically lower reverse- polarity magnetozone (site 11) records either the Mammoth or Kaena subchrons. Assignment to the Kaena subchron is preferred because of the structurally higher position of the CDRP-CL sec- tion (on the footwall of the San Ysidro fault) and similar strati- graphic position relative to the Cat Mesa \ufb02 ow (CM-1, Fig. 9). Assignment of a thin, reverse-polarity magnetozone in the LLV and CSA-PLU composite sections (Figs. 17 and 19) to the Kaena subchron is based on the presence of dacitic pumice pebbles. Although dacitic pebbles in the LLV section did not yield inter- pretable age determinations, similar volcanic pebbles in CDRP3 and CSA-PLU yielded age determinations that are younger than the 3.3\u20133.2 Ma Mammoth subchron.

Much of the Sierra Ladrones Formation is poorly exposed in the study area, but it is as much as 580 m thick in wells beneath Albuquer- que (Hawley et al., 1995; Connell et al., 1998). The Sierra Ladrones Formation is informally divided into two inter\ufb01 ngering members (Fig. 5; Machette, 1978): an axial- \ufb02 uvial member (the ancestral Rio Grande), and a piedmont-slope member associated with tributary drainages from the rift-\ufb02 anking uplifts. The axial-\ufb02 uvial member contains trough cross-strati\ufb01 ed sand and gravel with sparse muddy interbeds representing ances- tral Rio Grande deposition (Fig. 12E). Sand and gravel typically form in a 5- to 14-km-wide depositional belt that, in the study area, lies almost entirely east of the present Rio Grande valley. The eastern edge of this depositional belt is 1\u20135 km west of the Hubbell bench and the basin-bordering Sandia Mountains (Con- nell, 2008b; Maldonado et al., 2007). The top of the Sierra Ladrones Formation is marked by pedogenically modi\ufb01 ed depositional tops of the Ca\u00f1ada Colo- rada, Las Huertas, Llano de Manzano, and Sunport geomor- phic surfaces (described below).

The uppermost part of the pied- mont-member forms a coarse-grained wedge of sediment that prograded (west) into the basin by 5\u201320 km, where it buried axial-\ufb02 uvial deposits of the ancestral Rio Grande (Figs. 11, 12F, 18, and 20; Connell et al., 2001c, 2001d). Gravels of the axial- \ufb02 uvial member coarsen stratigraphically above the lavas of the San Felipe volcanic \ufb01 eld (Brandes, 2002). Water-supply wells in Albuquerque show a coarsening of the axial-\ufb02 uvial member in the upper 317 m of the section (Ch5, Figs. 3 and 4; Hawley, 1996; Connell, 2006, 2008b). This coarsening also re\ufb02 ects the progra- dation of basin-margin alluvial fans and alluvial slopes over the axial-river deposits. Geochronology The Sierra Ladrones Formation is generally considered to range from Pliocene to early Pleistocene in age (4.7\u20130.8 Ma; Figs. 6 and 9); however, Late Miocene age determinations have been reported for axial-\ufb02 uvial deposits in the northern part of the basin (Smith et al., 2001). Volcanic-bearing \ufb02 uvial deposits of possible extrabasinal origin have been reported beneath the Atrisco Member of the Ceja Formation in water-supply wells beneath Albuquerque (Hawley and Haase, 1992, section IV). Pliocene lava \ufb02 ows of the San Felipe volcanic \ufb01 eld are interbed- ded with axial-\ufb02 uvial deposits (2.57 \u00b1 0.11 Ma; Fig. 7, sample 19, Table 2). To the south, Pliocene-aged trachyandesitic lava lies above the projected base of the Sierra Ladrones Formation at San Acacia (Machette, 1978), ~60 km south of the study area. Cham- berlin et al. (2001) reported a 40Ar/39Ar age determination of 4.76 \u00b1 0.04 Ma for this volcanic feature (Fig. 7, sample SA, Table 1). The top of the Sierra Ladrones Formation is well exposed at the mouth of Tijeras Arroyo (Figs. 18 and 20), where axial-\ufb02 uvial deposits contain an early Pleistocene \ufb02 ora and vertebrate fauna that is older than ca. 0.8 Ma (Lucas et al., 1993; Morgan and Lucas, 2003; Bell et al., 2004). The axial-\ufb02 uvial member con- tains abundant \ufb02 uvially recycled, rhyolitic pumice and rounded obsidian pebbles and cobbles, some of which were dated or geo- chemically correlated to known eruptive sources (Fig. 7; Love et al., 2001a; Maldonado et al., 1999, 2007). These pumice-bearing beds were likely laid down by \ufb02 oods originating in the Jemez Mountains, where voluminous rhyolitic volcanism and river damming has occurred (e.g., Smith et al., 1970; Reneau and Dethier, 1996). Pumice-bearing Plio-Pleistocene \ufb02 ood deposits have also been reported in ancestral Rio Grande deposits nearly 300 km downstream of Tijeras Arroyo (Mack et al., 1996). A bed of white volcanic ash (1.28 \u00b1 0.2 Ma; Fig. 7, sample 33, Table 3) has been geochemically correlated with the Tshirege Member of the Bandelier Tuff (Nelia Dunbar, 2001, personal commun.). Beneath this ash lies a bed of nearly pure, medium- grained, gray and white, pumiceous sand that yielded a single- crystal 40Ar/39Ar age determination on sanidine of 2.00 \u00b1 0.04 Ma (Fig. 7, sample 63, Table 3). This lower pumiceous interval lies within a normal-polarity magnetozone that is nearly 14 m strati- graphically below the Tshirege ash (Fig. 20) and is assigned to part of the 1.945\u20131.778 Ma Olduvai subchron (Fig. 9). The pres- ence of the Olduvai subchron demonstrates that deposition in the upper part of the Ceja Formation was contemporaneous with the axial-\ufb02 uvial member of the Sierra Ladrones Formation, even though they are separated by a disconformity exposed along the \ufb02 anks of the Rio Grande valley (Fig. 8). The age of the top of the Sierra Ladrones Formation comes from the CSA-PLU composite section (Fig. 19), between Tijeras Arroyo and Hell Canyon Wash (Fig. 18). The upper part of this section contains 1.44\u20131.67 Ma rhyolitic and pumiceous gravel (Fig. 7, e.g., samples 15 and 64, Tables 2 and 3). Deposits of the axial-\ufb02 uvial member are exposed in Hell Canyon Wash (Fig. 18), where rhyolitic, pumice-bearing \ufb02 uvial cobbles yielded an 40Ar/39Ar age determination on sanidine of 1.72 \u00b1 0.04 Ma (Fig. 7, sample 58, Table 3). An olive-green and reddish-brown sequence of mudstone, locally preserved against an intrabasinal fault, caps the Sierra Ladrones axial-\ufb02 uvial succession at section PLU (Fig. 19). These mudstone beds contain a normal-polarity magnetozone that cor- relate to the early part of the Brunhes chron (0.781 Ma to present; Gradstein et al., 2005). A terrace deposit containing the 0.64 Ma Lava Creek B ash is inset (~60 m) below the top of the Sierra Ladrones Formation (Fig. 18; Connell et al., 2007a). Thus, depo- sition of the Sierra Ladrones Formation ended with the entrench- ment of the Rio Grande valley, which occurred shortly after 0.78 Ma and was well under way by 0.64 Ma. Few direct age determinations are available for the piedmont member of the Sierra Ladrones Formation. Just south of Tonque Arroyo (Fig. 11), a volcanic ash bed sits 3 m above the piedmont/ axial-\ufb02 uvial contact (Cather and Connell, 1998; Brandes, 2002). This ash yielded single-crystal 40Ar/39Ar age determinations on sanidine of 1.57 \u00b1 0.09 Ma and 1.60 \u00b1 0.06 Ma (Fig. 7, samples 51 and 52, Table 3). Piedmont-member deposits prograded by as much as 10 km toward the Rio Grande after 1.7\u20131.6 Ma and bur- ied most of the axial-\ufb02 uvial member deposits (Figs. 11 and 18). Plio-Pleistocene Deposits Gravelly deposits exposed along the faulted and structur- ally elevated \ufb02 anks of the Albuquerque Basin are inset against Miocene basin \ufb01 ll and older parts of the Ceja and Sierra Ladrones Formations (e.g., Connell and Wells, 1999; Smith et al., 2001). The Tuerto Formation (Tuerto gravels of Stearns, 1953) is a thin and areally extensive, subhorizontally bedded succession of gravel and sand on the northern \ufb02 ank of the San- dia Mountains and in the Hagan embayment that overlies an angular unconformity marked by the lower Ortiz paleosurface (see below). The Tuerto Formation is dominated by amalga- mated conglomeratic sandstone (Koning et al., 2001) that locally encloses basaltic lava \ufb02 ows of the Pliocene Cerros del Rio volcanic \ufb01 eld near the boundary between the Albuquerque and Espa\u00f1ola Basins.

(1998) for deposits of sand, mud, and gravel that overlie the Ceja Formation in structural depressions on the Llano de Albuquerque (Fig. 16). The unit of San Clemente is ~36 m thick and discon- formably overlies the Llano de Albuquerque surface (Fig. 17; Connell et al., 2001c). The top of this section is marked by well- developed calcic paleosols that are locally capped by lava \ufb02 ows of the middle Pleistocene Cat Hills volcanic \ufb01 eld (99\u2013111 ka; Kelley and Kudo, 1978; Maldonado et al., 2006, 2007). Sparse gravel in this unit typically resembles that of the underlying Ceja Formation, except for a nearly 3-m-thick lens of cross-strati\ufb01 ed, pumice-bearing pebbly sand ~22 m above the westward projec- tion of the Llano de Albuquerque surface (Fig. 8 and Fig. 16 bot- tom). Rhyolitic pumice pebbles in this interval yielded a maxi- mum age of 1.24 \u00b1 0.02 Ma (Fig. 7, sample 32, Table 3) and are geochemically similar to the Tshirege Member of the Bandelier Tuff (N. Dunbar, 2001, personal commun.). The most likely source of this pumice-bearing bed was the ancestral Rio Grande. Sediment-Accumulation Rates Rates of sediment accumulation were estimated for parts of the Ceja and Sierra Ladrones succession using the measured stratigraphic sections, data from a deep water-supply well in Albuquerque (Ch5, Fig. 3), and available age control (Fig. 21).

Truncation of magnetozones by disconformities would result in higher estimated rates. Accumulation rates for measured sec- tions thinner than 60 m were adjusted for compaction using the approximation method of Van Hinte (1978) and porosity-depth relationships from Albuquerque area wells (Haneberg, 1995). The thicker section in the well was decompacted by applying an integral method described in Angevine et al. (1990) to the porosity-depth curves of Haneberg (1995). On the basis of sparse age control, Lozinsky (1994) reported undecompacted sediment accumulation rates of 200\u2013600 m/m.y. for Miocene strata, although his highest estimated rates are prob- ably much lower than ours (Fig. 21A; Connell, 2004). The type section of the Arroyo Ojito Formation is 478 m thick (Connell et al., 1999) and accumulated between 9.0 and 6.3 Ma, yielding a long-term (undecompacted) accumulation rate of ~177 m/m.y. (478 m/2.7 m.y.). At the Arroyo Ojito type area, a 6.85 Ma ash is 328 m above the base, and ~150 m below the top (Connell et al., 1999; Connell, 2008a). This ash and the 9 Ma estimated age of the base of the Arroyo Ojito Formation yield an undecompacted rate of ~153 m/m.y. (328 m/2.15 m.y.). The stratigraphic interval between the Peralta ashes and the assumed 6.3 Ma upper estimate for the Arroyo Ojito Formation yields a higher undecompacted rate of ~252 m/m.y. (151 m/0.6 m.y.). A slower rate of accumula- tion for the Picuda Peak Member (20 m/0.31 m.y. = 65 m/m.y.) was estimated using the ages of the 6.6 Ma basaltic cobble in the Picuda Peak Member and the 6.3 Ma Cerrito Yelo ash, which is interbedded within the Cochiti Formation. Plio-Pleistocene accumulation rates were estimated using age determinations and magnetic-polarity stratigraphy (Figs. 21B\u201321C). Compaction errors in the Los Lunas volcano sections were negligible in the upper 60 m (post\u20133.0 Ma) of the LLV section. The lower part of this section was adjusted for com- paction, yielding rates that were a factor of 1.2\u20131.4 higher than the undecompacted rates. An undecompacted rate between the older and younger Los Lunas eruptive products was ~32 m/m.y., which is similar to sedimentation rates determined by Lozinsky (1994) and to rates reported for comparably aged rift-basin \ufb01 ll in southern New Mexico (Mack et al., 1993). The absence of a normal-polarity magnetozone in the Gil- bert-aged part of the LLVS (Fig. 17) suggests that deposition occurred after the Cochiti subchron (C3n.1n, Fig. 9) at 4.187 Ma. This age constraint resulted in a decompacted rate 100 m/m.y. (undecompacted rate of 66 m/m.y.). Decompacted accumulation rates ranged from 168 to 183 m/m.y. between 3.8 and 3.0 Ma (undecompacted rate of 114\u2013155 m/m.y. for the same time inter- val). Accumulation rates in the Ceja Formation decreased by ~66% between 3.8 and 3.0 Ma, and by ~80% (59\u201312 m/m.y.) between 3.0 and 1.8 Ma (Fig. 21). Miscorrelation of the Kaena (or Mammoth) subchron would only result in decreasing accu- mulation rates after 3.3 Ma, rather than after 3.0 Ma. Accumulation rates for the CDRP3, CDRP-CL, CSA- PLU, TA, and SC-1 sections demonstrate an overall decrease in the rate of sediment accumulation by a factor of three or four since 3.0 Ma (12\u201359 m/m.y.) and are similar to the rates esti- mated for the Ceja Formation in the Los Lunas volcano sections (Figs. 21B\u201321C). This decrease in sedimentation rate occurred nearly 0.45 m.y. before the Ceja section became much coarser grained (in the Rio Puerco Member). Decreases in sedimentation rates after 3 Ma were punctuated by short intervals of relatively rapid accumulation in gravelly beds in CDRP3 and CDRP-CL. These faster rates may be the result of rapid deposition by river channels or they may merely be an artifact of shorter sampling and time intervals (Sadler, 1981). Accumulation rates estimated for the Sierra Ladrones Formation at the CSA-PLU and TA sec- tions range from 12 to 43 m/m.y. (Fig. 21C) and are in general agreement with estimates by Lozinsky (1994). The Charles Wells #5 well (Ch5) penetrated the base of the Atrisco Member (at 872 m below land surface; Connell et al., 1998) near its deepest known level in the basin. Although the top of the Sierra Ladrones Formation is not preserved in this well, the top of this well is <27 m below the projection of the Sunport surface (Connell, 2008b). Thus, Ch5 contains the thickest known accumulation of Sierra Ladrones deposits in the Albuquerque Basin. A decompacted sediment thickness for this entire succes- sion is 917 m, and"

Accumulation rates for the CDRP3, CDRP-CL, CSA- PLU, TA, and SC-1 sections demonstrate an overall decrease in the rate of sediment accumulation by a factor of three or four since 3.0 Ma (12\u201359 m/m.y.) and are similar to the rates esti- mated for the Ceja Formation in the Los Lunas volcano sections (Figs. 21B\u201321C). This decrease in sedimentation rate occurred nearly 0.45 m.y. before the Ceja section became much coarser grained (in the Rio Puerco Member). Decreases in sedimentation rates after 3 Ma were punctuated by short intervals of relatively rapid accumulation in gravelly beds in CDRP3 and CDRP-CL. These faster rates may be the result of rapid deposition by river channels or they may merely be an artifact of shorter sampling and time intervals (Sadler, 1981). Accumulation rates estimated for the Sierra Ladrones Formation at the CSA-PLU and TA sec- tions range from 12 to 43 m/m.y. (Fig. 21C) and are in general agreement with estimates by Lozinsky (1994). The Charles Wells #5 well (Ch5) penetrated the base of the Atrisco Member (at 872 m below land surface; Connell et al., 1998) near its deepest known level in the basin. Although the top of the Sierra Ladrones Formation is not preserved in this well, the top of this well is <27 m below the projection of the Sunport surface (Connell, 2008b). Thus, Ch5 contains the thickest known accumulation of Sierra Ladrones deposits in the Albuquerque Basin. A decompacted sediment thickness for this entire succes- sion is 917 m, and yields an average sediment accumulation rate of 167 or 229 m/m.y. (Fig. 21A), depending on the ages selected for the base (i.e., 6.3\u20130.8 Ma or 4.8\u20130.8 Ma); undecompacted rates are 158 or 218 m/m.y. Higher accumulation rates would result if the Sierra Ladrones succession was younger than 4.8 Ma near the well. These long-term rates are greater than those deter- mined for the measured sections, which are 12\u201330 km away from the master fault. The lower rates estimated toward the western basin margin may be a result of reduced accommodation up the hanging-wall ramp in this part of the basin. PALEOSURFACES The Plio-Pleistocene alluvial succession in the Albuquer- que Basin is de\ufb01 ned by a set of bounding surfaces (Fig. 22). The lower boundary is de\ufb01 ned by the Rincones and lower Ortiz paleosurfaces. The upper boundaries are locally de\ufb01 ned by a set of depositional (constructional) geomorphic surfaces devel- oped on the Ceja, Sierra Ladrones, and Tuerto Formations. The Rincones paleosurface was named by for a disconformity between Miocene and Pliocene deposits in the western part of the Albuquerque Basin (Connell, 2008a). This discontinu- ity is exposed beneath the Ceja Formation, along the west- ern and northern \ufb02 anks of the Llano de Albuquerque and La Ceja, where as much of 450 m of the subjacent Miocene strata is missing. It is commonly disconformable (but forms angu- lar unconformities near major intrabasinal faults), and locally contains strongly developed petrocalcic paleosols that exhibit stage III+ and V pedogenic carbonate morphology, depending on structural position. Elsewhere this boundary is marked by a pinkish, mottled, and bioturbated sand with scattered pebbles (e.g., Fig. 13).

Bryan and co-workers (Bryan and McCann, 1938; Wright, 1946; Stearns, 1979) considered the Ortiz paleosurface to represent a regional surface of erosion that divided moderately deformed Miocene strata from less-deformed Plio-Pleistocene strata. The subjacent Miocene strata were tilted by as much as 32\u00b0 and were sub- jected to several hundred meters of erosion before being buried by subhorizontally bedded Plio-Pleistocene \ufb02 uvial deposits of the Tuerto and Ancha Formations (Stearns, 1953; Koning et al., 2002; Connell et al., 2002). The Ortiz paleosurface was extended across the Albuquerque Basin and onto the eastern \ufb02 ank of the Colorado Plateau and was correlated to the Llano de Albuquer- que surface (Bryan and McCann, 1938; Wright, 1946; Kelley, 1977; Stearns, 1979). Bachman and Mehnert (1978) recognized the compound (and allostratigraphic) character of the Ortiz paleosurface, but restricted it to the upper aggradational surface on the Tuerto For- mation in the Hagan embayment (Koning et al., 2001), and on the Ancha Formation in the adjacent Espa\u00f1ola Basin (Koning et al., 2002). This division was challenged by Stearns (1979) who considered the lower surface to be more useful as a boundary between tilted Miocene rocks and the overlying subhorizontally bedded Plio-Pleistocene sediment. We also consider the erosional aspect of the lower paleosurface to have regional importance and correlate it to the Rincones paleosurface; however, we assign the relict depositional top of the Ceja Formation to the younger Llano de Albuquerque surface (see below). The Rincones and lower Ortiz paleosurfaces are recognized along the \ufb02 anks of the Albuquerque Basin, and represent essen- tially the same lacuna (Fig. 22). The character of these paleosur- faces in depocentral areas is not clear. Drill-hole data indicate that the stratigraphic correlatives to the Rincones paleosurface in dep- ocentral areas form a rather sharp boundary (Connell et al., 1998; Stone et al., 1998).

The Llano de Albuquerque surface represents the deposi- tional top of the Ceja Formation (Machette, 1985). The Llano de Albuquerque landform is a 106-km-long, south-sloping table- land between the Rio Grande and Rio Puerco valleys that is 110\u2013 494 m above the Rio Grande. Petrocalcic paleosols developed on this relict depositional surface commonly possess stage III+ to IV pedogenic carbonate morphology and are thicker than those developed on the Sierra Ladrones Formation (Machette, 1985; Connell, 2008a; Connell and Wells, 1999). The sharp contact between the Sierra Ladrones and Ceja Formations exposed along the eastern \ufb02 ank of the Rio Grande valley likely represents an eroded remnant of this surface (Fig. 18). The Ca\u00f1ada Colorada, Las Huertas, Sunport, and Llano de Manzano geomorphic surfaces de\ufb01 ne local tops of the Sierra Ladrones Formation and parts of the younger piedmont alluvium (Lambert, 1968; Machette, 1985; Maldonado et al., 1999; Con- nell and Wells, 1999; Connell, 2004). The Ca\u00f1ada Colorada sur- face developed on a faulted block on the northern Hubbell bench (Maldonado et al., 1999). The other surfaces are 95\u2013120 m above the Rio Grande and serve as useful stratigraphic datum planes to correlate depositional tops of the Sierra Ladrones Formation. Pet- rocalcic paleosols on the Ca\u00f1ada Colorada surface (stage III+ to V; Connell et al., 2001c) are more strongly developed than those on the Las Huertas, Llano de Manzano, and Sunport surfaces (stage III+; Machette, 1985; Connell and Wells, 1999), suggest- ing that it may be much older than these other surfaces. Isolated, high-level, relict surfaces are preserved on remnants of locally derived alluvium on the northern \ufb02 ank of the Sandia Mountains (Connell and Wells, 1999; Connell, 2008b). These surfaces have erosionally modi\ufb01 ed petrocalcic soils (stage IV+ pedogenic car- bonate morphology) and may represent older surfaces of the Tuerto Formation. ALLUVIAL SEQUENCES The Ceja and Sierra Ladrones Formations form a basin- wide, nonmarine depositional sequence that is de\ufb01 ned by dis- tinct sets of bounding surfaces (Fig. 22). The lower bounding surface, de\ufb01 ned by the Rincones and lower Ortiz paleosurfaces, contains strongly developed paleosols that indicate that large parts of the basin were subjected to prolonged periods of land- scape stability (105\u2013106 years; Machette, 1985) before being buried by the Ceja Formation. Although the these paleosurfaces are areally extensive, the lack of an obvious unconformable boundary in the piedmont succession near the basin master fault (along the northern \ufb02 ank of the Sandia Mountains) sug- gests that sedimentation continued essentially uninterrupted in the deeper parts of the basin. The upper boundaries of this alluvial sequence are de\ufb01 ned by a suite of relict depositional surfaces (i.e., Ca\u00f1ada Colorada, Llano de Albuquerque, Las Huertas, Sunport, and Llano de Man- zano) that contain strongly developed paleosols. Depositional onlap and intrabasinal faulting increased the duration of strati- graphic lacunae toward the basin margins (Fig. 22). Deep inci- sion by younger alluvium associated with episodic cutting by the Rio Grande (and major tributaries) also de\ufb01 nes the upper bound- ary of this sequence. Miocene Sedimentation Middle to Upper Miocene strata exposed in the northern part of the Albuquerque Basin are dominated by \ufb02 uvial and eolian deposits of the Cerro Conejo Formation (Fig. 23A). The east- ward (basinward) slope of the Rincones paleosurface, generally consistent eastward to southeastward stratal tilt directions, east- ward thickening of the basin \ufb01 ll, southeast-directed paleo\ufb02 ow directions, and western-margin (i.e., Colorado Plateau\u2013Sierra Nacimiento) gravel provenance (Brandes, 2002; Connell, 2004; Connell, 2008a, 2008b) all indicate that the study area has been dominated by generally eastward basin subsidence, and has not been subjected to any major changes in the direction of basin tilt- ing since Early Miocene time (cf. Ingersoll, 2001). Movement along the basin-master fault system increased after ca. 9 Ma, resulting in continued eastward tilting and thick- ening of the Arroyo Ojito Formation (Fig. 23B). The northern part of the Albuquerque Basin received extrabasinal sediments as early 7 Ma, but the southern part of the basin was dominated by internal surface drainage until early Pliocene time (Figs. 23B\u2013 23C).

Deposition of the Arroyo Ojito Formation ceased shortly after ca. 6.3 Ma with the development of the Rincones paleo- surface (Fig. 23B). During Late Miocene time, the underlying \ufb02 uviatile succession was subjected to ~0.5 km of erosion across the western (up-dip) margin of the basin (Figs. 23B\u201323C). Workers in the adjacent Socorro and Espa\u00f1ola Basins reported an overall reduction in the rate of deformation after ca. 10 Ma (Cather et al., 1994; Koning et al., this volume). Geo- chronologically calibrated deformational indicators (e.g., stratal- tilt data) are not well established in the Albuquerque Basin, but they also suggest a slight decrease in stratal tilt across the Rinco- nes paleosurface (Connell, 2008b). The slight change in tilts of the underlying Miocene strata suggest that the Rincones and lower Ortiz paleosurfaces were cut following major deformation and support a reduction in tectonism after ca. 6 Ma. Plio-Pleistocene Sedimentation and Axial-Drainage Development The relatively long Miocene phase of internal surface drainage gave way to through-going drainage of the ancestral Rio Grande into southern New Mexico by early Pliocene time (Figs. 23B\u201323C; Leeder et al., 1996; Mack et al., 2002, 2006).

The integration of ancestral Rio Grande drainage into southern New Mexico could have been a consequence of progressive onlap of Pliocene sediments over low-lying structural culminations between these basins (Cather et al., 1994). The Rincones and lower Ortiz paleosurfaces became pro- gressively buried by the Ceja, Sierra Ladrones, and Tuerto For- mations after ca. 3.0 Ma (Figs. 22 and 23C). The Ceja succession began to coarsen slightly in the Los Lunas section (LLV) after 3.6 Ma, but did not become dominated by coarse-grained detritus until after ca. 2.6 Ma. Coarsening of the Ceja Formation culmi- nated with the deposition of areally extensive sheets of pebble- to boulder-bearing sand that extended across much of the basin and east of the present Rio Grande valley after ca. 1.8 Ma. The overall lack of mud and clay in the upper part of the Ceja Formation indicates that most of the \ufb01 ner-grained sediment was transported out of the basin during this time. This coarsening of the Ceja Formation occurred after integration of the ancestral Rio Grande into southern New Mexico and western Texas (Connell et al., 2005) and was not directly related to base-level lowering of the axial river by drainage capture. Coarsening of the Ceja For- mation ended with the development of the Llano de Albuquerque surface during (or shortly after) the 1.9\u20131.8 Ma Olduvai subchron (Figs. 22 and 23D). After 1.8 Ma, sedimentation was largely restricted to the eastern part of the basin, where the course of the ancestral Rio Grande (Sierra Ladrones Formation) was within 5 km of the basin-boundary fault system. Also after 1.8 Ma, the Sierra Ladrones Formation lapped westward onto the abandoned top of the Ceja Formation and graded toward the Llano de Albuquer- que surface. The presence of the Olduvai subchron in the Ceja and Sierra Ladrones Formations demonstrates contemporaneous sedimentation for these units and precludes incision of an earlier paleovalley of the ancestral Rio Grande (cf. Cole et al., 2001, 2007). Like the Ceja Formation, gravel in the axial-\ufb02 uvial mem- ber of the Sierra Ladrones Formation increased"

Cole et al., 2001, 2007). Like the Ceja Formation, gravel in the axial-\ufb02 uvial mem- ber of the Sierra Ladrones Formation increased in size and abun- dance after 2.6 Ma, but the piedmont member deposits prograded away from the master fault after ca. 1.8\u20131.6 Ma (Figs. 21C and 23C). Deposition of the Sierra Ladrones Formation continued for another 1 m.y. until entrenchment of the Rio Grande valley began shortly after 0.8 Ma. Depositional Patterns The stratigraphy of the Albuquerque Basin generally fol- lows a progression of drainage development and sedimentation patterns that is similar to other continental rifts (e.g., Lambiase and Bosworth, 1995; Contreras et al., 1997; Olsen, 1997). The basins initially become dominated by internal surface drainage as subsidence exceeds sedimentation. This results in an under- \ufb01 lled condition that persists until sediment discharge exceeds the volume of basin formed by subsidence. The basin then becomes over\ufb01 lled, leading to the topographic and hydrologic connec- tion with adjoining, lower-lying basins. At higher rates of strain, topographic closure of the basin would be maintained, even with increasing contributions of sediment (e.g., Contreras et al., 1997). It is possible that the stratigraphic progression in the Albuquer- que Basin may re\ufb02 ect an evolutionary phase in the development of rift-basin alluvial sequences, where climatically induced increases in sediment delivery, rather than tectonism, dominate the Plio-Pleistocene stratigraphic architecture (see below). The asynchronous progradation of \ufb02 uvial deposits derived from opposing basin \ufb02 anks, and the development of diachron- ous relict (depositional) tops on the Plio-Pleistocene alluvial suc- cession, may be a geometric consequence of asymmetrical basin subsidence where basinward tilting of the hanging-wall ramp pro- motes extensive sediment bypass near the basin \ufb02 anks (Figs. 22 and 23; Connell et al., 2001a; Smith et al., 2001). The distal hang- ing-wall ramp has a fore-tilted basin geometry that allows poten- tial accommodation to increase down the structural dip toward the master fault. Back-tilted stratal geometry dominates near the structural footwall cutoff, where accommodation decreases away from the master fault. Because of this fore-tilted geometry, drain- ages would be more sensitive to changes in subsidence than near the (back-tilted) footwall block. Thus, decreases in basin sub- sidence could drive the progradation (of\ufb02 ap) of coarse-grained sediment off of the distal hanging-wall ramp, which would pro- mote sediment bypass and the eventual cessation of deposition as accommodation decreased marginward. Intrabasinal (normal) faulting of the hanging-wall ramp would accentuate erosion and sediment bypass on the upthrown block. The asynchronous depositional pattern in the study area seems to support numerical models of basin \ufb01 lling that suggest progradation of these opposing marginal wedges could be driven by changes in subsidence rate (e.g., Paola et al., 1992; Travis and Nunn, 1994). This progradational couplet is not likely attribut- able to changing subsidence rates because it would require an unreasonably short pulse in tectonism (after 2.6 Ma), followed by a rapid decrease after 1.8 Ma. Long-term (average) sediment accumulation rates for the Ch5 well are slightly higher than those determined for the Gauss-aged part of the Atrisco Member that is exposed near the basin \ufb02 anks (Fig. 21A). The higher average accumulation rate for the Ch5 well suggests that basin subsi- dence did not signi\ufb01 cantly diminish in depocentral areas. Thus, the overall decrease in sediment accumulation in the measured sections may be the result of decreased accommodation toward the basin margins. Synchronous progradation of basin-\ufb02 anking deposits would be expected if sediment \ufb02 ux increased in similarly sized tribu- tary catchments; however, hanging-wall catchments are typi- cally much larger than those on the footwall (e.g., Leeder and Jackson, 1993). Larger hanging-wall catchments should respond to climatic changes with greater magnitude than the smaller footwall catchments. For example, the present Rio Puerco drain- age basin (a major tributary to the Rio Grande) covers nearly 19,000 km2 of the southeastern Colorado Plateau and northwest- ern Albuquerque Basin (Love and Connell, 2005) and is more Downloaded from http://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/books/edited-volume/chapter-pdf/979635/spe494-15.pdf by New Mexico Institute Mining & Technology user Climatic controls on nonmarine depositional sequences in the Albuquerque Basin, Rio Grande rift, New Mexico 419 than 12 times larger than the combined drainage area of the east- ern mountain fronts south of the Hagan embayment (1573 km2 in Anderholm, 2001). The coarsening of the uppermost Ceja succession and for- mation of the Llano de Albuquerque geomorphic surface, before the onset of regional \ufb02 uvial entrenchment, suggests that incision of the paleo\u2013Rio Puerco drainage system may have begun earlier along the structurally higher western \ufb02 ank of the basin. It is not clear whether the remnants of an early paleovalley existed, but such a paleovalley could have graded into a conformable strati- graphic succession toward the southern end of the basin where basin tilting shifted to the west (Russell and Snelson, 1994). If this were the case, the southward course of the present Rio Puerco drainage would be antecedent and controlled by sediment bypass during the \ufb01 nal stages of deposition of the Rio Puerco Member. It is also possible that the depositional top of the Ceja Formation remained active as a thin, transport-dominated surface until the Rio Grande began to incise during early Pleistocene time. This is unlikely because the thickness and degree of pedogenic develop- ment on the Llano de Albuquerque surface supports a greater age of formation than for the younger geomorphic surfaces on the Sierra Ladrones Formation.

Climatic Implications Rates of sediment accumulation, reported from numerous globally distributed settings, increased by a factor of two to ten over the last 4 m.y. (e.g., Zhang et al., 2001). This globally rec- ognized increase in sediment \ufb02 ux is thought to represent a depo- sitional response to increased climatic variability and magnitude (Molnar, 2004). The Late Miocene was a period of extreme aridity that was followed by periods of increased discharge and greater seasonal climate variability (e.g., Axelrod, 1981; Smith, 1994; Webb and Opdyke, 1995; Chapin, 2008). Alluvial successions in the semiarid southwestern regions of North America may record the effects of Pliocene and Pleisto- cene climatic change on both tectonically active and quiescent basins. Studies of Plio-Pleistocene \ufb02 uviolacustrine and \ufb02 uvial deposits (St. David Formation) in the tectonically quiescent San Pedro Valley of southeastern Arizona (Fig. 2) indicate an increase in sheet channels and sand-to-mud ratios and a reduc- tion in sediment accumulation rates after the Gauss-Matuyama chron boundary at 2.58 Ma (Smith, 1994). These sedimentologic changes coincided with climate changes inferred from the stable- isotopic composition of pedogenic carbonate in paleosols (Smith et al., 1993). A similar correspondence between basin sedimen- tation and climate was also reported for Plio-Pleistocene \ufb02 uvial deposits of the Palomas and Camp Rice Formations in the tec- tonically active Rio Grande rift in southern New Mexico (Mack et al., 1993, 1994). The Plio-Pleistocene alluvial succession in the Albuquerque Basin is interpreted to re\ufb02 ect the effects of long-term aggrada- tion within a basin that has been subjected to either constant or decreasing rates of tectonic subsidence since Miocene time. Dur- ing Late Miocene through early Pliocene time, subsidence would continue to deform the basin \ufb02 anks as discharges diminished to a level where basin depocenters would receive less sediment. Later increases in discharge would strip the uplifted basin \ufb02 anks and surrounding upland regions and provide more sediment for the basin. Although subsidence controls cannot be completely ruled out, the overall upward coarsening of this alluvial succession and increase in gravel size supports augmentation of discharge in the sediment delivery system, rather than solely due to a reduction in tectonic subsidence. Changes in sedimentation may have been driven by expan- sion of hinterland drainage area (Fraser and DeCelles, 1992), late Cenozoic climatic variability (Zhang et al., 2001; Chapin, 2008), or diminished basin subsidence (e.g., Mack and Seager, 1990). The present limits of the major western tributaries to the Albuquerque Basin were probably established by late Pliocene time (Love and Connell, 2005). Studies of the Arroyo Ojito and Ceja Formations indicate that crystalline basement rock was probably exposed by Late Miocene time (Connell et al., 1999), so durable basement rocks would have been exposed in hin- terland catchment regions before the Ceja streams transported coarse-grained deposits. Amalgamated coarse-grained channel deposits in the Ceja, Sierra Ladrones, and Tuerto Formations occurred after sediment- accumulation rates decreased on the distal hanging-wall ramp (Fig. 21B and 21C), suggesting that the basin may have \ufb01 lled to a level that promoted extensive sediment bypass through the basin. Although a decrease in sedimentation rate and overall coarsen- ing of the Ceja section during late Pliocene time may suggest a decrease in subsidence rate, it seems unlikely that diminished subsidence can solely account for the relatively sudden introduc- tion of coarse-grained clastic detritus into the basin following a decrease in sediment-accumulation rate. The approximately coeval depositional responses in the Albuquerque Basin and the tectonically quiescent San Pedro Valley of Arizona (Smith, 1994) suggest that climate may play an important role in the develop- ment of sedimentary sequences in slowly subsiding basins. The 0.8 Ma onset of valley cutting coincides with the start of eccentricity-driven climate cycles (e.g., Zachos et al., 2001) and is within the chronological resolution reported for the cutting of the Rio Grande valley in southern New Mexico (Mack et al., 2006) and in southeastern Arizona (Smith, 1994). The transition from basin \ufb01 lling to valley cutting also agrees with other studies that document the onset of major regional incision before 0.6 Ma (e.g., Dethier, 2001). The timing of onset of incision and the approximate number (and age) of inset terrace deposits support the importance of regional climatic controls, rather than tectonic changes, to base level (Gile et al., 1981; Connell et al., 2007a; Leeder and Mack, 2007). Valley incision in central and southern New Mexico may be slightly older than the 0.43 Ma age of over\ufb02 ow that Machette et al. (2007, this volume) postulated for their Lake Alamosa in the Rio Grande headwaters region, ~240 km north of Albuquerque and near the Colorado\u2013New Mexico state line (Fig. 2).

Such a lag would not support capture of the upper Rio Grande as the principal driver of downstream valley incision in central and southern New Mexico (Wells et al., 1987). It is possible that Pleistocene integration of the upper Rio Grande drainage might have been promoted by \ufb01 lling of the southern San Luis Basin by sediment in response to climatically induced increases in discharge.

It is possible that Pleistocene integration of the upper Rio Grande drainage might have been promoted by \ufb01 lling of the southern San Luis Basin by sediment in response to climatically induced increases in discharge. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS We utilized combined geochronologic, sequence- stratigraphic, sedimentologic, and geomorphologic approaches to interpret- ing the development of a Plio-Pleistocene alluvial sequence in the Albuquerque Basin of the Rio Grande rift in north-central New Mexico. Seventy-eight new and previously published age determinations re\ufb01 ne the ages of Miocene through lower Pleistocene basin \ufb01 ll of the synrift Santa Fe Group. These geo- chronologic data permitted the development of a robust mag- netic-polarity stratigraphy for the Plio-Pleistocene part of the basin-\ufb01 ll succession. The Ceja and Sierra Ladrones Formations form a nonmarine depositional sequence that is bounded by distinct sets of erosional and depositional surfaces. Deposition of Upper Miocene strata in the Albuquerque Basin ceased shortly after 6.3 Ma and is marked by widespread erosion of the basin \ufb02 anks and development of the Rincones and lower Ortiz paleosurfaces. The upper boundaries of this alluvial sequence are de\ufb01 ned by a suite of relict depositional surfaces that include the Ca\u00f1ada Colorada, Llano de Albuquer- que, Las Huertas, Sunport, and Llano de Manzano surfaces. Integration of axial-river drainage (by the ancestral Rio Grande) through the Albuquerque Basin occurred by 4.8 Ma, probably as a result of increased sedimentation that began to bury these areally extensive Upper Miocene unconformities, eventually burying low-lying structural culminations that divided the south- ern Albuquerque and Socorro Basins. Progressive, marginward onlap of the Ceja and Tuerto Formations eventually buried the Rincones and lower Ortiz paleosurfaces between 2.8 and 2.6 Ma. Later stages of paleosurface burial corresponded to a coarsening of the Ceja succession, and culminated with the development of the Llano de Albuquerque surface shortly after 1.8 Ma. Deposi- tion of the Sierra Ladrones Formation continued for another mil- lion years until cutting of the Rio Grande valley initiated shortly after 0.8 Ma. Progradation of Sierra Ladrones piedmont deposits away from the master fault began after ca. 1.8\u20131.6 Ma. Cutting of the Rio Grande valley (south of the Espa\u00f1ola Basin) coincided with increased global climatic variability, and may have occurred before entrenchment of the headwaters region of the Rio Grande in southern Colorado. The asynchronous progradation of margin-sourced depos- its in this stratigraphic succession probably re\ufb02 ects a geometric response to decreasing accommodation up the hanging-wall ramp. The fore-tilted geometry of the hanging wall promoted prograda- tion of amalgamated channels that formed broad sheets across the distal hanging-wall ramp as sediment bypassed the basin margins. Reduced sediment accumulation rates after 3.0 Ma may represent extensive sediment bypass. Although active tectonism is clearly of \ufb01 rst-order importance in the formation of sedimen- tary successions, the development of an Plio-Pleistocene alluvial sequence in the Albuquerque Basin may re\ufb02 ect the importance of climate on basin \ufb01 lling in slowly subsiding basins.
