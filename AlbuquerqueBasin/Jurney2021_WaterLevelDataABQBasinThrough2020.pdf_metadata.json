Water-Level Data for the Albuquerque Basin and Adjacent Areas, Central New Mexico, Period of Record Through September 30, 2020 By Elaiya R. Jurney and Meghan T. Bell Abstract The Albuquerque Basin, located in central New Mexico, is about 100 miles long and 25\u201340 miles wide. The basin is hydrologically defined as the extent of consolidated and unconsolidated deposits of Tertiary and Quaternary age that encompasses the structural Rio Grande Rift between San Acacia to the south and Cochiti Lake to the north. A 20-percent population increase in the basin from 1990 to 2000 and a 22-percent population increase from 2000 to 2010 resulted in an increased demand for water in areas within the basin. Drinking-water supplies throughout the basin were obtained solely from groundwater resources until December 2008, when the Albuquerque Bernalillo County Water Utility Authority (ABCWUA) began treatment and distribution of surface water from the Rio Grande through the San Juan-Chama Drinking Water Project. An initial network of wells was established by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) in cooperation with the City of Albuquerque from April 1982 through September 1983 to monitor changes in groundwater levels throughout the Albuquerque Basin. In 1983, this network consisted of 6 wells with analog-to-digital recorders and 27 wells where water lev\u00ad els were measured monthly. As of 2020, the network consisted of 120 wells and piezometers. A piezometer is a specialized well open to a specific depth in the aquifer, often of small diameter and nested with other piezometers screened at dif\u00ad ferent depths. The USGS, in cooperation with the ABCWUA, the New Mexico Office of the State Engineer, and Bernalillo County, measures water levels from the wells and piezometers in the network; this report, prepared in cooperation with the ABCWUA, presents water-level data collected by USGS per\u00ad sonnel at the sites through water year 2020 (October 1, 2019, through September 30, 2020). Water levels that were collected from discontinued wells in previous water years were pub\u00ad lished in previous USGS reports. Introduction The Albuquerque Basin, located in central New Mexico, is about 100 miles long and 25\u201340 miles wide (fig. 1). The basin is defined as the extent of consolidated and unconsoli\u00ad dated deposits of Tertiary and Quaternary age that encom\u00ad passes the structural Rio Grande Rift (Thorn and others, 1993). The basin is approximately bisected by the southward- flowing Rio Grande, the only perennial stream extending through the length of it. The study area, which includes the Albuquerque Basin and adjacent areas, extends from just upstream from Cochiti Lake south to San Acacia and from near Tijeras Canyon west to near the intersection of Interstate 40 and the Bernalillo-Cibola County line. In 2000, the population of the Albuquerque Basin was about 690,000 (Bartolino and Cole, 2002). According to 2010 U.S. Census Bureau data, the 2010 population was about 840,000 (U.S. Census Bureau, 2019; calculated as the sum of population for census tract centers within the basin). The basin population increased about 20 percent from 1990 to 2000 (Thorn and others, 1993; Bartolino and Cole, 2002) and about 22 percent from 2000 to 2010 (U.S. Census Bureau, 2019). The majority of the population is concentrated within the city limits of Albuquerque, which had a population of 448,607 in 2000 and 545,852 in 2010 (U.S. Census Bureau, 2012). Prior to 2008, demand for groundwater increased as popula\u00ad tion increased because drinking-water supplies throughout the Albuquerque Basin were obtained solely from groundwa\u00ad ter sources. In December 2008, the Albuquerque Bernalillo County Water Utility Authority (ABCWUA) began treat\u00ad ment and distribution of surface water from the Rio Grande to their customers through the San Juan-Chama Drinking Water Project. An initial network of wells was established by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) in cooperation with the City of Albuquerque from April 1982 through September 1983 to monitor changes in groundwater levels throughout the Albuquerque Basin. In 1983, this network consisted of 6 wells with analog-to-digital recorders and 27 wells where water levels were measured monthly.

Location of the study area and selected monitoring wells and piezometers in and adjacent to the Albuquerque Basin, central New Mexico. Introduction 3 network, and as of 2020 the network consisted of 120 wells and piezometers (table 1). A piezometer is a specialized well screened at a specific depth in the aquifer, often of small diameter and nested with other piezometers screened at differ\u00ad ent depths. Of these wells and piezometers, 65 are equipped with continuously recording data loggers, and 55 are measured discretely semiannually, quarterly, or every 2\u20133 months with a steel or electric tape. Discrete measurements are also collected at sites with data loggers but are not shown in this report with the exception of sites 42\u201345 (table 1), which have more than 10 years of discrete measurements prior to the installation of continuously recording data loggers. The USGS, in cooperation with the ABCWUA, the New Mexico Office of the State Engineer (NMOSE), and Bernalillo County, measures water levels from the previously defined groundwater monitoring network (table 1). Monitoring-well locations within the basin and adjacent areas are shown in figure 1, and those within the Albuquerque metropolitan area are shown in figure 2. The data presented in this report are available in the USGS National Water Information System (U.S. Geological Survey, 2021). Purpose and Scope The purpose of this report is to present groundwater- level data collected from the Albuquerque Basin well net\u00ad work during the 2020 water year (October 1, 2019, through September 30, 2020). Measurements at certain wells have been discontinued for various reasons; groundwater-level data that were collected from those discontinued wells in previous water years can be found in previous USGS reports (Kues, 1987; Rankin, 1994, 1996, 1998, 1999, 2000; DeWees, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2006; Beman, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2020; Beman and Torres, 2010; Beman and Bryant, 2016; Beman and others, 2019; Ritchie and Galanter, 2019). A water year is the 12-month period from October 1 through September 30 and is designated by the calendar year in which it ends. Well-Numbering System The system of numbering wells and piezometers in New Mexico is based on the common subdivision of public lands into sections (fig. 3). Each well number, in addition to desig\u00ad nating the well, locates the position to the nearest 10-acre tract in the Public Land Survey System. This number (referred to as \u201clocal identifier\u201d in table 1) is divided into four segments. The first segment denotes the township (\u201cT.\u201d) north or south of the New Mexico base line, the second denotes the range (\u201cR.\u201d) east or west of the New Mexico principal meridian, and the third denotes the section. The fourth segment of the well number, which consists of three digits, denotes the 160-, 40-, and 10-acre tracts in which the well is located. Each section is divided into quarters, which are numbered 1, 2, 3, and 4 for the northwest, northeast, southwest, and southeast quarters, respectively. The first digit of the fourth segment gives the quarter section, which is a tract of 160 acres. Each quarter section is then subdivided into four 40-acre tracts numbered in the same manner, and the second digit denotes the 40-acre tract. Finally, each 40-acre tract is further subdivided into four 10-acre tracts, and the third digit denotes the 10-acre tract. The fourth segment of the well number can further denote subdivi\u00ad sions of the 10-acre tract by including more than three digits; each additional digit further subdivides the tract by quarters in the same manner as shown in figure 3. Letters A, B, C, and so on are added to the end of the last segment of the well number to designate the second, third, fourth, and succeeding wells in the same tract. For example, well 09N.03E.07.131A is the first subsequent well in the northwest quarter (NW 1/4) of the southwest quarter (SW 1/4) of the northwest quarter (NW 1/4) of section 7, T. 09 N., R. 03 E. (Bureau of Land Management, 2009). Methods Water-level measurements at the groundwater monitor\u00ad ing network were collected during the 2020 water year by following standard USGS protocols for discrete and continu\u00ad ous water-level measurements using steel or electric tapes and continuously recording data loggers (Cunningham and Schalk, 2011). Discrete measurements are collected at 55 of the sites (table 1); 49 sites (2, 4, 9, 10, 12\u201320, 24\u201330, 32\u201341, 46\u201351, 53\u201355, 68, 70\u201373, 76, 81, 83, 87, and 237) are monitored semiannually, 2 sites (230 and 231) are monitored quarterly, and 3 sites (222\u2013224) are monitored every 2\u20133 months. At 65 of the sites (42\u201345, 64, 165\u2013184, 189\u2013194, 196\u2013203, 205\u2013217, 219\u2013221, 225\u2013229, and 232\u2013236; table 1), pressure transduc\u00ad ers and data loggers"

Location of selected monitoring wells and piezometers within the Albuquerque, New Mexico, metropolitan area. 10 Water-Level Data for the Albuquerque Basin and Adjacent Areas, Central New Mexico, Period of Record Through Sept. 30, 2020 Water-Level Data Data for the groundwater monitoring network listed in table 1 include site number, number of the figure on which the well location is shown, USGS site number, local identi\u00ad fier, other identifier (if applicable), latitude and longitude, well depth, screened interval, and method of water-level measurement that is shown in figure 4. Hydrographs present\u00ad ing water-level data collected by the USGS include water level in feet below land surface and water level in feet above the North American Vertical Datum of 1988 (NAVD 88) (fig. 4). Data in hydrographs from wells that have continuous (hourly) recorders are shown by solid lines that represent daily mean water levels (fig. 4). In hydrographs that present data from discretely measured wells, dashed lines connect symbols (\u201c+\u201d) that represent the discrete measurements (fig. 4). In hydrographs showing discretely measured piezometers that are nested (more than one trace per graph), the symbols were removed to make the hydrographs easier to read (fig. 4). There are two hydrographs presenting data for sites 42\u201345 and for site 218 (table 1): one showing continuous data and one show\u00ad ing discrete water-level measurements (fig. 4). The period of record for discrete measurements is much longer than that of continuous data in some locations. For those wells, both hydrographs have been included to ensure that all data are presented. Data gaps are present in some of the continuous hydrographs; these gaps may be caused by equipment mal\u00ad function or removal of spurious data during the review and approval process. Continuous and discrete water-level data are published online through the National Water Information System (USGS, 2021). The transducer was removed from site 218 on July 16, 2019, after which continuous data collection was halted and discrete data collection continued. The transducers and data loggers were removed from sites 222\u2013224 in 2014, but discrete measurements continue to be collected at those sites since that time. Continuous data from sites 222\u2013224 can be viewed in the previous USGS reports.
