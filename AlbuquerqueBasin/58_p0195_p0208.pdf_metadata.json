Annual NMGS Fall Field Conference Guidebooks Every fall since 1950, the New Mexico Geological Society (NMGS) has held an annual Fall Field Conference that explores some region of New Mexico (or surrounding states). Always well attended, these conferences provide a guidebook to participants. Besides detailed road logs, the guidebooks contain many well written, edited, and peer-reviewed geoscience papers. These books have set the national standard for geologic guidebooks and are an essential geologic reference for anyone working in or around New Mexico. Free Downloads NMGS has decided to make peer-reviewed papers from our Fall Field Conference guidebooks available for free download. This is in keeping with our mission of promoting interest, research, and cooperation regarding geology in New Mexico. However, guidebook sales represent a significant proportion of our operating budget. Therefore, only research papers are available for download. Road logs, mini-papers, and other selected content are available only in print for recent guidebooks.

INTRODUCTION Three physiographic features converge near the southwestern \ufb02ank of the Jemez Mountains. To the west lies the Laramide Sierra Nacimiento uplift, to the northeast is the Neogene Jemez volcanic \ufb01eld, and to the south stretches the Albuquerque basin, one of the largest extensional basins of the Cenozoic Rio Grande rift (Fig. 1). Examination of stratigraphic relationships in this area provides important clues regarding the transition from Laramide compres- sion to Rio Grande rift extension. Rocks of the Miocene Zia For- mation and the Oligocene-Miocene Abiquiu Formation, locally exposed along the southeastern \ufb02ank of the Sierra Nacimiento and southwestern \ufb02ank of the Jemez Mountains, provide an oppor- tunity to understand the stratigraphic relationship between these two units. The Abiquiu Formation and Zia Formation both contain Arikareean fossils indicating that they are partly time correlative (Tedford and Barghoorn, 1993). Similarity of pollen assemblages in the Abiquiu Formation (from both the southern and northern \ufb02anks of the Jemez Mountains) and Zia Formation also support temporal correlation (Duchene et al., 1981). Based on biostrati- graphic correlation of these two units, Ingersoll (2001) proposed an early structural linkage between the Albuquerque and Espa- \u00f1ola basins that existed during early and middle Miocene time. According to Ingersoll, this linkage persisted until late Miocene time, when the locus of subsidence shifted to the current eastern structural margin of the Albuquerque basin. Ongoing geologic studies in the southwestern Jemez Moun- tains clarify the stratigraphic position of the Abiquiu and Zia For- mations and allow a partial test of Ingersoll\u2019s model of structural (tilt-polarity) inversion of the northern Albuquerque basin. This paper is an update of a report by Connell et al. (2001) and presents data describing Eocene and Oligocene deposits across the north- ern part of the Albuquerque basin. We describe the stratigraphy of the Abiquiu-Zia succession exposed along the hanging wall of the Jemez fault zone, between the towns of Gilman and Ca\u00f1on, New Mexico. We also describe lithologic cuttings from the Tamara #1-Y well, an oil-test drilled about 30 km south-southeast of the Gilman-Ca\u00f1on area. Lastly, we discuss stratigraphic relations among these deep oil-test wells and their implications for the stratigraphic and tectonic history of the northwestern Albuquer- que basin.

In the Rio Jemez drainage, between the towns of Gilman and Ca\u00f1on, New Mexico, a previously unrec- ognized stratigraphic relationship between the Abiquiu Formation and the Zia Formation clari\ufb01es the tectonic history of the region. The Zia Formation overlies older rocks provisionally assigned to the Abiquiu Formation. Examination of drill-hole cut- tings from the Tamara #1-Y well in the adjacent Albuquerque basin reveal a thick pre-Zia Formation stratigraphic succession assigned to the unit of Isleta well #2. This unit locally exceeds 2 km in thickness in other wells in the Albuquerque basin. The unit of Isleta well #2 is represented by a thin discontinuous lag of intermediate volcanic tuff ventifacts preserved on the foot- wall of the San Ysidro fault zone. Thickness variations within the unit of Isleta well #2 across documented geologic structures across a 5-15 km-wide area of the northwestern Albuquerque basin support the presence of a late Oligocene phase of faulting and erosion before deposition of the Zia Formation.

Discussion of local Laramide geologic history was presented by Cather (2004). Discussions of the geologic history and stratigraphy of the northern Rio Grande rift were summarized by Connell (2004) and Smith (2004). Previ- ous geologic studies of the southwestern Jemez Mountains (Smith et al., 1970) and Sierra Nacimiento (Woodward, 1987) delineated rocks associated with the transition from Paleogene compression to regional Oligocene-Miocene volcanism and Oligocene-Holo- cene extension of the Rio Grande rift. Syn-Laramide deposition (east and southeast of the San Juan Basin) basin is recorded by the Eocene Galisteo Formation, a succession of \ufb02uvial and \ufb02uviola- custrine sediments laid down by rivers draining Laramide uplands in the Sangre de Cristo Mountains and Sierra Nacimiento (e.g., Cather, 2004). Exposures of the Galisteo Formation in the north- western Albuquerque basin are late Eocene in age and consist of white to light gray sandstone and pebbly sandstone with interbeds of light green and reddish brown claystone (Fig. 1; Windmill Hill site of Lucas, 1982). Older Laramide rocks (Paleocene Diamond Tail Formation) are exposed on the eastern margin of the Albu- querque basin and in the Hagan embayment (Lucas et al., 1997). Epiclastic and volcanic rocks of the Abiquiu Formation (e.g., Smith et al., 2002), unit of Isleta well #2 (Lozinsky, 1994), and Espinaso Formation (e.g., Stearns, 1953; Kautz et al., 1981) over- lie syn-Laramide deposits, such as the Galisteo Formation (Fig. 2). The Mogollon, Datil, and Spears groups constitute a thick suite of epiclastic, volcaniclastic, and volcanic rocks associated with emplacement of the Mogollon-Datil volcanic \ufb01eld in central New Mexico (e.g., Osburn and Chapin, 1983; Chapin et al., 2004). The Abiquiu Formation in its type area in the northern Jemez Mountains is a thick succession of epiclastic deposits derived from the Latir volcanic \ufb01eld in northern New Mexico (Smith et al., 2002). The lower Abiquiu in the type area is a conglomerate with clasts of Proterozoic granite, quartzite, quartz, and Pennsyl- vanian limestone. The Abiquiu Formation was deposited between 18-27 Ma (Fig. 2; Baldridge et al., 1980; May, 1980 and 1984; Tedford and Barghoorn, 1993). It is dominantly feldspathic to lithic in composition, ranging among arkose to lithic arkose, and to feldspathic litharenite (Fig. 3; Moore, 2000). Radioisotopic dating (40Ar/39Ar and K-Ar methods) of \ufb02uvially transported gravel of the rhyolitic Amalia Tuff (from the Latir volcanic \ufb01eld; Lipman and Reed, 1989) and basalt \ufb02ows near the town of Ojo Caliente indicates that most of the Abiquiu Formation was depos- ited between 18 and 25 Ma (Baldridge et al., 1980; May, 1980, 1984; Smith et al., 2002). In the southwestern Jemez Mountains region, pollen assemblages are similar for the Zia and Abiquiu formations (Duchene et al., 1981), but are insuf\ufb01ciently precise to establish relative stratigraphic order there. The unit of Isleta well #2 (upper Eocene-Oligocene) is found in deep drill-holes in the northern part of the Albuquerque basin. This name was informally proposed by Lozinsky (1994) for a succession of purplish red to gray volcanic-bearing sandstone and mudstone in the Shell Isleta #2 well, located about 80 km south of the Gilman-Ca\u00f1on area (Fig. 1). This deposit reaches a thickness of 2185 m in the Shell West Mesa Federal #1 well (Lozinsky, 1994). Detrital modes of sand range between arkose, lithic arkose, and subarkose (Fig. 3; Lozinsky, 1994). Geochrono- logic control is limited to a single K-Ar age of 36.3 \u00b1 1.8 Ma for an ash-\ufb02ow tuff at 5779 m bls (below land surface) in the Shell Isleta #2 well (Fig. 2; May and Russell, 1994, p. 118). This ash- \ufb02ow tuff is about 838 m above their interpreted base of the unit of Isleta well #2. Based on this age, the unit of Isleta well #2 is temporally correlative to parts of the ~39-27 Ma Mogollon-Datil volcanic \ufb01eld and Spears Group to the south (Osburn and Chapin, 1983; Chapin et al., 2004), and ~26-36 Ma Espinaso Formation to the northeast (e.g., Kautz et al., 1981). This K-Ar age is slightly older than ~30-33 Ma volcanism associated with the San Juan volcanic \ufb01eld (e.g., Lipman, 1989). The Zia Formation (Galusha, 1966) is a succession of eolian and \ufb02uviatile sandstone exposed in the northwestern Albuquer- FIGURE 2.

The Piedra Parada Member unconformably overlies sedimentary rocks of the Eocene Galisteo Formation and Upper Cretaceous Menefee Formation (Connell et al., 1999; Tedford and Barghoorn, 1999). The age of the lower Piedra Parada Member is constrained by mammalian fossils at Standing Rock quarry (Galusha, 1966), which sits 19-21 m above the Piedra Parada Member-Galisteo Formation contact.

STRATIGRAPHY Southwestern Jemez Mountains Oligocene and lower Miocene rocks in the southwestern Jemez Mountains are exposed along part of the structural margin of the Albuquerque basin and southeastern \ufb02ank of the Sierra Nacimiento. Sandstone and volcaniclastic conglomerate preserved on the hanging wall of the Sierrita and Jemez fault zones were assigned to the Abiquiu Formation by Duchene et al. (1981). This name is provisionally retained until current geologic studies of the Jemez Mountains are complete. Between Gilman and Ca\u00f1on, the Abiquiu Formation rests unconformably on Lower Permian red sandstone and mudstone of the Abo and Yeso formations (Fig. 4; Woodward et al., 1977). A stratigraphic section, measured and described just north of the Jemez Pueblo Grant boundary near Ca\u00f1on (Gilman quadrangle), is about 140 m thick and consists of well-cemented, tabular sandstone and volcaniclastic conglom- erate of the Abiquiu Formation overlain by poorly consolidated sand assigned to the Zia Formation (Fig. 5, Appendix). The Abiquiu Formation here is locally informally subdivided into a lower volcaniclastic unit and an upper \ufb02uvial unit; future work may result in formally de\ufb01ning new members of the Abiquiu Formation. The lower unit consists of 56 m of cobbly sandstone and conglomerate containing rounded volcanic clasts of mostly andesite and dacite. Two andesitic pebbles yielded groundmass 40Ar/39Ar ages of 28.55 \u00b1 0.07 Ma and 28.63 \u00b1 0.10 Ma; two biotite-hornblende dacite pebbles yielded 40Ar/39Ar ages of 29.38 \u00b1 0.59 Ma and 29.22 \u00b1 0.58 Ma (W.C. McIntosh, umpubl. data). These ages place constraints on the maximum age of the volcani- clastic unit. Very sparse granite and rounded orthoquartzite (<1% by volume) and angular pink feldspar grains are present in the lower 2 m of the deposit. The relative percentage of granule to pebble-sized granitic detritus increases to 5-10% in the upper 10 m of the lower volcaniclastic unit. Imbricated volcanic cobbles in the basal 10 to 15 m of the deposit indicate \ufb02ow toward the west (Fig. 5; 270\u00ba, n=28) at Ca\u00f1on, and northeast (33\u00ba, n=34) in expo- sures just west of Gilman (Fig. 1). This lower volcaniclastic unit is overlain by 56 m of well-cemented, tabular, medium- to thin- bedded sandstone. Many of the medium beds form ledges and are sparsely cross strati\ufb01ed. The contact between these two units is sharp and contains granite together with rounded, multi-colored, polished chert and orthoquartzite pebbles. 40Ar/39Ar dating on a fallout ash in tabular sandstone in Ca\u00f1on de la Ca\u00f1ada yielded a biotite age of 20.61 \u00b1 0.07 Ma (Osburn et al., 2002; Kelley and Connell, 2004). Paleocurrent directions determined from cross beds near the top of the upper \ufb02uvial unit indicate \ufb02ow toward 120 to 170\u00ba, although a couple of beds indicate \ufb02ow directions towards the north (360-350\u00ba). The upper sandstone-bearing suc- cession is disconformably overlain by massive, poorly-exposed sandstone that we correlate to the Zia Formation. Tamara #1-Y well The Tamara #1-Y well (API 30-043-20934) is an oil wildcat well drilled about 16 km northwest of Rio Rancho, New Mexico, and 30 km south of the Gilman-Ca\u00f1on area (Figs. 1, 5, 6; Sec. 3, T13N., R2E., Bernalillo NW quadrangle; UTM coordinate of E: 344,615 m, N: 3,916,580 m, Zone 13, NAD83). This well was drilled by Davis Petroleum Corporation between December 1, 1995 and January 16, 1996, near La Ceja (Rincones de Zia of Galusha, 1966), at an elevation of about 1865 m above mean sea level. The Tamara #1-Y well is important because it penetrates the entire Cenozoic section and allows comparisons to nearby wells studied by Lozinsky (1994) and Black and Hiss (1974). Accord- FIGURE 3.

Sparse volcanic detritus was recognized in cuttings correlated to the Galisteo Formation. Drill-hole cuttings are pre- dominantly \ufb01ne- to coarse-grained sand, with interbedded mud and sparse \ufb01ne gravelly sand, belonging to the Arroyo Ojito and Zia formations. Sand composition ranges from subarkose, lithic arkose, and feldspathic litharenite (Fig. 3). The stratigraphy of the upper part of the Tamara #1-Y well is constrained by exposures less than 1 km to the north that have been mapped in detail (Koning and Personius, 2002; Koning et al., 1998; Connell et al., 1999). This geologic mapping indicates that neighboring strata of the Arroyo Ojito and Zia formations dip about 3-10\u00baSW. A dip-meter log of strata below 2103 m bls in the Tamara well indicates that Cretaceous rocks dip as much as 8-30\u00baSW (mostly dips of ~20\u00baSW). It is not known whether stratal tilts in the upper part of the drill-hole section progressively increase down hole, or whether tilts increase across unconfor- mities or faults. Exposures of the Menefee-Galisteo and Mene- fee-Zia contacts indicate only slight angularity (Tedford and Barghoorn, 1999; Connell, 2006), so the dip-meter of the Cre- taceous section may be a reasonable approximation of the lower post-Cretaceous section in the area of the well. Geologic map- ping (Fig. 6) indicates that stratal tilt decreases upsection to a few degrees of horizontal. Stratigraphic thickness corrections (i.e., dip adjustments) are not made for Cenozoic deposits because of these relatively low stratal dips only decrease unit thickness by a few to several meters. Lag times are not known for the samples and may contribute up to several meters of error in estimating stratigraphic bound- aries, but probably result in only a slight increase in estimating unit thickness. Thickness of deposits correlated to the Zia, Cerro Conejo, and Arroyo Ojito Formations in the Tamara well is about 1146 m (Fig. 7; dip-adjusted thickness of 1138 m). This is only slightly thicker than estimates of about 1060 m for a composite Zia-Arroyo Ojito Formation section exposed to the west on the footwalls of the Zia and San Ysidro faults (Connell et al., 1999), but is considerably thicker than the approximately 410 m of Zia Formation exposed on the footwall of the Sand Hill fault (Ted- ford and Barghoorn, 1999), near the western structural boundary of the basin.

Projections of this interval north indicate a correspondence to the Navajo Draw Member of the Arroyo Ojito Formation (Koning and Personius, 2002). Below 378 m bls, a 283 m-thick succession of very pale brown, quartz-rich sand with trace gray altered tephra zones is collectively correlated with the Cerro Conejo Formation (Table 1; usage of Connell, 2006). The base of the Cerro Conejo appears gradational with a 485 m-thick succession of very pale brown to light gray, medium- to coarse-grained, subrounded to rounded, quartz-rich sandstone with abundant frosted quartz grains (Fig. 7). This lower succession is correlated to the Chamisa Mesa and Piedra Parada Members of the Zia Formation. Elsewhere, the Zia Formation is composed of lithic arkose to feldspathic arenite (Fig. 3; Beckner and Mozley, 1998). Thick zones of calcium car- bonate concretions are common in the Zia Formation and lower half of the Cerro Conejo Formation (unnamed member of Zia For- mation; Beckner and Mozley, 1998; Mozley and Davis, 2005). Between 1146 and 1631 m bls is a 485 m-thick succession of pink to very pale brown to reddish yellow, \ufb01ne- to coarse-grained sandstone with minor mudstone. The stratigraphic position of this unit below the Piedra Parada Member suggests a possible correla- tion to stratigraphically lower units, such as the Abiquiu Forma- tion or the unit of Isleta well #2. Examination of cuttings from this interval indicates that the Cenozoic portion of the Tamara well is distinct from the Abiquiu Formation, which contains con- siderably less quartz than Cenozoic deposits in the Tamara well (Fig. 3). Instead, we assign this interval to the unit of Isleta well #2 based on compositional similarities (although this interval is slightly richer in lithic grains) and because of the lack of a very coarse sand or pebble component (Figs. 3, 7; Lozinsky, 1994). In the Tamara well, the unit of Isleta well #2 is divided into two sub- units. The upper subunit (1146-1393 m) is a 247 m-thick inter- val of pink to very pale brown, mostly \ufb01ne- to medium-grained, quartz-rich feldspathic arenite and lithic arkose. Traces of a white ash and sparse scattered volcanic grains are observed between 1283-1292 m and 1366-1375 m bls, respectively. The lower 28 m of the upper subunit contains traces of purplish gray intermediate volcanic detritus. The lower subunit is recognized between 1393 m and 1631 m bls (Fig. 7). This lower subunit consists of about 238 m of reddish yellow, \ufb01ne- to coarse-grained, subrounded to rounded, subarkose and lithic arkose (Fig. 3). Sand grains are commonly cemented together with calcium carbonate indicating that this section is indurated. Lithic fragments from this unit contain abun- dant chert with minor gray intermediate volcanic grains contain- ing hornblende. The lower 55 m of this subunit contains slightly more intermediate to felsic igneous (intrusive or volcanic) grains. This subunit differs from the overlying subunit primarily by its reddish color and a slight increase in volcanic detritus. Petrographic examination of sand sampled from four depth intervals within the unit of Isleta well #2 indicates the presence of abundant volcanic lithic grains (Table 2, Fig. 3). The lower 55 m of the unit contains more volcanic grains than in the upper part. Sand of the unit of Isleta well #2 is petrographically similar to lower Santa Fe Group sand described by Large and Ingersoll (1997), but contains more quartz than Zia Formation sediments described along the western margin of the Albuquerque basin (Beckner and Mozley, 1998). The presence of a slightly more volcanic-rich interval near the bottom of this unit suggests that this volcanic activity occurred during or just prior to deposition. The color and slightly greater abundance of volcanic grains in the lower subunit suggests a closer match to the unit of Isleta well #2 as described by Lozinsky (1994). Sand in the unit of Isleta well #2 is typically well sorted and quartz-rich (Fig. 3). Grains are typically rounded to subrounded and exhibit frosted surfaces. Borehole geophysical logs show an overall smooth to blocky electrical resistivity log signature for this interval (Fig. 6). The relatively uniform geophysical charac- teristics of the unit of Isleta #2 in the Tamara well suggest that it consists mostly of homogeneous sandstone suggestive of eolian deposition. TABLE 2.

The interpreted base of the Galisteo Formation in the Tamara well is 1978 m bls. The Galisteo Formation overlies gray siltstone with interbeds of 5-10% coal that are assigned to the Upper Cretaceous Menefee Formation based on stratigraphic position, and similarity in litho- logic character to exposures mapped to the west and northwest (Fig. 7; Koning et al., 1998). Northwestern Albuquerque basin A disconformity between the Piedra Parada Member of the Zia Formation and underlying Galisteo and Menefee formations is exposed along the western structural margin of the Albuquerque basin (Slack, 1973; Lucas, 1982; Tedford and Barghoorn, 1999). Calcic soils are locally preserved along this contact as are the discontinuous presence of wind-sculpted, gray, volcanic rocks of intermediate composition (ventifacts; Tedford and Barghoorn, 1999). In Arroyo Piedra Parada, about 20 km south of the Gilman- Ca\u00f1on section, the basal 0.5-3 m of the Zia Formation contains \ufb02uviatile gravel composed mostly of rounded chert pebbles with scattered tuff cobbles (Gawne, 1981). In the Rio Puerco Valley, three volcanic ventifacts along this contact were dated using the 40Ar/39Ar method. These cobbles yielded hornblende and biotite ages of 31.8 \u00b1 1.8 Ma, 33.03 \u00b1 0.02 Ma, and 33.24 \u00b1 0.24 Ma, and are consistent with Oligocene volcanism (W.C. McIntosh and S.M. Cather, upubl. data). These ages, however, are not suf- \ufb01ciently precise to correlate to known Oligocene volcanic centers in the region. DISCUSSION Stratigraphic relations exposed between Gilman and Ca\u00f1on demonstrate that sandstone of the Zia Formation overlies well cemented, tabular sandstone assigned to the Abiquiu Formation (Figs. 4, 5). This boundary is sharp and is interpreted to be dis- conformable. South of Ca\u00f1on, the Zia Formation buries deposits of the upper \ufb02uvial unit of the Abiquiu Formation. Dated vol- canic pebbles and fallout tephra in the Abiquiu Formation indi- cates that this unit is early Miocene in age and is correlative with the upper Abiquiu Formation in the Abiquiu embayment (and Chama sub-basin), just north of the Jemez Mountains. The lack of rhyolite-bearing gravel supports the presence of a structural or topographic barrier between the Abiquiu embayment and the southwestern Jemez Mountains before 19 Ma, and suggests the presence of an unknown, possibly nearby, source for these andes- itic gravels. Biostratigraphic constraints for the base of the Piedra Parada Member indicate a late Arikareean age of approximately 19-20 Ma (Tedford et al., 2004). Radioisotopic data constrains the age of the underlying upper Abiquiu Formation to about 20.6 Ma. Thus, the boundary between the Zia Formation and Abiquiu Formation probably spans an interval between 21 and 19 Ma. The Tamara #1-Y well penetrated well-sorted sand between the Galisteo Formation and Zia Formation. This nearly 500 m- thick succession is assigned to the unit of Isleta well #2, and is preserved east of the San Ysidro fault. The Abiquiu and unit of Isleta well #2 successions occupy the same stratigraphic interval, FIGURE 7. Interpreted stratigraphic column of Cenozoic sediments for the Tamara #1-Y well, including natural gamma ray (GR) and electrical conductivity logs (calculated from induction resistivity log, conductiv- ity=1000/resistivity). Stratigraphic interpretations are based on evalua- tion of cuttings and projection of contacts from geologic mapping (Table 1; Appendix). The unit of Isleta well #2 rests upon a 347 m-thick succession of reddish yellow, pink, very pale brown, and light gray sand and gravelly sand that contains abundant grains of granitic detritus. This interval is interpreted to be correlative to the Galisteo For- mation, principally because of its stratigraphic position above the Menefee Formation, greater abundance of granitic detritus, and the similarity in color to nearby mapped units of the Galisteo For- 203 OLIGOCENE AND EARLY MIOCENE SEDIMENTATION suggesting they are at least partly correlative (Fig. 8). The unit of Isleta well #2 succession in the Tamara well is much sandier than in exposures of the Abiquiu Formation in the southwestern Jemez Mountains (Appendix). This textural difference suggests that the unit of Isleta well #2 may represent a different (perhaps more distal) facies of the Abiquiu Formation, or a different unit altogether. Preservation of the unit of Isleta well #2 between the Zia fault and the Ziana anticlinal accommodation zone (Fig. 6; Ziana anti- cline of Kelley, 1977) suggests that block faulting locally pre- served this succession in a structurally low position. Correlative units on uplifted fault blocks to the west were likely stripped before deposition of the Zia Formation. West of the San Ysidro fault, in Arroyo Piedra Parada (Fig. 6), a discontinuous lag of volcanic tuff pebbles and cobbles with abundant rounded chert pebbles reworked from the Galisteo Formation mark the Gali- steo-Zia boundary (Gawne, 1981; Tedford and Barghoorn, 1999). The presence of 32-33 Ma volcanic gravel along the basal contact of the Piedra Parada Member suggests that Oligocene deposits were more laterally extensive prior to deposition of the Zia For- mation. The presence of this discontinuous volcanic gravel lag on the Zia-Galisteo unconformity suggests correlation with deposits associated with either the southern limit of Abiquiu Formation or northern limit of the unit of Isleta well #2 (Fig. 8). The presence of the Zia-Galisteo and Zia-Abiquiu disconformities suggests that this boundary may be regional in nature; however, the correlative boundary between the Zia Formation and subjacent unit of Isleta"

The presence of the Zia-Galisteo and Zia-Abiquiu disconformities suggests that this boundary may be regional in nature; however, the correlative boundary between the Zia Formation and subjacent unit of Isleta well #2 is buried, making it dif\ufb01cult to determine the character of that boundary in the deeper parts of the Albuquerque basin. The Zia Formation thickens between exposures on the foot- wall of the Sand Hill fault (Ceja del Rio Puerco; Tedford and Barghoorn, 1999), and composite measured sections on the hang- ing wall in Arroyo Piedra Parada and Arroyo Ojito (Figs. 6, 9; Galusha, 1966; Connell et al., 1999). To the east, in the Shell Santa Fe Paci\ufb01c #1 well (Lozinsky, 1994), a slightly thicker accumulation of Zia Formation sediments directly overlies the Galisteo Formation on the Ziana accommodation zone (Fig. 9). The presence of an unconformity at the base of the Zia Forma- tion and the absence of unit of Isleta #2 strata at Shell Santa Fe Paci\ufb01c #1 well indicates that the unit of Isleta well #2 was locally eroded prior to deposition of the Piedra Parada Member. Lateral variations in the thickness of this unit, which is stripped at the Shell Santa Fe Paci\ufb01c #1 well but preserved at the Tamara #1-Y well (Fig. 9), supports an episode of faulting and erosion prior to deposition of the Zia Formation. Faults associated with the Ziana accommodation zone cut the Arroyo Ojito Formation (Koning FIGURE 8.

The character of the unit of Isleta well #2 may represent a sandy facies preserved between the distal edges of volcanic cen- ters in the region. It is not clear whether the entire unit of Isleta well #2 represents a syntectonic succession; however, it locally reaches a thickness of 2185 m in the Shell West Mesa Federal #1 well (Fig. 8; Lozinsky, 1994). The preservation of such a substan- tial thickness of unit of Isleta well #2 deposits suggests a tectonic component of formation. Geomorphic and \ufb02exural subsidence models of sedimentation resulting from increased topographic relief and increased loading caused by emplacement of a hypo- thetical volcanic \ufb01eld permits preservation of about 100-300 m of sediment as far as 150 km from the volcanic load (Smith et al., 2002). Using the results of these models, we estimate that less than one kilometer of sediment could be preserved within 50 km of a hypothetical volcanic center such as modeled by Smith et al. The Mogollon-Datil volcanic \ufb01eld is over 100 km from the deep- est known accumulation of the unit of Isleta well #2 at the West Mesa Federal #1 site. The Ortiz volcanic \ufb01eld is about 60 km FIGURE 9.

The San Juan and Latir volcanic \ufb01elds are more than 150 km from this well site. Thus, accumula- tion of more than 2 km of the unit of Isleta well #2 either required creation of a basin through crustal deformation, or the presence of a previously unrecognized volcanic center in the Albuquerque basin. The predominantly sandy character of the unit of Isleta well #2 within wells described by Lozinsky (1994) does not sup- port the presence of a local volcanic center in the northwestern Albuquerque basin. The unit probably represents a distal accu- mulation of sediments. Locally thick accumulations of the unit of Isleta well #2 could have been preserved by broad tectonic subsidence or down-warp- ing. If these deposits were preserved in a syncline, it would have a"

Deposits include the unit of Isleta well #2 (Tis, Tisu=upper subunit; Tisl=lower subunit, Lozinsky, 1994), Zia Formation (Tz), Cerro Conejo Formation (Tcc, usage of Connell, 2006), Arroyo Ojito Formation (To), Ceja Formation (Tc, usage of Connell, 2006), Popotosa Formation (Tp, see Lozinsky, 1994), Sierra Ladrones Formation (QTs), Galisteo Formation (Tg). Deposits overlie Mesozoic (Mz) sedimen- tary rocks. Deposits exposed on eastern side of basin, in the Hagan embayment, include the Tuerto gravels (Stearns, 1953), Blackshare and Tanos Formations (Connell et al., 2002), Espinaso Formation (Kautz et al., 1981), and Galisteo and Diamond Tail Formations (e.g., Stearns, 1953; Gorham, 1979; Lucas et al., 1997).

The San Juan and Latir volcanic \ufb01elds are more than 150 km from this well site. Thus, accumula- tion of more than 2 km of the unit of Isleta well #2 either required creation of a basin through crustal deformation, or the presence of a previously unrecognized volcanic center in the Albuquerque basin. The predominantly sandy character of the unit of Isleta well #2 within wells described by Lozinsky (1994) does not sup- port the presence of a local volcanic center in the northwestern Albuquerque basin. The unit probably represents a distal accu- mulation of sediments. Locally thick accumulations of the unit of Isleta well #2 could have been preserved by broad tectonic subsidence or down-warp- ing. If these deposits were preserved in a syncline, it would have a steeper east limb and a small trough. Such fold geometries are not implausible, but provide a less satisfactory explanation than does normal faulting. The absence of the unit of Isleta well #2 on the crest of the Ziana accommodation zone (at the Shell Santa Fe Paci\ufb01c #1 well) and a 853 to 905 m-thick Zia-Cerro Conejo succession (Fig. 9; Black and Hiss, 1974; Lozinsky, 1994) dem- onstrates pre-Zia thinning across this intrabasinal structure. The increase in thickness from less than a few meters to more than 500 m across the trace of the San Ysidro fault and Ziana zone (over a distance of 5 to 15 km) supports a pre-Piedra Parada phase of faulting and erosion. We agree with Ingersoll (2001) regarding the presence of an earlier phase of deformation in the northern Albuquerque basin, but we differ in our interpretation of the timing of this deforma- tional event. We place the timing of this earlier event in the Oli- gocene and not late Miocene time. The oldest exposed deposits of the Santa Fe Group in the northern Albuquerque basin are in the Hagan embayment (Fig. 1), where the Tanos Formation dis- conformably overlies the Espinaso Formation. Deposition of the Tanos Formation began just before 25.4 Ma (Figs. 2, 9; Connell et al., 2002). These deposits are more than 5 m. y. older than deposits of the Zia Formation exposed in the northwestern part of the basin. Deposition of the unit of Isleta well #2 occurred before 20 Ma in the northwestern part of the basin. It is not clear whether the entire unit of Isleta well #2 marks the transition from compressional to extensional tectonism in the area, but the accumulation of such a thick succession supports tectonic control on the deposition of this unit. Much of the unit of Isleta #2 basin is buried, so there are few data to constrain the geometry of this basin. Bedding data in the La Ceja and Gilman-Ca\u00f1on area have a southerly dip and do not support an earlier phase of westward tilting of the basin \ufb02oor (Figs. 4, 6; Woodward et al., 1977; Connell et al., 1999). SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS Examination of stratigraphic relations in the southwestern Jemez Mountains and northern Albuquerque basin provides important evidence for the transition from Laramide compression to extension of the Rio Grande rift. Rocks assigned to the Zia and Abiquiu Formations are well exposed on the hanging wall of the Jemez fault zone at the southern \ufb02anks of the Jemez Moun- tains and Sierra Nacimiento. In the southwestern Jemez Moun- tains, the Zia Formation directly overlies well cemented tabular sandstone assigned to the Abiquiu Formation of Duchene et al. (1981). Tephra in the upper Abiquiu Formation constrain depo- sition of this underlying unit to early Miocene time (20.6 Ma). Mammalian fossils documented in the type area of the Piedra Parada Member of the Zia Formation indicate that deposition of the Zia Formation began at approximately 19 Ma. Description of drill-hole cuttings from the Tamara #1-Y well reveal a thick succession of (mostly) sand that sits between sub- jacent rocks of the Laramide Galisteo Formation and overlying rocks of the Zia Formation. These deposits are assigned to the unit of Isleta well #2 of Lozinsky (1994). Correlation of oil-test wells in the Albuquerque basin also reveals a thick pre-Piedra Parada stratigraphic succession that is assigned to the unit of Isleta well #2, which is not exposed in the Albuquerque basin. Near the northwestern structural margin of the basin, the bound- ary between the Galisteo and Zia formations is interpreted to rep- resent a disconformity that spans the time of the unit of Isleta well #2. The distribution of the unit of Isleta well #2 in the north- western Albuquerque basin supports a late Oligocene episode of faulting and erosion that occurred before deposition of the Piedra Parada Member of the Zia Formation.

Upper gravelly part of unit contains, in descending order of abundance, subangular to subrounded granite (30-50%), rounded, polished, multi-colored chert (30-40%), rounded volcanics (10-15%), and rounded white orthoquartzite (2-5%). 6.0 Abiquiu Formation, volcaniclastic conglomeratic sandstone (Tav, 56 m) 2c. Cobble conglomerate and pebbly sandstone: Medium-bedded pebbly sandstone. Contains large rounded andesite and basalt cobbles. Upper contact is sharp and possibly scoured, but overall the contact appears gradational to the east. 6.0 2b. Conglomeratic sandstone: Greenish-yellow (7.5YR 7/3) and yellow (2.5-5Y 6/4) pebbly sandstone. Many clasts have yellow to yellowish-green (5Y 7/8) clay coatings and stains, giving the unit a greenish-yellow color. Lower part of unit is crudely bedded; upper part is moderately bedded and contains very sparse (<1%) angular granite and pink feldspar. Basaltic clasts become more abundant near top. 18.0 2a. Conglomerate and conglomeratic sandstone: matrix-supported, vaguely bedded, pebble and cobble conglomerate and pebbly sandstone. No mudstone. 16.5 1c. Conglomerate: greenish-gray, poorly sorted, matrix-supported conglomerate and muddy sandstone. Contains abundant ~10-cm diameter weathered dacite clasts recognized as light-gray \u201cghosts.\u201d 3.0 1b. Conglomeratic sandstone: Poorly sorted, vaguely bedded, matrix supported, pebbly sandstone. Lower contact appears to be scoured into unit 1a. Gravel is dominantly rounded intermediate volcanic pebbles. 5.2-10 1a. Conglomeratic muddy sandstone: Pinkish-gray (5YR 7/6), poorly sorted, conglomeratic muddy sandstone with sparse scattered sandstone cobble lenses near base; abundant Permian sandstone pebbles and scattered cobbles, subangular granite, rounded intermediate volcanics, and sparse rounded orthoquartzite. Scoured basal contact at least 8.5 m into underlying Permian sandstone. 2.3 Abo Formation (Pay) 0. Sandstone: Red (10R 5/6), medium- to thick-bedded sandstone. 208 CONNELL, KONING, KELLEY, & BRANDES Tamara #1-Y. Summary of drill-hole cuttings from the Tamara #1-Y well (Figs. 6, 7). Stratigraphic top and deposit thickness are not corrected for stratal tilt, which would decrease values by a few to several meters at most. Colors are dry and described using Munsell (1992) notation. Top (ft, bls) [m, bls] Description Thickness (ft) [m] 0 [0] Arroyo Ojito Formation (To): very pale-brown (10YR 7/4), \ufb01ne- to medium-grained, quartz-rich to feldspathic sand with trace volcanic detritus of intermediate composition. No cuttings from 0-1180 ft (0- 360 m) bls. Lower 60 ft (18 m) of examined cuttings similar to Navajo Draw Mbr. 1240 [378] 1240 [378] Cerro Conejo Formation (Tcc): very pale-brown (10YR 7/3-7/4), \ufb01ne- to coarse-grained feldspathic sand with interbedded yellow to brownish-yellow (10YR 6/6-7/6) and light gray (10YR 7/2) sand. Contains frosted sand grains. Trace volcanic ash in 1330-1390 ft (405-424 m) interval may be correlative to tephra exposed to the east of well. Base contains reddish-yellow (7.5YR 6/6) clayey sand. 930 [283] 2170 [661] Zia Formation (Tz): very pale-brown to light-gray and yellow (10YR 7/2-7/6), medium- to coarse- grained, quartz-rich, feldspathic arenite with subrounded, frosted grains. Contains gray volcanic grains and granules of intermediate composition. Locally cemented with calcium-carbonate. No cuttings from 3600- 3760 ft (1097-1146 m) bls. 1590 [485] 3760 [1146] unit of Isleta well #2, upper subunit (Tisu): pink to very pale-brown (7.5-10YR 7/4), \ufb01ne-to medium- grained, quartz-rich, feldspathic arenite. Very similar to Cerro Conejo Fm in texture and composition. Sparse white, altered tephra and rhyolite(?) grains. 810 [247] 4570 [1393] unit of Isleta well #2, lower subunit (Tisl): reddish-yellow (5YR 7/4 to 7.5YR 6/6), medium-to coarse- grained feldspathic arenite. Calcium-carbonate cemented sandstone chips present. Lithic grains contain intermediate volcanic and hypabyssal intrusive, chert, and grayish tephra. 780 [238] 5350 [1631] Galisteo Formation (Tg): reddish-yellow to pink and light-gray to very pale-brown (5-7.5YR 6/6-7/6 and 7.5-10YR 7/2-7/4), medium- to coarse-grained lithic arenite (sandstone) and conglomeratic sandstone. Volcanic and subvolcanic granules and grains are sparse and probably introduced from caving of upper intervals. Gravel is granitic. 1140 [347] 6490 [1978] Menefee Formation (Mz): gray (5Y 6/1) siltstone with 5-10% coal. Cuttings not described below 6610 ft (2015 m) bls. ---"
