These reservoirs may be mobilized through land use change or natural stream channel migration which makes differ- entiating between anthropogenic and natural groundwater NO3 \u2212sources challenging. In this study, the fate and sources of NO3 \u2212were investigated in an area with multiple NO3 \u2212sources such as accidental sewer line releases and sewage la- goons as well as natural reservoirs of subsoil NO3 \u2212. To differentiate sources, this study used a large suite of geochemical tools including \u03b415N[NO3], \u03b418O[NO3], \u03b415N[N2], \u03b413C[DIC], 14C, tritium (3H), dissolved gas concentrations, major ion chemistry, and contaminants of emerging concern (CEC) including arti\ufb01cial sweeteners. NO3 \u2212at sites with the highest concentrations (25 to 229 mg/L NO3-N) were determined to be largely sourced from naturally occurring subsoil NO3 \u2212 based on \u03b415N[NO3] (<8 \u2030) and mass ratios of Cl\u2212/Br\u2212(\u2329100) and NO3 \u2212/Cl\u2212(>1.5). Anthropogenic NO3 \u2212was deciphered using mass ratios of Cl\u2212/Br\u2212(>120) and NO3 \u2212/Cl\u2212(<1), \u03b415N[NO3] (>8 \u2030), and CEC detections. Nitro- gen isotope analyses indicated that denitri\ufb01cation is fairly limited in the \ufb01eld area. CEC were detected at 67 % of sites including 3H dead sites (<1 pCi/L) with low percent modern carbon-14 (PMC; <30 %). Local supply wells are 3H dead with low PMC; as 3H does not re-equilibrate and 14C is very slow to re-equilibrate during recirculation through infra- structure, sites with low PMC, 3H < 1 pCi/L, and CEC detections were interpreted as locations with substantial anthro- pogenic groundwater recharge. Neotame was used to identify locations of very recent (<15 years before present) or ongoing wastewater in\ufb02uxes to the aquifer. This work shows the important in\ufb02uence of naturally occurring subsoil NO3 \u2212reservoirs on groundwater in arid regions and the major contribution of arti\ufb01cial recharge. 1. Introduction Nitrate (NO3 \u2212) is the most common groundwater contaminant globally (Spalding and Exner, 1993).

Excess NO3 \u2212in sur- face water and groundwater is largely due to the overuse of fertilizers and contamination by human and animal waste (Canter, 1996; Nolan et al., 2002). Natural NO3 \u2212sources such as atmospheric deposition, nitrogen (N) \ufb01xation in arid region soil crusts, termite mounds, and rock N can con- tribute a substantial amount of N in some watersheds (Houlton et al., 2018; Walvoord, 2010). In arid regions, large, naturally occurring NO3 \u2212reservoirs can occur in the subsoil, potentially a major source of NO3 \u2212to groundwater (Graham et al., 2008; Guti\u00e9rrez et al., 2018; Izbicki et al., 2015; Linhoff and Lunzer, 2021; B. Scanlon et al., 2008; Walvoord, 2010). In the American southwest, these reservoirs are generally the result of thousands of years of dry and wet atmospheric N deposition onto soils that have leached to the subsoil below plant root depth. Vadose zone NO3 \u2212deposits are suscep- tible to mobilization to underlying aquifers during land use or climate change, which can lead to excess groundwater NO3 \u2212(Linhoff and Lunzer, 2021; B. R. Scanlon et al., 2008; Walvoord et al., 2003). For mitigation of NO3 \u2212, sources must be identi\ufb01ed and the potential for denitri\ufb01cation\u2014the microbially mediated process whereby NO3 \u2212is ultimately transformed to N2\u2014should be assessed. Although there are many potential indicators of NO3 \u2212sources, successful discrimination is most likely if multiple tracers can be applied simultaneously. Isotopes of NO3 \u2212(\u03b415N [NO3] and \u03b418O [NO3]) can be used to identify manure and human waste, while examining dissolved gas concentrations (N2 and Ar) and isotopes (\u03b415N[N2]) can determine the extent of denitri\ufb01- cation (B\u00f6hlke et al., 2002). Analyzing both \u03b415N and \u03b418O in NO3 \u2212can help separate NO3 \u2212sources (B\u00f6ttcher et al., 1990). For example, the \u03b415N [NO3] of soil organic N (ON) is +3 \u2030 to +8 \u2030 while mineral fertilizers are between \u22128 \u2030 and +7 \u2030. While there is some overlap, measuring \u03b415N[NO3] can be especially helpful in identifying manure and human wastewater sources, which have values between +5 \u2030 to +35 \u2030 (Nikolenko et al., 2018). These differences result from microbially driven reactions such as assimilation, nitri\ufb01cation, and denitri\ufb01cation, which al- most always result in 15N enrichment of the substrate and depletion of the product (Nikolenko et al., 2018). \u1e9f18O[NO3] values in groundwater can also be indicative of NO3 \u2212sources and processes. For example, synthetic NO3 \u2212fertilizers, which are derived from atmospheric N2, have \u1e9f18O values close to atmospheric (+23.5 \u2030; Hollocher, 1984). During denitri\ufb01cation, \u1e9f18O[NO3] increases as denitrifying bacteria prefer the lighter O isotope leaving the residual heavier. During nitri\ufb01cation, one O atom from dis- solved O2 and two atoms from water are combined to form NO3 \u2212, hence \u1e9f18O[NO3] is controlled by nitri\ufb01cation, denitri\ufb01cation, and the \u1e9f18O value of the reactant water (Kendall and Aravena, 2000). Carbon isotope systems can be useful in estimating groundwater age and inferring groundwater sources, identifying recent recharge and areas vulnerable to contamination, and helping to differentiate between back- ground and anthropogenically impacted sites (Geyh, 2000; Grundl et al., 2013; Han and Plummer, 2016; Jasechko et al., 2017). Further analyzing C isotopes and associated major ion chemistry can also help determine whether bicarbonate (HCO3 \u2212) is sourced from carbonate mineral dissolu- tion or the oxidation of organic matter during O2 reduction or denitri\ufb01ca- tion (Han et al., 2012; Han and Plummer, 2016). Tritium (3H) is often used as an indicator of recently recharged groundwater (Lindsey et al., 2019). Concentrations of 3H in groundwater are affected by groundwater depth, timing of recharge relative to bomb 3H inputs (mainly between 1952 and 1963), and its half-life (12.32 years; Eastoe et al., 2012). Domestic and municipal wastewater may carry distinct chemical signa- tures such as high Cl\u2212/Br\u2212ratios (Davis et al., 1998). In general, domestic wastewater and municipal sewage has Cl\u2212/Br\u2212ratios between 300 and 1100 (by mass) while the Cl\u2212/Br\u2212ratio in non-impacted groundwater is typically"

Concentrations of 3H in groundwater are affected by groundwater depth, timing of recharge relative to bomb 3H inputs (mainly between 1952 and 1963), and its half-life (12.32 years; Eastoe et al., 2012). Domestic and municipal wastewater may carry distinct chemical signa- tures such as high Cl\u2212/Br\u2212ratios (Davis et al., 1998). In general, domestic wastewater and municipal sewage has Cl\u2212/Br\u2212ratios between 300 and 1100 (by mass) while the Cl\u2212/Br\u2212ratio in non-impacted groundwater is typically <100 (Davis et al., 1998; Katz et al., 2011). Because of the conser- vative nature of Cl\u2212and Br\u2212and the simplicity of using elemental ratios, Cl\u2212/Br\u2212ratios are often used as a \ufb01rst step to identify waters impacted by sewage ef\ufb02uent (Katz et al., 2011). The ratio of total nitrogen (TN) to Cl\u2212is typically ~11 (by mass) from bulk atmospheric deposition (National Atmospheric Deposition Program, 2022). Anthropogenic wastewater and fertilizers can contribute both Cl\u2212and NO3 \u2212with impacted groundwater generally having NO3 \u2212/Cl\u2212ratios <0.5 because by mass, more Cl\u2212is gen- erally contributed than NO3 \u2212(Sapek, 2002; Stites and Kraft, 2001). It should be noted that as NO3 \u2212is subject to redox reactions, care must be taken when interpreting NO3 \u2212/Cl\u2212ratios as changes along a \ufb02ow path may be due to denitri\ufb01cation (Lowrance, 1992). Contaminants of emerging concern (CEC)\u2014arti\ufb01cial sweeteners, phar- maceuticals, and wastewater indicators (WWI)\u2014are useful as tracers of an- thropogenic NO3 \u2212sources and serve as tracers of post-industrial revolution aquifer recharge (McCance et al., 2018). Arti\ufb01cial sweeteners are also in- creasingly being recognized as pollutants and may result in substantial ecotoxicity (Luo et al., 2019). Since saccharin was \ufb01rst discovered in 1879 (Fahlberg and Remsen, 1879), arti\ufb01cial sweeteners have become widely popular globally as sugar substitutes used in food, beverages, phar- maceuticals, personal care products, and even animal feed (Buerge et al., 2009; Gan et al., 2013; Van Stempvoort et al., 2011). Their usefulness in groundwater studies stems from their typically highly recalcitrant behavior making them suitable tracers of anthropogenic waste (Buerge et al., 2009; Robertson et al., 2016). This stability in the environment varies between sweeteners with acesulfame-K generally being the most persistent (Buerge et al., 2009) while sucralose, aspartame, and neotame degrade more readily (Margot et al., 2015). In the United States, neotame was approved for consumption in 2002, acesulfame-K in 1988, sucralose in 1998, and saccharin in 1879 (U.S. Food and Drug Administration, 2018). Hence, their presence in groundwater can help better constrain the timeline of contamination. Human-use pharmaceuticals are also widely distributed in groundwater and surface waters and can serve as additional tracers of anthropogenic water sources and recent groundwa- ter recharge (Bex\ufb01eld et al., 2019; Glassmeyer et al., 2008; Richardson and Ternes, 2011). Many of these compounds are present in both do- mestic wastewater and in ef\ufb02uent from wastewater treatment facilities because treatments are often not designed to remove these compounds (Vidal\u2010Dorsch et al., 2012). This work uses major ion ratios, dissolved gases, stable and radio- active isotopes, and a wide variety of CEC to differentiate NO3 \u2212sources in the impacted aquifers in and around KAFB. With a few exceptions (e.g. McCance et al., 2020, this breadth of techniques has rarely been used to separate NO3 \u2212sources. Due to the extent of analyses, this work provides an opportunity to compare techniques in understanding NO3 \u2212impacted aquifers. 2. Study area Arroyos\u2014dry creek beds in the American Southwest that \ufb02ow after suf- \ufb01cient rainfall\u2014were recently discovered to contain unusually large reser- voirs of subsoil NO3 \u2212in their \ufb02oodplains (Linhoff and Lunzer, 2021). Linhoff and Lunzer (2021) describe large NO3 \u2212subsoil reservoirs (10,000\u201338,000 kg NO3-N/ha) in an arroyo \ufb02oodplain on Kirtland Air Force Base (KAFB) near Albuquerque, New Mexico, USA (Figs. 1 and S1). Nitrate accumulation in the arroyo \ufb02oodplain is attributed to the evapora- tion of water in\ufb01ltrating the arroyo channel sediments, and the lateral movement and evaporation of water through subsoils from beneath the ar- royo channel to the surrounding \ufb02oodplain. Enhanced nitri\ufb01cation during wetting and drying in the arroyo channel (G\u00f3mez et al., 2012) and high NO3 \u2212/Cl\u2212ratios (~11 by mass) measured in atmospheric deposition may account for the very high NO3 \u2212/Cl\u2212ratios (5\u201330) measured in subsoil porewaters in the \ufb02oodplain (Linhoff and Lunzer, 2021). Based on model- ing, this process of naturally accumulating NO3 \u2212in the subsoils of the \ufb02ood- plain was estimated to occur in 200 to 800 years or eight to 75 times faster than through atmospheric deposition alone. Arroyo channel migration across the \ufb02oodplain\u2014a process that can be observed in historical satellite photos occurring on decadal timescales (Linhoff and Lunzer, 2021)\u2014likely periodically \ufb02ushes the arroyo \ufb02oodplain subsoil NO3 \u2212to the underlying aquifers. Subsequent water \ufb02ows through the arroyo channel and B. Linhoff Science of the Total Environment 848 (2022) 157345 2 evaporation in subsoils in the \ufb02oodplain likely act to regenerate NO3 \u2212 deposits over the course of hundreds of years. Hence, arroyo \ufb02oodplains should be considered as potential NO3 \u2212sources to groundwater in arid regions. Though NO3 \u2212contamination of groundwater is generally less likely in arid regions with thick unsaturated zones (Nolan et al., 2002), elevated groundwater NO3 \u2212is widespread in northern and central New Mexico (Linhoff et al., 2016; McQuillan, 2004). In particular, NO3 \u2212contamination in the aquifer beneath KAFB is a major concern (Copland, 2019). In addi- tion to subsoil NO3 \u2212reservoirs in arroyo \ufb02oodplains, numerous anthropo- genic sources of nitrate have been identi\ufb01ed on and around KAFB including land\ufb01lls, sewer line releases, and former leach \ufb01elds (Fig. 1; Oneida Total Integrated Enterprises, 2014). A historic neighborhood on the northeast border of KAFB was not connected to municipal sewer sys- tems until relatively recently and hence, there may be former septic leach \ufb01elds and tanks that could be an off-base NO3 \u2212source to KAFB.

In particular, NO3 \u2212contamination in the aquifer beneath KAFB is a major concern (Copland, 2019). In addi- tion to subsoil NO3 \u2212reservoirs in arroyo \ufb02oodplains, numerous anthropo- genic sources of nitrate have been identi\ufb01ed on and around KAFB including land\ufb01lls, sewer line releases, and former leach \ufb01elds (Fig. 1; Oneida Total Integrated Enterprises, 2014). A historic neighborhood on the northeast border of KAFB was not connected to municipal sewer sys- tems until relatively recently and hence, there may be former septic leach \ufb01elds and tanks that could be an off-base NO3 \u2212source to KAFB. West of KAFB in the \ufb02oodplain of Tijeras Arroyo (Fig. 1), extremely high groundwater NO3 \u2212concentrations (>100 mg/L NO3-N) have been observed in Albuquerque's Mountain View community (Mohr, 2009; Thomson and McQuillan, 1984). These high NO3 \u2212concentrations re- sulted in one case of methemoglobinemia prior to the community being connected to municipal water supply (Mohr, 2009; Thomson and McQuillan, 1984). While the anthropogenic NO3 \u2212sources in and around KAFB are numerous, high NO3 \u2212in groundwaters beneath the ar- royo \ufb02oodplain on KAFB tend to have NO3 \u2212/Cl\u2212ratios far higher than background sites and low Cl\u2212/Br\u2212ratios suggesting a subsoil NO3 \u2212 source (Linhoff and Lunzer, 2021). The majority of groundwater samples collected for this study were from aquifers of the Santa Fe Group (Fig. S1), a thick (~2.7 km) basin-\ufb01ll sediment sequence that formed in the late Oligocene to middle Pleistocene; it consists of piedmont-slope and \ufb02uvial basin-\ufb02oor deposits derived from the surround- ing uplifts (Haase and Lozinsky, 1995). The study area is bisected by multiple north-south trending faults that are part of the Tijeras Fault Complex. These faults are generally parallel to the mountain block on the eastern side of the Rio Grande Valley. Several springs\u2014sampled for this study\u2014are associated with these faults including Hell Canyon Tank and Hubble Spring (Fig. 1), both of which may contain groundwater from the Santa Fe Group aquifers or deeper groundwater (Haase and Lozinsky, 1995). Two aquifers exist within the upper Santa Fe Group, a perched sys- tem and the regional aquifer (Copland, 2017). The perched aquifer system has an extent of ~9 km2, largely within KAFB (Fig. 1); the perching layer consists of multiple lenses of alluvial-fan clay and silt. Vertical groundwater \ufb02ow is minimal because of lenticular clay units; groundwater \ufb02ow direction in the perched system is generally to the southeast. The perched system merges with the regional aquifer at its southeastern extent (Fig. S1). Flow through the \ufb02oodplain is generally from the east to the west moving downhill from the mountain front to the Rio Grande. Prior to World War II, the perched aquifer likely only contained minimal water (Copland, 2017). When KAFB and Sandia National Laboratory (located within KAFB) began operations in 1941, various anthropogenic inputs including sewage impoundments, septic leach \ufb01elds, outfall ditches, landscape watering, leaking water lines, and a golf course likely increased in\ufb01ltration and created or enhanced the perched aquifer (Copland, 2017). Prior to large scale regional aquifer withdrawals in the City of Albuquer- que, groundwater \ufb02ow directions in the regional aquifer were north to south, with a westward \ufb02ow direction near the mountain-front boundaries to the east (Bex\ufb01eld and Anderholm, 2002; Plummer et al., 2012). However, groundwater pumping by the City of Albuquerque and to a lesser extent KAFB, has altered groundwater \ufb02ow directions and now groundwater gener- ally \ufb02ows to the west and northwest through KAFB (Galanter and Curry, 2019) with signi\ufb01cant recharge around the KAFB golf course and east of the West Sandia Fault (Copland, 2017). Notably, while the regional ground- water \ufb02ow is generally towards the west and northwest, groundwater in the perched system moves in the opposite direction towards the southeast (Copland, 2017). 3. Methods 3.1. Collection of groundwater and surface water samples Fifty-\ufb01ve sites were sampled for this study including two streams, one ephemeral stream, three springs, and 49 groundwater sites (Tables 1 and S1). Sampling locations were chosen to be spatially representative of groundwater and surface water within the study area and cover regions with elevated and low nitrate concentrations. Across the study area, 35 samples were collected from the regional Santa Fe Group aquifer. In addi- tion to 22 samples on KAFB collected in the regional aquifer, nine samples were collected in the perched aquifer and one sample, (TJA-4), was col- lected in the mixing zone above the regional aquifer and beneath the perched aquifer. KAFB-0615 on the eastern side of KAFB and EGC-01 and EGC-17 east of KAFB were collected in the fractured granite mountain- front aquifer. To provide comparison, background sites located on the east- ern portion of Isleta Pueblo Reservation (ASL PD and UES-4) were sampled as there is no known source of anthropogenic nitrate to these sites. All sites sampled on Isleta Pueblo were on rangeland used for grazing cattle. All sites were sampled once except for the ephemeral stream Tijeras Arroyo which was sampled four times following rainfall events. Details of surface water and groundwater collection methods are described in S.1, and quality assur- ance and control samples are described in S.2. 3.2. Major element and nitrogen species analyses All samples collected were analyzed for nitrogen species and major ele- ment composition (Tables 1 and S2). These samples were stored at 4 \u00b0C until analysis. Samples for nitrogen species\u2014organic nitrogen (ON), NH3 \u00b0 + NH4 +, NO2 \u2212, and NO3 \u2212\u2014were \ufb01ltered to 0.45 \u03bcm and collected in 125 mL brown polyethylene bottles before being analyzed within 30 days of col- lection. NH3\u00b0 + NH4 +, NO2 \u2212, NO3 \u2212were measured through colorimetric de- terminative methods while ON were measured using titrimetric digestion- distillation methods (Fishman, 1993; Patton and Kryskalla, 2011). Samples collected for major cations were \ufb01ltered to 0.45 \u03bcm, acidi\ufb01ed to pH < 2, and stored chilled until analysis using inductively coupled plasma mass spec- trometry (Fishman, 1993). Major anion samples were \ufb01ltered to 0.45 \u03bcm and chilled until analysis using ion-exchange chromatography (Fishman, 1993). Carbonate species (H2CO3, HCO3 \u2212, and CO3 2\u2212) were inferred from \ufb01eld alkalinity titrations.

Samples for nitrogen species\u2014organic nitrogen (ON), NH3 \u00b0 + NH4 +, NO2 \u2212, and NO3 \u2212\u2014were \ufb01ltered to 0.45 \u03bcm and collected in 125 mL brown polyethylene bottles before being analyzed within 30 days of col- lection. NH3\u00b0 + NH4 +, NO2 \u2212, NO3 \u2212were measured through colorimetric de- terminative methods while ON were measured using titrimetric digestion- distillation methods (Fishman, 1993; Patton and Kryskalla, 2011). Samples collected for major cations were \ufb01ltered to 0.45 \u03bcm, acidi\ufb01ed to pH < 2, and stored chilled until analysis using inductively coupled plasma mass spec- trometry (Fishman, 1993). Major anion samples were \ufb01ltered to 0.45 \u03bcm and chilled until analysis using ion-exchange chromatography (Fishman, 1993). Carbonate species (H2CO3, HCO3 \u2212, and CO3 2\u2212) were inferred from \ufb01eld alkalinity titrations. All nutrient and major element analyses were completed at the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) National Water Quality Laboratory in Lakewood, CO. 3.3. Contaminants of emerging concern methods Thirty-eight samples were measured for WWI chemicals including 69 compounds typically found in domestic and industrial wastewater, includ- ing the alkylphenol ethoxylate nonionic surfactants and their degradates, food additives, fragrances, antioxidants, \ufb02ame retardants, plasticizers, in- dustrial solvents, disinfectants, fecal sterols, polycyclic aromatic hydrocar- bons, and high-use domestic pesticides (Table S3). Additionally, 36 samples were measured for 110 common human-use pharmaceutical com- pounds (Table S3). These include common drugs such as Metformin, Acet- aminophen, Carbamazepine, and Albuterol. Sample collection for pharmaceutical and WWI samples followed USGS guidelines outlined in Section 5.6.1F of the USGS National Field Manual (USGS, variously dated). Brie\ufb02y, pharmaceutical samples were \ufb01ltered to 0.7 \u03bcm and collected in 20-mL amber glass, stored at 1\u20135 \u00b0C in the dark, then analyzed within nine days of collection. Pharmaceuticals were mea- sured through direct injection into a high-performance liquid chromato- graph coupled to a triple-quadrupole tandem mass spectrometer using an electrospray ionization source operated in the positive ion mode (Furlong et al., 2014). WWI compounds were analyzed from whole un\ufb01ltered water samples collected in baked 1-L amber glass bottles. These samples were extracted within 14 days of collection and analyzed through liquid- B. Linhoff Science of the Total Environment 848 (2022) 157345 3 B. Linhoff Science of the Total Environment 848 (2022) 157345 4 liquid extraction and capillary-column gas chromatography/mass spec- trometry (Zaugg et al., 2006). All samples collected were analyzed for arti\ufb01cial sweeteners (Table S3); arti\ufb01cial sweetener analyses were completed on \ufb01ltered (0.45 \u03bcm) water. Each sample was split into \ufb01ve 125-mL amber glass bottles, \ufb01lled halfway, and frozen following sample collection. Arti\ufb01cial sweetener samples were analyzed at the USGS Organic Geochemistry Research Laboratory in Lawrence, KS. Analysis was performed using solid-phase extraction and ultra-performance liquid chromatography/ tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC/MS/MS) with electrospray ioniza- tion using multiple reaction monitoring. Details of arti\ufb01cial sweetener analyses can be found in S.3. Details of data censoring and blank results for other CECs are presented in Table S4 and S.4 and S.5. 3.4. Dissolved gas concentration Forty-eight groundwater samples were analyzed for dissolved N2, argon (Ar), methane (CH4), and O2 gas using a Hewlett Packard model 7890B gas chromatograph (Table S5). These samples were collected in pre-weighed 150-mL septum bottles. For preservation of bioactive constituents, potas- sium hydroxide was added to the bottles to increase pH to >10. Sample dis- charge tubing, \ufb02owing at a rate of ~1 L/min, was placed at the bottom of the 150-mL sample bottles and allowed to cycle water for one minute; bot- tles were submerged in a 4-L bucket over\ufb02owing with raw water during collection. After ensuring no bubbles were trapped inside of the bottle, the bottle was sealed underwater with a needle through the septum. Sam- ples were collected in duplicate, stored on ice, and shipped overnight in coolers to the USGS Reston Groundwater Dating Laboratory. Details of laboratory analyses of dissolved gases can be found in S.6. 3.5. Isotopic analyses of nitrate and nitrogen gas Fifty-four samples analyzed for \u03b415N[NO3] and \u03b418O[NO3] were \ufb01ltered to 0.2 \u03bcm and collected in 125-mL polyethylene bottles (Table 1). Samples were placed on ice and immediately shipped to the USGS Stable Isotope Laboratory to be analyzed. For analysis, dissolved NO3 \u2212was converted to nitrous oxide (N2O) by denitrifying bacteria (Pseudomonas aureofaciens) and the N2O was analyzed for N and O isotopic abundance by continuous-\ufb02ow isotopic-ratio mass spectrometry (Sigman et al., 2001). The isotopic composition of dissolved N2 was determined for 45 groundwa- ter samples by gas chromatograph separation and continuous \ufb02ow isotope ratio mass spectrometry on headspace gas leftover after gas chromatograph analysis of dissolved gas concentrations. N isotope ratios are reported in per mil (\u2030) relative to N2 in air (Mariotti, 1983). Oxygen isotope ratios are re- ported in \u2030 relative to VSMOW reference water and normalized on a scale such that SLAP reference water is \u221255.5 \u2030 (Coplen, 1994). International reference materials were analyzed with samples and reported data were normalized in accordance with B\u00f6hlke and Coplen (1995) as described in Table 1. Two-sigma uncertainty for N isotopic results in samples with NO3 \u2212concentrations >0.06 mg/L as N was \u00b10.5 \u2030 while samples with concentrations <0.06 mg/L as N was \u00b11 \u2030. 3.6. Excess N2 calculation As denitri\ufb01cation occurs, excess N2 is produced. Fig. 2A shows Ar and N2 concentrations in groundwater samples along the expected concentra- tions from air saturated water between 5 and 25 \u00b0C (Weiss, 1970) at the mean elevation of sample collection (1651 m; Weiss, 1970). Samples that fall to the right of the line either contain excess air or excess N2. As denitri- \ufb01cation is an anoxic process, excess N2 from denitri\ufb01cation is more likely at sites with low O2 concentrations (B\u00f6hlke, 2002). To estimate the amount of excess N2 produced through denitri\ufb01cation the USGS Reston Groundwater Dating Laboratory Ar-N2 workbook (https://water.usgs.gov/lab/dissolved-gas/) is used. Brie\ufb02y, excess N2 is estimated by using the concentrations of N2 and Ar, their solubility in water at the likely recharge elevation (assumed to be the mean elevation of sample sites; Weiss, 1970), atmospheric pressure and the likely recharge temperature. The method assumes that the only source of Ar is the atmo- sphere, the only sources of N2 are the atmosphere and denitri\ufb01cation, and excess air is not fractionated. It is further assumed that all samples were recharged at the same temperature but with varying amounts of excess air. For the"

It is further assumed that all samples were recharged at the same temperature but with varying amounts of excess air. For the assumed groundwater recharge temperature, the apparent re- charge temperature 17 \u00b0C observed in Fig. 2A is used. For this analysis, only sites with O2 concentrations <4 mg/L are considered. The original NO3 \u2212concentrations prior to denitri\ufb01cation are then calcu- lated by mass balance by Eq. (1): NO3 \u00bd \u0002 \u0003 \u00bc NO3 \u00bd \u0002 \u00fe 2 N2,denit \u0001 \u0003 (1) where [NO3]\u00b0 is the initial NO3 \u2212concentration (in molar units), [NO3] is the measured NO3 \u2212concentration and N2,denit is the estimated excess N2. Reac- tion progress f (Table S6) was estimated by Eq. (2): f \u00bc 2 N2;1denit \u0001 \u0003 NO3 \u00bd \u0002 \u00b0 \u00f02\u00de Initial \u03b415N[NO3]\u00b0 values were calculated to determine the original iso- topic composition of sites prior to any denitri\ufb01cation that may have oc- curred following recharge. At sites where denitri\ufb01cation was suspected, calculations detailed in Green et al. (2008) were used to determine \u03b415N [NO3]\u00b0. Carbon isotope analysis can help elucidate what denitri\ufb01cation path- way is occurring. Both oxic respiration (Eq. (3)) and heterotrophic denitri- \ufb01cation (Eq. (4)) result in the production of bicarbonate (HCO3 \u2212). O2 \u00fe 0:5C2H3O\u2212 2 \u21920:5H\u00fe \u00fe HCO\u2212 3 \u00f03\u00de 0:6H\u00fe \u00fe 0:8NO\u2212 3 \u00fe 0:5C2H3O\u2212 2 \u21920:4N2 \u00fe HCO\u2212 3 \u00fe 0:2H2O \u00f04\u00de Hence, if NO3 \u2212reduction is occurring along with oxidation of organic material, then HCO3 \u2212and NO3 \u2212concentrations should be impacted along with C and N isotopes. The oxidation of organic material to inorganic car- bon will produce very negative \u1e9f13C values in dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) whereas the dissolution of carbonate minerals will lead to near zero \u1e9f13C values in DIC (Nikolenko et al., 2018). By contrast, autotrophic deni- tri\ufb01cation, uses zero-valent iron, ferrous iron, elemental sulfur or reduced sulfur compounds such as pyrite as an electron donor. 3.7. Carbon isotopes and 3H analyses Seventeen sites were selected for 14C and \u1e9f13C analysis (Tables 1 and S7) of DIC and 3H. Samples for carbon isotopes were collected using a 1-L plastic coated glass bottle \ufb01tted with a polyseal cone cap. Bottles were \ufb01lled from the bottom allowing bottles to over\ufb02ow three sample volumes with \ufb01ltered water (0.45 \u03bcm) and then capped immediately with no head space. Bottle tops were additionally sealed with electrical tape before being chilled. Sam- ples were chilled, stored in the dark and analyzed within three months by accelerator mass spectrometry at the National Ocean Sciences Accelerator Mass Spectrometry (NOSAMS) facility at Woods Hole Oceanographic Insti- tution (https://www2.whoi.edu/site/nosams/). The percent modern 14C (PMC) is the deviation of the 14C/12C ratio of a sample from modern as de\ufb01ned as 95 % of radiocarbon concentration in AD 1950 of NBS Oxalic Acid (SRM 4990B, OX-1) and then normalized to \u1e9f13CVPDB = \u221219 Fig. 1.

Analyses were completed at the Tritium Laboratory at the University of Miami using gas proportional counting (https://tritium.rsmas.miami.edu/). 3H was measured through in- ternal gas proportional counting of H2 gas made from the water sample. Prior to analyses, samples underwent an electrolytic enrichment step during which 3H concentrations are increased through volume reduction. Accuracy was 0.3 pCi/L or 3.5 %, whichever was greater. 4. Results Key results from the study are presented in Table 1; all data are available in Table S3 and in the USGS National Water Information System database (U. S. Geological Survey, 2022) by using the site identi\ufb01ers presented in Table S1. 4.1. Ion concentrations and \u03b415N [NO3], \u03b418O [NO3], and \u03b415N [N2] results Results of N species as well as Cl\u2212and Br\u2212concentrations are shown in Table S2. Dissolved NO3 \u2212concentrations varied between below the detec- tion limit to 229 mg/L (NO3-N) with a mean of 19.4 mg/L (n = 56). Of the groundwater sites sampled (n = 49), 22 concentrations exceeded the EPA maximum contaminant level (MCL) for NO3 \u2212(>10 mg/L NO3-N). Reduced species of N including ON, ammonia and ammonium (NH3and NH4 +) and nitrite (NO2 \u2212) were detected at 12 sites. On KAFB, sites with re- duced N species were in the northeast side of the \ufb01eld area (ST105MW015, ST105MW017, and KAFB-0901) and KAFB-106009 which is situated be- neath a recent accidental sewer line release (Fig. 1). Table 1 has results from \u03b415N [NO3], \u03b418O [NO3], and \u03b415N [N2] analyses. \u03b415N[NO3] varied from 4.3 \u2030 to 16.2 \u2030 (mean = 6.9 \u2030, n = 54), \u03b418O[NO3] varied from \u22125.9 \u2030 to 12.3 \u2030 (mean = 3.8 \u2030, n = 54), and \u03b415N[N2] varied be- tween \u22120.83 \u2030 and 2.40 \u2030 (mean = 0.79 \u2030, n = 45), respectively. 4.2.

The highest f value (31 %) was observed at KAFB-106009 where 4.5 mg/L of excess N2 was produced and [NO3]\u00b0 and \u03b415N [NO3]\u00b0 were estimated to be 14.7 mg/L and 9.5 \u2030, respectively (compared to the measured NO3-N and \u03b415N [NO3] values of 10.2"

Five sites had excess N2 likely from denitri\ufb01cation (KAFB- 106009, MVMW-B-1, ST105MW015, MP1W-01, RIMW-01S; Fig. 2A; Table S6). The highest f value (31 %) was observed at KAFB-106009 where 4.5 mg/L of excess N2 was produced and [NO3]\u00b0 and \u03b415N [NO3]\u00b0 were estimated to be 14.7 mg/L and 9.5 \u2030, respectively (compared to the measured NO3-N and \u03b415N [NO3] values of 10.2 and 15.8 \u2030, respec- tively). ST105MW015 also had a relatively high calculated f value of 28 %. At this site, estimated [NO3]\u00b0 was 12.6 mg/L NO3-N, \u03b415N[NO3]\u00b0 was 6.5 \u2030 and 3.5 mg/L of excess N2 was produced. As the measured NO3 \u2212 concentrations were 9.06 mg/L NO3-N at ST105MW015, denitri\ufb01cation appears to have lowered NO3 \u2212concentrations to below the EPA's MCL. To test the reality of excess N2 calculations, excess N2 was plotted against O2 concentration; higher excess N2 should correspond to lower O2 concentrations and higher \u03b415N [NO3] values. Fig. S2 shows that generally this is the case with sites with low O2 having elevated \u03b415N [NO3] and ex- cess N2. Sites with higher O2 concentrations (>4 mg/L) likely have not un- dergone any denitri\ufb01cation which explains the scatter around zero excess N2 in Fig. S2 at high O2 sites. The standard deviation of excess N2 at sites with >4 mg/L O2 (Fig. S2) was used as an estimate of uncertainty. Using this method, excess N2 uncertainty was \u00b11.4 mg/L. A trend was observed of decreasing \u03b413C[DIC] with increasing HCO3 \u2212 concentrations (Fig. S3) that is consistent with heterotrophic denitri\ufb01ca- tion. Additionally, NO3 \u2212reduction will cause the fractionation of \u1e9f15N. Fig. S3 shows a general increase in both HCO3 \u2212and \u1e9f15N[NO3]. Assuming the reduction of 0.3 mmol of O2, 0.3 mmol (18.5 mg/L) of HCO3 \u2212will be produced through Eq. 3. Using the estimated excess N2 (Table S6) for sites with <0.14 mmol/L (5 mg/L) O2, an additional 1.7\u201353 mg/L HCO3 \u2212 was produced according to Eq. (4). Table S6 shows the estimated HCO3 \u2212 produced from NO3 \u2212and O2 reduction. This is enough to explain the in- crease in HCO3 \u2212with increasing \u1e9f15N shown in Fig. S3. 4.3. Contaminants of emerging concern results In total, 44 different CECs were detected in groundwater and surface water sites. At least one CEC (including arti\ufb01cial sweeteners) was found in 67 % of sites sampled for these constituents. The number of different sites each CEC was detected at is listed in Table S8. The surface water site Tijeras Arroyo had the highest number of detectable CEC with between 5 and 30 detected in each sampling event. CEC were also found in all other surface water sampling sites. Of the 38 sites where both WWI and arti\ufb01cial sweeteners were measured, only \ufb01ve had no detections. These included KAFB-0315 (northeast KAFB), KAFB-0510 (northwest KAFB), KAFB-0621 (northeast KAFB), KAFB-6241 (southeast KAFB), and TJA-3 (central KAFB). Exceedances included four sites with tetrachloroethylene over the EPA's maximum contaminant level (MCL) goal (0 \u03bcg/L; EPA, 2021) located in both the perched aquifer on KAFB (KAFB-0623, ST105MW006) and in the Mountain View community (MP1W-01, RIMW-01S). Additionally, benzo(a)pyrene was found in the surface water Tijeras Arroyo above the EPA MCL (0.2 \u03bcg/L; EPA, 2021). Of all sites sampled, 21 had measurable detections of arti\ufb01cial sweet- eners (Table S9 and Fig. S4). Neotame was the most detected sweetener (n = 12) followed by saccharin (n = 4), acesulfame-K (n = 2), aspartame (n = 1), and sucralose (n = 0). Concentrations ranged from 0.3 to 11 ng/L for neotame, 19 to 630 ng/L for saccharin, 840 to 11,000 for acesulfame-K, and 1.6 ng/L for aspartame. Pharmaceuticals were generally not detected in groundwater with the ex- ception of a domestic well in Carnuel that contained Fluconazole (antifungal) and Carbamazepine (anticonvulsant). In the Tijeras Arroyo surface water site, Metformin (anti-diabetic) and Acetaminophen (pain killer) were detected along with the human-use products cotinine (a byproduct of nicotine), nicotine, and caffeine. 4.4. Dissolved gas results Four sites had detectable CH4 (Abandoned Chical, ST105MW015, KAFB-0619; and KAFB-106009) which varied between 0.0026 and 9.7 mg/L (mean 2.4, n = 4; Table S5). Dissolved N2 concentrations varied between 12.7 and 29.9 mg/L (mean = 16, n = 47). Out of the 47 sites sampled, \ufb01ve sites had low O2 concentrations (<2 mg/L; KAFB-106009, Abandoned Chical, RWP19, MWMW-B1, KAFB-0618). Dissolved Ar varied between 0.4 and 0.8 mg/L with a mean of 0.5 mg/L (n = 47). 4.5. Carbon isotopes and 3H results Carbon isotope results are displayed on Tables 1 and S7. \u03b413C in groundwaters varied between \u221221.5 and \u22123.61 \u2030 while the median \u03b413C value was \u22127.62 \u2030 (n = 17; Table 1). 14C results varied from 15 to 105 PMC with a median of 52 (n = 17). Detailed analysis of 14C isotopes (S.7) show that no sites sampled had datable pre-modern groundwater. However, low 14C values in water from some sites are likely components of recent recharge and intermediate waters where old ground- water is mixing with relatively recent recharge (S.7).

Differentiating natural and anthropogenic NO3 \u2212using major ions In the study area, Cl\u2212/Br\u2212ratios (by mass) varied between 29 and 414 (Table 1; mean = 108, n = 54). Fig. 3, showing Cl\u2212/Br\u2212ratios against Cl\u2212 concentrations, indicates the hypothetical mixing line (dashed line) be- tween non-impacted groundwaters and sewer or septic wastewater sources. The highest Cl\u2212/Br\u2212ratio was observed in Tijeras Creek (Fig. 3), a small perennial creek that turns into Tijeras Arroyo downstream at lower eleva- tions prior to entering KAFB (Fig. 4). The Tijeras Creek site is in the commu- nity of Carnuel (far east in Fig. 4), which has long been impacted by elevated NO3 \u2212in groundwater likely due to domestic septic leach \ufb01elds (Bartolino et al., 2005). The EGC sites 1 and 17 are also in Carnuel and sim- ilarly have elevated Cl\u2212/Br\u2212ratios as well as CEC detections (arti\ufb01cial Fig. 2. Plot A shows Ar and N2 concentrations of samples and their corresponding O2 content. Also shown is air-saturated water (solid line) in equilibrium with different temperatures at the mean elevation of collected samples (1651 m). Additionally, arrows are plotted showing the pathway of groundwater mixing with excess air and estimated excess N2 of samples where NO3 \u2212reduction was suspected. Plot B shows the relationship between and \u03b418O[NO3] vs. \u03b415N[NO3] isotopes and dissolved oxygen (O2) concentrations. Eight sites had a composition consistent with a manure or septic waste source. The arrow shows the isotopic progression of denitri\ufb01cation (slope is generally between 1:1 and 1:2). Plot C shows that the highest NO3 \u2212concentrations were not associated with a clear manure or septic source. Plot D shows a correlation between Cl\u2212/Br\u2212mass ratios and \u03b415N [NO3] suggesting wastewater is partially driving \u03b415N[NO3] values. Plot E shows that elevated the NO3 \u2212/Cl\u2212mass ratio\u2014 associated with vadose zone NO3 \u2212reservoirs\u2014is not correlated to high \u03b415N [NO3]. In all \ufb01gures, at sites where excess N2 was detected, initial \u03b415N[NO3]\u00b0 values are used. B. Linhoff Science of the Total Environment 848 (2022) 157345 8 sweeteners neotame and acesulfame-K and pharmaceuticals \ufb02uconazole and carbamazepine). These high Cl\u2212/Br\u2212ratios and CECs are likely the re- sult of septic contaminated groundwater that discharges to Tijeras Creek. On KAFB, sites with relatively high Cl\u2212/Br\u2212ratios include KAFB-0516, KAFB-0517, KAFB-0510, KAFB-0903, and ST105MW003. Except for KAFB- 0510, all these sites are located on the \ufb02oodplain of Tijeras Arroyo. Pulling from the regional aquifer, KAFB-0516, KAFB-0517, and ST105MW003 are located near past accidental sewer line releases that occurred in 1994, 2003, and 2013 (Copland, 2019) on the western margins of the base while KAFB-0903 is located upstream on the eastern edge of KAFB near for- mer land\ufb01lls and housing development (Figs. 1 and 4). Downstream, the Montessa Site is located ~1 km west of KAFB in the Tijeras Arroyo \ufb02ood- plain (Figs. 1 and 4). This site may be impacted by a nearby (<0.25 km) former land\ufb01ll used for sludge disposal of Albuquerque's wastewater treat- ment facility (Agency, 1981). Other sites with elevated Cl\u2212/Br\u2212ratios include MVMW-B1 in the Mountain Valley neighborhood located down- stream (west) of KAFB in the Tijeras Arroyo \ufb02oodplain. Other sites with relatively high Cl\u2212/Br\u2212ratios include the Abandoned Chical well and RWP19 on Isleta Pueblo (Fig. 3). Based on Cl\u2212/Br\u2212ratios, wastewater appears to be reaching groundwa- ter in parts of the \ufb01eld area including beneath Tijeras Arroyo on KAFB (Fig. 4). However, the recently discovered large subsoil NO3 \u2212reservoir in the \ufb02oodplain of Tijeras Arroyo on KAFB clearly plays a major role in NO3 \u2212 chemistry (Linhoff and Lunzer, 2021). Notably, the highest groundwater NO3 \u2212concentrations were not associated with high (>100) Cl\u2212/Br\u2212ratios but instead, very high NO3 \u2212(>20 mg/L NO3-N) corresponded to high NO3 \u2212/Cl\u2212(>1.5) and low Cl\u2212/Br\u2212(<65) ratios (Fig. 5). These sites were all located on the \ufb02oodplain of Tijeras Arroyo except for RWP1, which is in the \ufb02oodplain of Hell Canyon Arroyo (a large arroyo ~14 km to the south of KAFB; Figs. 1 and 4). Subsoil porewater in the \ufb02oodplain of Tijeras Arroyo is associated with very low porewater Cl\u2212/Br\u2212(15 to 83, mean = 41) and very high NO3 \u2212/Cl\u2212(0.1 to 30, mean = 6.6) ratios (Linhoff and Lunzer, 2021). Consequently, at this \ufb01eld site, NO3 \u2212in groundwater sourced from the vadose zone NO3 \u2212should have low Cl\u2212/Br\u2212and high NO3 \u2212/Cl\u2212ratios in contrast with anthropogenic NO3 \u2212sources. For example, RIM-06S, located in the Tijeras Arroyo \ufb02oodplain (Fig. 1), had a clear subsoil NO3 \u2212source based on major element ratios with exceptionally high NO3 \u2212concentrations (113 mg/L NO3-N), low Cl\u2212/Br\u2212(46) and high NO3 \u2212/Cl\u2212(3.9) ratios. It did however contain three CECs which may have been sourced from a high- way 50 m away. Based on this evidence, the presence of CECs alone cannot be used to differentiate between NO3 \u2212sourced from arid region subsoil NO3 \u2212reservoirs and anthropogenic wastewater. Linhoff and Lunzer (2021) infer that the arroyo \ufb02oodplain subsoil NO3 \u2212 reservoirs may be \ufb02ushed to the aquifer through arroyo channel migration over the \ufb02oodplain. This \ufb02ushing could also occur through large sewer line releases which would act to saturate the subsoil and mobilize subsoil NO3 \u2212 to the aquifer. For example, site KAFB-0514 is located directly under and ad- jacent to a major accidental sewer line releases in 1994, 2003, and 2013 (Copland, 2019) though it has low Cl\u2212/Br\u2212(63) and high NO3 \u2212/Cl\u2212(2) ra- tios along with elevated NO3 \u2212(34.4 mg/L NO3-N) and three CEC detections; these elemental ratios suggest subsoil NO3 \u2212constitutes the bulk of the NO3 \u2212 source while CECs indicate a limited wastewater contribution. If the subsoil NO3 \u2212in the arroyo \ufb02oodplain is a major NO3 \u2212source to the aquifer, this in\ufb02uence should be seen in other major ion ratios.

In the arroyo \ufb02oodplain, Linhoff and Lunzer (2021) found that subsoil porewater mass ratios of NO3 \u2212/Cl\u2212and Cl\u2212/Br\u2212were similar to local precipitation. If ratios of Ca2+, Mg2+, and Na+ in subsoil porewaters are also similar to local pre- cipitation, these cations may help trace the NO3 \u2212source. There is a correla- tion between the ratios of TN/Cl\u2212, TN/Na+, TN/Ca2+, and TN/Mg2+ in groundwater in the arroyo \ufb02oodplain and ratios in the local precipitation (Fig. 6).

Altogether, Figs. 3, 5, and 6 sug- gest that while much of the NO3 \u2212contamination in the region is from both anthropogenic and natural sources, the highest NO3 \u2212groundwater concentrations are of natural origin. Sites that have high NO3 \u2212but neither elevated Cl\u2212/Br\u2212nor NO3 \u2212/Cl\u2212ratios (Fig. 5) cannot be clearly differenti- ated using these elemental ratios and may contain a mixture of both natural and anthropogenic NO3 \u2212sources; N isotopes, CECs, and C isotopes provide clari\ufb01cation for many of these sites as described below. If naturally occurring vadose zone NO3 \u2212is a major source to the aquifer, mass balance of the source must be considered. Assuming a saturated aqui- fer thickness of 30 m and a porosity of 0.2, and complete mixing over this depth, as noted in Linhoff and Lunzer (2021), \ufb02ushing all observed subsoil Fig. 3.

Dashed lines show the mixing pathway of dilute groundwater with a hypothetical septic or sewer wastewater with Cl\u2212and Br\u2212concentrations of 126 Cl\u2212mg/L and 0.21 mg/L respectively (Katz et al., 2011). Labeled sites have elevated Cl\u2212/Br\u2212ratios potentially indicating in\ufb02uence from septic or sewer wastewater sources. B. Linhoff Science of the Total Environment 848 (2022) 157345 9 NO3 \u2212(10,000 to 38,000 kg NO3-N/ha) to the aquifer would result in groundwater NO3 \u2212concentrations between 167 and 633 mg/L NO3-N. However, hydraulic conductivity in the Upper Santa Fe Group aquifer is likely between 0.5 and 12 m/day (Kernodle, 1998), hence \ufb02ushing subsoil NO3 \u2212to the aquifer through the migration of the arroyo channel over the \ufb02oodplain or through land use changes (such as irrigation, septic leach \ufb01elds, leaky infrastructure, etc.) would result in pulses of high NO3 \u2212that would soon be diluted. For example, accidental sewer line releases on KAFB have likely provided a mechanism for \ufb02ushing subsoil NO3 \u2212to the aquifer. After multiple sewer line releases, time series sampling at KAFB- 0514, KAFB-0516, and KAFB-0517 revealed pulses of elevated NO3 \u2212 (60 to 70 mg/L NO3-N) with correspondingly high NO3 \u2212/Cl\u2212ratios (2 to 3). These were followed by high Cl\u2212/Br\u2212ratios (>130) and decreasing NO3 \u2212concentrations (Fig. S5). This observation suggests the sewer line re- leases acted to \ufb02ush subsoil NO3 \u2212to the aquifer as also suggested by the presence of CECs (Table 1). Due to the very large size of the subsoil NO3 \u2212 reservoir mobilized, the groundwater chemistry following the sewer line re- leases was dominated by the natural (high NO3 \u2212/Cl\u2212ratios) rather than the anthropogenic signal (high Cl\u2212/Br\u2212). Once the subsoil reservoir was exhausted, the anthropogenic NO3 \u2212signal was then observed. This is dis- cussed in more detail in S.8.1. 5.2. Nitrate fate Anthropogenic N sources often contain reduced N species such as ON, NH4 +, and NO2 \u2212though these can also be found naturally (Robertson and Cherry, 1992; Zhang et al., 2015). Dissolved ON in groundwater may be from forests and wetlands (Perakis and Hedin, 2002) or anthropogenic sources such as wastewater (Kroeger et al., 2006) and agricultural inputs (Lorite-Herrera et al., 2009). In this study, ON was detected at sites that contained other reduced N species and CEC detections as well as low O2 (<2 mg/L), hence, an anthropogenic source for ON is likely (Tables S2 and S5). In addition, three of four sites with detectable CH4 also contained reduced N species (Tables S2 and S5). Water samples from eight sites contained elevated \u03b415N[NO3] indica- tive of NO3 \u2212largely sourced from human wastewater or manure (\u03b415N [NO3] > 8 \u2030; Figs. 2B, 4, and Table 1). Nitrate concentrations at these sites varied between 0.05 and 15.5 mg/L NO3-N (Fig. 2C). At sites where denitri\ufb01cation had likely occurred in the aquifer (Table S6), NO3 \u2212source appropriation using NO3 \u2212isotopes (Fig. 2) was done using \u03b415N[NO3]\u00b0 in- stead of measured values to avoid assigning a wastewater source to ground- water that has naturally undergone denitri\ufb01cation in the aquifer.

Several surface water sites had relatively high \u03b418O[NO3] values (\u03b418O[NO3] > 9 \u2030; Fig. 2B) and \u03b415N[NO3] values near 5 \u2030. This could indicate mixing with unaltered atmospheric NO3 \u2212deposition in surface waters. The isotopic composition of the subsoil NO3 \u2212is unknown. Evaporite salts in Death Valley, USA have \u03b418O[NO3] values ~45 \u2030, values high enough to argue for an atmospheric N source (B\u00f6hlke et al., 1997). NO3 \u2212ac- cumulated in the subsoils of arroyo \ufb02oodplains is likely derived from N in the arroyo channel stream water through evapoconcentration and the nitri- \ufb01cation of reduced N species. \u03b418O[NO3] of the Tijeras Arroyo water varied between 8.2 \u2030 to 12.3 \u2030 (Table 1). During nitri\ufb01cation, two oxygens are derived from water (\u03b418O[H2O] = \u221225 \u2030 to +4) while one is from the atmosphere (\u03b418O + 23 \u2030; (Kendall, 1998). Hence, nitri\ufb01cation generally produces waters with \u03b418O[NO3] values between \u221210 \u2030 and + 10 \u2030. Further N cycling in the subsoils and oxygen exchange between NO3 \u2212and water will also produce NO3 \u2212isotopic results in the range of normal soil N (Kendall, 1998). Therefore, it is unlikely that NO3 \u2212derived from the subsoil vadose zone can be differentiated through the isotopes of NO3 \u2212in ground- water. As might be expected for a subsoil NO3 \u2212source, sites with highly elevated NO3 \u2212concentrations (16\u2013229 mg/L NO3-N) all had \u03b415N[NO3] and \u03b418O-NO3 values in line with soil ON (Fig. 2B and C). Elevated Cl\u2212/Br\u2212ratios in groundwater often correspond to human and animal wastewater sources (Davis et al., 1998; Panno et al., 2006). If >8 \u2030 \u03b415N[NO3] values are indicative of inputs from septic waste, then in- creasing Cl\u2212/Br\u2212ratios should correspond to an increase in \u03b415N[NO3]. Fig. 2D shows a correlation (r2 = 0.61) between higher Cl\u2212/Br\u2212ratios and \u03b415N[NO3]. If elevated NO3 \u2212/Cl\u2212ratios correspond to vadose zone NO3 \u2212at this \ufb01eld site (Linhoff and Lunzer, 2021), then high NO3 \u2212/Cl\u2212 ratios should correspond to lower \u03b415N[NO3] values in line with soil N. This relationship is shown in Fig. 2E. The lower NO3 \u2212/Cl\u2212ratios with re- spect to higher \u03b415N[NO3] values could also be the result of denitri\ufb01cation. However, recalculating the NO3 \u2212/Cl\u2212ratios with the calculated [NO3]\u00b0 concentrations (Table S6) prior to denitri\ufb01cation results in only a very small shift in the NO3 \u2212/Cl\u2212ratios. For example, using the estimated [NO3]\u00b0 concentration (12.6 mg/L NO3-N) for ST105MW015 instead of the measured NO3 \u2212(9.06 mg/L NO3-N) value results in a NO3 \u2212/Cl\u2212ratio of 0.5 instead of 0.3. 5.3. Contaminants of emerging concern Most CEC (WWI, pharmaceuticals, and arti\ufb01cial sweeteners) have been synthesized in the last century and do not occur naturally in the environ- ment. Ideal CEC compounds for tracing wastewater are those that are pres- ent at suf\ufb01cient concentrations in wastewater, persistent in the subsurface environment, and amenable to rapid and sensitive analysis (McCance et al., 2018). Detection of CEC in groundwater can be used as an indication of anthropogenic pollution sources and of recent recharge (Lee et al., 2019). CECs were found in nearly every part of the \ufb01eld area including the regional and perched aquifers on KAFB, rangeland on Isleta Pueblo south of KAFB, and the neighborhoods sampled east (Carnuel) and west (Mountain View) of KAFB (Table 1 and Fig. 1). Like NO3 \u2212concentrations, groundwater sites with a greater depth to water tended to have fewer CECs (Fig. S5) indicating a surface source for both NO3 \u2212and CEC. All sites with no CEC detections were in wells with water levels >125 m below land surface. Surface waters had by far the highest number of CECs with 5 to 32 detections in the ephemeral stream Tijeras Arroyo. Past work on pharmaceuticals in groundwater has shown most frequent detections are in shallow wells with a young water compo- nent, fractured crystalline bedrock, in domestic wells, and in areas of mixed land use (Bex\ufb01eld et al., 2019). That result was repeated in this study with shallower wells, wells screened in the fractured granite bedrock, and developed areas had the highest number of CEC detections which agreed with the \ufb01ndings of Bex\ufb01eld et al. (2019). Pharmaceuticals were nearly absent throughout the \ufb01eld area possibly because of the depth of the water table and the short half-life of many of these compounds (Bex\ufb01eld et al., 2019). Caffeine and acetaminophen have been proposed as speci\ufb01c molecular markers of wastewater (Tran et al., 2014), however, these chemicals were only measured in surface water samples from the Fig. 5.

These compounds are commonly found in wastewater, groundwater, and surface waters (Margot et al., 2015; Peng et al., 2014). BPA concentrations in wastewater are generally ~1 \u03bcg/L and an order of magnitude lower in wastewater treatment facility ef\ufb02uent and land\ufb01ll leachate (Margot et al., 2015; Peng et al., 2014). In this study, BPA varied from 0.03 to 2.13 \u03bcg/L with the highest concentrations found in the surface water site, Tijeras Arroyo (0.18\u20132.13 \u03bcg/L), and KAFB-0615 (1.83 \u03bcg/L) located in the southeast portion of KAFB. BPA de- tections were con\ufb01ned to KAFB and the Mountain View neighborhood west of KAFB. DEP and DEET are commonly associated with wastewater (Margot et al., 2015). DEP detections in groundwater were centered near recent accidental sewer line releases (KAFB-0514, 0516, 0517) and near the north- east side of KAFB near a residential area (KAFB-0624, ST105MW009). It was also detected in multiple samples from the Tijeras Arroyo surface water site west of KAFB. DEET was detected in the same areas but at fewer sites. TPhP was detected at KAFB-0311, KAFB-0514, KAFB-0615, KAFB- 0904, TA2-W-19, and TJA-7 on KAFB as well as at RIMW-06S west of KAFB. These detections largely center in the regional or perched aquifers around Tijeras Arroyo with the exception of KAFB-0615 and TA2-W-19. TPhP has been used extensively as a \ufb02ame retardant (van der Veen and de Boer, 2012) and has been a known environmental contaminant for de- cades (Muir et al., 1980) occurring regularly in wastewater (Margot et al., 2015). It is often found in groundwater due to its extensive use in house- holds though it degrades fairly rapidly and is not known to bioaccumulate (Funk et al., 2019). Neotame was approved for use in the United States in 2002 (U.S. Food and Drug Administration, 2018) and has since been incorporated into a wide variety of food products and beverages (Aguilar et al., 2008). Because Fig. 6. Major ion mass ratios of sites outside and within the arroyo \ufb02oodplain.

Linhoff Science of the Total Environment 848 (2022) 157345 12 it largely breaks down during metabolism (Margot et al., 2015), only trace amounts enter the environment. Therefore, it can serve as a powerful tracer of very recent or ongoing in\ufb02ux of wastewater ef\ufb02uent. Neotame was the most commonly detected CEC (n = 12) in this study which might be related to the extremely low detection limit for neotame (0.2 ng/L) versus other sweeteners (saccharin: 10 ng/L; acesulfame-K: 5 ng/L; aspartame: 1 ng/L). The occurrence of neotame in this study is in contrast to other studies that have not found neotame in wastewater ef\ufb02uent or groundwater though the detection limits in these other studies were orders of magnitude higher (Li et al., 2020; Margot et al., 2015). Notably, neotame was not found at any site in this study where denitri\ufb01cation was suspected, potentially because reducing conditions in the aquifer could result in the oxidation of neotame. Neotame was related to \u03b415N[NO3] (r2 = 0.64; Fig. S7) which indicates that it may be associated with wastewater. Neotame was also slightly corre- lated to HCO3 \u2212(r2 = 0.55; Fig. S7) and Ca2+ (r2 = 0.52; Fig. S7) at sites where it was detected. This is possibly the result of a septic or sewer source with high \u03b415N[NO3] values whereby denitri\ufb01cation causes an increase in HCO3 \u2212(Eq. (4)). Alternatively, nitri\ufb01cation of reduced N species associated with wastewater produces protons generating acidity (Eqs. (5) and (6)) causing the dissolution of carbonates (Menci\u00f3 et al., 2016). Both reactions are associated with a wastewater NO3 \u2212source. 2NH3 \u00fe 3O2\u21922NO\u2212 2 \u00fe 2H2O \u00fe 2H\u00fe \u00f05\u00de NO\u2212 2 \u00fe O2\u21922NO\u2212 3 \u00f06\u00de Neotame was not correlated to Cl\u2212/Br\u2212or NO3 \u2212/Cl\u2212ratios. Unlike Cl\u2212 and Br\u2212, neotame biodegrades in the environment, and its utility as a tracer is more related to its presence or absence rather than concentration. Where it was detected (Fig. S4), one can assume recent (post-2002) in\ufb01ltration of an unknown proportion of wastewater. 5.4. Separating natural and anthropogenic recharge sources using 3H, CEC, and 14C CECs were detected at six 3H dead sites (Fig. 7; Table 1). 3H does not re- equilibrate (and 14C is very slow to re-equilibrate) with the atmosphere during recirculation of groundwater through infrastructure (Cook and Dogramaci, 2019). Groundwater recharged from leaky infrastructure will likely contain CECs, yet it may have different 14C and 3H values than natu- rally recharged groundwater. At two water-supply wells adjacent to KAFB, Travis et al. (2021) measured 14C values of 37 and 27 PMC and no 3H; they also found 14C values decreased with depth and the deepest wells\u2014 screened ~80 m below the water table\u2014had 14C values between 7.6 and 12 PMC and no 3H. Hence, groundwater recharged through leaky infra- structure in the \ufb01eld area on KAFB likely contains old 14C, no 3H, and CECs. At groundwater sites that are 3H dead with CEC detections and rela- tively low 14C values (<55 PMC), recharge is likely occurring solely through leaky infrastructure and not modern recharge (Fig. 7A).

Using this qualitative assessment, only two sites (of 17 measured for 3H, 14C and CEC) show po- tential evidence of natural modern recharge (KAFB-0903 and Abandoned Chical). KAFB-0903 is in the northeast portion of Tijerras Arroyo (Fig. 1) and may receive in\ufb01ltration through rainfall; the Abandoned Chical well is relatively shallow (~22 m surface to water level; southwest side of the study area on Isleta Pueblo) and contains geochemistry that suggests waste- water contamination (NO3-N = 13.5, Cl/Br = 130, \u03b415N[NO3] = 10.1; Table 1). Sites likely recharged through leaky infrastructure (low 14C values, 3H dead, CEC detections), were generally on KAFB except for IP1 (located on the southern KAFB boundary near former sewage lagoons; Fig. 1). These ar- ti\ufb01cial recharge sites generally had low NO3 \u2212/Cl\u2212(0.03 to 2.2; median 0.35) and variable Cl\u2212/Br\u2212ratios (63 to 172; median 77). Interestingly, KAFB- 0514, which contains low concentrations of 3H (2.13 pCi/L), a high NO3 \u2212/ Cl ratio (2.2), and CECs may contain naturally occurring vadose zone NO3 \u2212 mobilized during accidental sewer line releases (Section 5.1 and S.8.1). Hence at this site, a mix of recharge sources is likely. Arti\ufb01cial recharge appears to affect all regions sampled. This includes sites where water levels were >150 m deep and had low 14C values (<20 PMC). In this semi-arid environment, natural aquifer recharge likely only occurs at the mountain front boundary (Plummer et al., 2012) and through arroyos (Linhoff and Lunzer, 2021). Finding a near ubiquitous presence of CECs in groundwater beneath a thick vadose zone suggests leaky infrastruc- ture is a major source of recharge to the aquifer. 6. Summary and conclusions Determining the source of NO3 \u2212to groundwater is often dif\ufb01cult. This is especially true where there are multiple anthropogenic and natural NO3 \u2212 sources known to contribute NO3 \u2212to groundwater. In this work, simple major ion ratios (Cl\u2212/Br\u2212and NO3 \u2212/Cl\u2212) proved a very useful \ufb01rst approx- imation for deciphering between anthropogenic and arid region vadose zone NO3 \u2212in groundwater. The highest NO3 \u2212concentrations corresponded to high NO3 \u2212/Cl\u2212(>1.5) and low Cl\u2212/Br\u2212ratios (<100), implying a sub- soil NO3 \u2212source from the arroyo \ufb02oodplains; this was further supported by NO3 \u2212isotope analysis (\u03b415N[NO3] < 8 \u2030). In contrast, sites with elevated Cl\u2212/Br\u2212(>120) ratios generally had high \u03b415N[NO3] values (>8 \u2030) and abundant CEC detections implying a wastewater NO3 \u2212source. Natural attenuation of NO3 \u2212depends on the extent of denitri\ufb01cation happening in an aquifer (Nikolenko et al., 2018). In this study, where deni- tri\ufb01cation was occurring, reaction progress varied from 2 to 31 % Fig. 7. The relationship between contaminants of emerging concern (CEC), 14C, and 3H. In this arid region, arti\ufb01cial recharge from leaky infrastructure is likely at sites with CEC detections, low 14C, and no 3H. Note, both panels show results from the same set of samples. B. Linhoff Science of the Total Environment 848 (2022) 157345 13 (Section 4.2 and Table S6). The dual isotope approach\u2014analyzing both \u03b415N[NO3] and \u03b418O[NO3]\u2014showed that at least eight sites contained NO3 \u2212largely sourced from a wastewater or manure source (Fig. 2, Table 1). Most of these sites also contained reduced N species, elevated Cl\u2212/Br\u2212ratios, and CECs further suggesting a wastewater source. Where denitri\ufb01cation has occurred in the study area, \u03b413C and major ion analyses suggest denitri\ufb01cation has oxidized organic carbon to produce HCO3 \u2212. With few exceptions, the general lack of denitri\ufb01cation across the \ufb01eld area demonstrates that NO3 \u2212likely behaves conservatively through most of the \ufb01eld area; hence, changes in ratios of NO3 \u2212to conservative ions such as Cl\u2212cannot be explained by denitri\ufb01cation and can be used to help differentiate NO3 \u2212sources. Further, due to the lack of denitri\ufb01ca- tion, this work demonstrates that most of the elevated NO3 \u2212measured in the \ufb01eld area can be expected to persist. Readers interested in more detailed discussion of NO3 \u2212sources at individual sites are referred to S.8 and Table S3. As the arroyo stream channel migrates across the \ufb02oodplain over de- cades of monsoon seasons, subsoil NO3 \u2212reservoirs may periodically be \ufb02ushed from subsoils and raise groundwater NO3 \u2212concentrations. It's also likely that in arroyo \ufb02oodplains, irrigation, accidental sewer line releases, and leaky infrastructure will \ufb02ush naturally occurring vadose zone NO3 \u2212 to underlying aquifers exacerbating NO3 \u2212contamination. In many arid re- gions with thick unsaturated zones, groundwater recharge only naturally occurs through arroyos. The possibility that this recharge source could also periodically contain highly concentrated NO3 \u2212is concerning. While large subsoil NO3 \u2212reservoirs have not been observed outside of the \ufb02ood- plain of Tijeras Arroyo in this \ufb01eld area, similar reservoirs might also be present in many arroyo \ufb02oodplains across the southwestern United States or in other arid settings. More research is needed to determine exactly where and how these NO3 \u2212reservoirs form and the extent of groundwater quality affected by this newly discovered NO3 \u2212source. In this study, CECs were nearly ubiquitous across groundwater and sur- face waters and thus excellent indicators of recent recharge. Neotame emerged as a surprising tracer of very recent or ongoing in\ufb01ltration of wastewater. It breaks down rapidly in the environment and was only ap- proved for use in the United States in 2002 (U.S. Food and Drug Administration, 2018), hence it serves to help constrain the timing of recharge. However, because land\ufb01lls, accidental sewer line releases, and septic systems all contribute CECs, it is dif\ufb01cult to decipher different an-"

However, because land\ufb01lls, accidental sewer line releases, and septic systems all contribute CECs, it is dif\ufb01cult to decipher different an- thropogenic NO3 \u2212sources based on CECs alone. Future studies could exam- ine the CEC composition in transects moving downgradient of sewer line releases, septic leach \ufb01elds, and land\ufb01lls to determine whether the compo- sition of CECs could be used in deciphering between types of anthropogenic wastewater sources. In this study, some sites with a very likely subsoil NO3 \u2212 source (based on elemental ratios and \u03b415N[NO3]) CECs were still detected. In these cases, either surface wastewater releases may have mobilized sub- soil NO3 \u2212to the aquifer or the elevated NO3 \u2212concentrations are naturally occurring and CECs are in\ufb01ltrating to the aquifer through runoff in the ar- royo channel. By combining CECs, 3H, and 14C, this study developed a potentially novel method of differentiating between natural and anthropogenic re- charge. This method is only possible where supply wells pump pre- modern groundwater (3H dead with low PMC), recharge does not naturally occur through the vadose zone following precipitation, and where CECs can be detected. In many arid settings\u2014including most of the area in the pres- ent study\u2014these quali\ufb01cations are met. While the \ufb01nding that leaky infra- structure plays a major role in recharge is not new (e.g., Lerner, 2002), this study shows it is substantial even beneath thick (>150 m) vadose zones in arid regions with limited natural recharge.
