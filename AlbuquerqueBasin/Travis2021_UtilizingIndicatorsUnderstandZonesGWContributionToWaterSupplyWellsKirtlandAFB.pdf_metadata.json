Results for measurements of stable isotopes of an element (with symbol E) in water, solids, and dissolved constituents commonly are expressed as the relative difference in the ratio of the number of the less abundant isotope (iE) to the number of the more abundant isotope of a sample with respect to a measurement standard. viii Abbreviations \u03b42H stable isotope of hydrogen \u03b413C isotopes of carbon \u03b418O stable isotope of oxygen BFF Bulk Fuels Facility bls below land surface CE closed system equilibrium model CFC-11 trichlorofluoromethane CFC-12 dichlorodifluoromethane CFC-113 trichlorotrifluoroethane CFCs chlorofluorocarbons Chi2 error-weighted misfit EDB ethylene dibromide EPA U.S. Environmental Protection Agency KAFB Kirtland Air Force Base MCL maximum contaminant level NOSAMS National Ocean Sciences Accelerator Mass Spectrometry pM percent modern pmC percent modern carbon pmol/kg picomoles per kilogram Ta temperature lapse rate VA Veteran\u2019s Administration USACE U.S. Army Corps of Engineers USGS U.S. Geological Survey \u2030 per mil Utilizing Multiple Hydrogeologic and Anthropogenic Indicators to Understand Zones of Groundwater Contribution to Water-Supply Wells Near Kirtland Air Force Base Bulk Fuels Facility in Southeast Albuquerque, New Mexico By Rebecca E. Travis, Meghan T. Bell, Benjamin S. Linhoff, and Kimberly R. Beisner Abstract In 1999, a jet-fuels release was discovered at the Bulk Fuels Facility on Kirtland Air Force Base, Albuquerque, New Mexico. Contaminants had reached the water table and migrated north-northeast toward water-supply wells. Monitoring wells were installed downgradient from the facil\u00ad ity to determine the primary zones of groundwater production for water-supply wells and assess contaminant presence. The monitoring wells are screened within the Santa Fe Group aquifer system, which includes clay units, at depths as great as 445 meters below land surface, and were categorized as water table, shallow, middle, deep, and aquifer-test pumping wells. Water-supply wells are screened across multiple water-bearing units within the aquifer system. All wells were sampled for major ions, trace elements, nutrients, stable isotopes, dissolved gases, tritium, carbon isotopes, and chlorofluorocarbons. The deeper and water-supply wells have evidence of longer groundwater residence times, as much as thousands of years, and water from the shallower wells shows evidence of anthro\u00ad pogenic nutrient inputs. Aquifer recharge is derived from either the mountain front or seepage from the Rio Grande. Dissolved-gas data indicate that the middle, deep, and aquifer- test pumping, and water-supply wells have cooler recharge temperatures than the shallower wells. Inferred groundwater age varies by method but indicates that the deeper, aquifer- test pumping, and water-supply wells have older water, as much as 15,000 years before present. Results indicate that the water-supply wells draw primarily from the middle and deeper portions of the aquifer system below the clay units and have not been affected by the contaminant plume, although some data indicate a potential for modern water entering some of the deeper and water-supply wells. Introduction In 1999, a jet-fuels release was discovered at the Bulk Fuels Facility (BFF) on Kirtland Air Force Base (KAFB), Albuquerque, New Mexico (fig. 1). Further investigation revealed that jet-fuels related contaminants, in particular ethylene dibromide (EDB), had reached the water table and were migrating north-northeast in the general direction of water-supply wells (U.S. Air Force, 2011). By 2017, the EDB plume extended approximately 1,800 meters (m) (U.S. Army Corps of Engineers [USACE], 2018) northeast of the BFF, and at its deepest, the plume extended 26 m below the water table in 2015 (USACE, 2017). Between 2013 and 2016, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), in collaboration with the Albuquerque Bernalillo County Water Utility Authority and the Air Force Civil Engineer Center, installed four nests of monitoring wells containing 3 to 7 wells each, screened from 130 to 445 m below land surface (bls) (fig. 2) and hereafter referred to as \u201csentinel wells.\u201d Following construction and development, these well nests were sampled and analyzed for a suite of analytes, including major ions, trace elements, and stable isotopes. At least 6 months after construction and develop\u00ad ment, carbon isotopes, chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), dissolved gases, and tritium were sampled at the well nests. The objec\u00ad tive of the sampling was to determine the primary aquifer zone contributing water to water-supply wells and sentinel wells. The major contributing aquifer zone can then be compared to the groundwater affected by jet-fuels related contaminants. A two-pronged strategy that used flow logging and water-quality sampling was utilized to achieve study objectives. The flow- logging study (Travis and Myers, 2019) indicated that most of the water contributing to the wells originated below confining units within the aquifer system. 2 Utilizing Indicators to Understand Groundwater Contribution to Wells Near Kirtland AFB, Albuquerque, N. Mex. Purpose and Scope The primary purpose of this report is to identify the primary zone of contribution of groundwater to water-supply wells in the study area using geochemical lines of evidence. Data used in the analysis include water-quality data collected from the aquifer-test pumping and sentinel wells between 2013 and 2017; water-quality data collected from water-supply wells RC-3, RC-4, and RC-5 as part of a previous study (Plummer and others, 2012) in 1996 and 1997; and water qual\u00ad ity data collected from RC-3 and RC-5 in 2013 as part of this study (table 1). Study Area The study area is located in the Middle Rio Grande Basin in central New Mexico (fig. 1). The basin encompasses approximately 7,925 square kilometers along the Rio Grande Valley, through which the Rio Grande flows from north to south (Thorn and others, 1993). The basin is bounded on the north, east, and south by mountains and on the west by a plateau. Regional groundwater flow is generally southward, although in the study area, local groundwater flow is north\u00ad eastward (Powell and McKean, 2014). This localized flow direction is interpreted to be the result of historical groundwa\u00ad ter pumping in the region. Recent changes in water resource management have resulted in a decrease in groundwater withdrawals and an associated rapid decrease in groundwater gradient in the study area (Galanter and Curry, 2019). Geology and Hydrogeology The Middle Rio Grande Basin is one of a series of allu\u00ad vial basins located in the Rio Grande Rift Valley and contains approximately 4,300 m of alluvial fill in the deepest parts of the basin (Thorn and others, 1993). These sediments are primarily alluvium and colluvium, and the primary aquifer system of the basin is composed of the Oligocene-Pleistocene aged Santa Fe Group and more recent deposits. The forma\u00ad tion of interest in this study is the Sierra Ladrones Formation of the Santa Fe Group, deposited during the Pliocene and early Pleistocene, which has been divided into two members, the axial-fluvial member (QTsa) and the piedmont member (QTsp) (Connell, 2006). QTsa is the lower member of the Sierra Ladrones Formation and is typically associated with axial-fluvial deposits of the ancestral Rio"

These sediments are primarily alluvium and colluvium, and the primary aquifer system of the basin is composed of the Oligocene-Pleistocene aged Santa Fe Group and more recent deposits. The forma\u00ad tion of interest in this study is the Sierra Ladrones Formation of the Santa Fe Group, deposited during the Pliocene and early Pleistocene, which has been divided into two members, the axial-fluvial member (QTsa) and the piedmont member (QTsp) (Connell, 2006). QTsa is the lower member of the Sierra Ladrones Formation and is typically associated with axial-fluvial deposits of the ancestral Rio Grande, generally considered to be the most productive water-bearing deposits in the basin. QTsa is a pebbly to cobbly gray to yellowish-brown sand with interbedded mud. Clasts are rounded and are typically volcanic lithic fragments and quartz arenite (Connell, 2006). Locally, the member is interbedded with two distinct layers, identified by Connell and others (1998) as sand and silt-clay sequences, but observed to be primarily clay and silt-clay in the study area (Bell and others, 2018). QTsp is the upper member of the Sierra Ladrones Formation and is a piedmont facies that progrades onto the lower member from the eastern uplands; the depositional environment is generally interpreted as alluvial fan. The QTsp is composed of poorly consolidated red to yellowish-brown conglomerate and sandstone with minor mudstone. Clasts in the conglomerate are typically limestone, sandstone, and granite (Connell, 2006), containing quartz, mica, plagioclase, and potassium feldspars (Plummer and others, 2012). These two layers are present throughout the study area and generally act as confining units, separating the member into three water-bearing units\u2014an unconfined aquifer and two confined or semiconfined aquifers (Myers and Friesz, 2019). The clay and silt-clay units will be referred to in this paper as \u201cA1\u201d and \u201cA2,\u201d and the top of each unit is located at approximately 356 and 249 m bls, respectively (fig. 2; Myers and Friesz, 2019). Note that the tops of A1 and A2 vary by approximately 10 m in the study area. The subdivision of QTsa below A1 is considered deep, the subdivision between the A1 and A2 units is considered intermediate, or middle, and the QTsa that is located above the A2 unit is considered shal\u00ad low. Throughout this report, wells that are screened in one of these intervals are classified by location relative to the A1 and A2 units. Previous Investigations Groundwater quality in the Middle Rio Grande Basin has been the focus of several investigations, and the area sur\u00ad rounding the BFF and KAFB has been investigated exten\u00ad sively prior and subsequent to the discovery of the jet-fuels release in 1999. Bexfield and others (1999) summarized data that had been collected by the City of Albuquerque from 1988 through 1997 from its water-supply wells across the Middle Rio Grande Basin. Bexfield and Anderholm (2002) discussed spatial and temporal variations in those data for the aquifer system and determined that evapotranspiration, land-use prac\u00ad tices, water sources, and groundwater flow paths likely explain geochemical variations observed between varying aquifer depths in the basin. Plummer and others (2004 and 2012) used extensive chemical and isotopic data, collected in the mid to late 1990s, to refine the conceptual model of groundwater flow in the Middle Rio Grande Basin. These studies identified distribu\u00ad tions of chemical and isotopic constituents and tied them to potential sources of recharge. Based on those distributions, several different hydrochemical zones were identified across the basin. This study provided a robust source of background data for the study area. Bexfield and others (2012) analyzed groundwater flow and chemistry data from 22 monitoring wells and 3 water- supply wells to better understand transport processes in the Albuquerque area. The water-supply wells studied had screened intervals that ranged from approximately 97 to 365 m bls. Results of the analysis indicate that although the Introduction 3 106\u00b030' 107\u00b015' 35\u00b015' 34\u00b030' NEW MEXICO Map area UNITED STATES MEXICO CANADA Base from New Mexico Geospatial Data Acquisition Coordination Committee, 2006, 1:24,000 New Mexico State Plane, Central Zone North American Datum of 1983 Rio Grande Sandia Mountains Rio Grande Valley VA Trumbull Southern Kirtland Air Force Base Cesar Chavez RC-4 RC-3 RC-5 0 1 KILOMETER 0.5 0 1 MILE 0.5 EXPLANATION ( Water-supply well and name #* USGS sentinel well nest and name U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Middle Rio Grande Basin Kirtland Air Force Base boundary Bulk fuels facility 2017 EDB plume (USACE, 2018) 2020 EDB plume (USACE, 2020) 0 15 KILOMETERS 3 6 9 12 0 3 6 9 12 15 MILES ALBUQUERQUE RC-3 VA USACE Figure 1.

Mex. water-supply wells were dominated by older water, a small fraction of younger, potentially human-influenced water was reaching depths similar to the screened intervals of water-supply wells in the Middle Rio Grande Basin. The results of a borehole flow-logging study (Travis and Myers, 2019), coinciding with data collection for this study, indicated that the aquifer-test pumping wells, con\u00ad structed similarly to water-supply wells, are producing most of their water, under both nonpumping and pump\u00ad ing (at approximately 380 liters per minute) conditions, beneath a confining unit, denoted A2 and the top of which is located between 239 and 250 m bls in the study area (fig. 2). In 2015, evidence of the EDB plume was limited to the aquifer above the confining unit (USACE, 2017). Construction details of the USGS sentinel wells are found in Bell and others (2018). Materials and Methods This section of the report describes the sampling design and collection of samples. Laboratory methods used to analyze the samples also are described. Lastly, quality assurance and quality control for the samples are described. Sampling Design Data for this study were collected from multiple types of wells, classified in this report as water-supply wells, aquifer-test pumping wells, and sentinel wells (table 1). These wells are categorized by depth of the screened interval for the purpose of data analysis (table 1, fig. 2). The wells with screens that cross the A1 and A2 units and, therefore, produce water from the upper, middle, and lower QTsa, are the three water-supply wells (RC-3, RC-4, and RC-5) and the two aquifer-test pumping wells (Cesar Chavez aquifer-test pumping well and Southern aquifer-test pumping well). Three wells are screened at the water table in the shallow QTsa unit (Trumbull sentinel well A, Cesar Chavez sentinel well A, and Southern sentinel well A). Three wells screened below the water table, in the upper QTsa unit but above the A2 unit (Cesar Chavez sentinel well B, Southern sen\u00ad tinel well B, and Veteran's Administration [VA] sentinel well A), are categorized as shallow. Four wells screened between the A2 and A1 units, in the middle QTsa unit (Trumbull sentinel well B, Cesar Chavez sentinel well C, Southern sentinel well C, and VA sentinel well B), are categorized as being middle wells. Four wells (Trumbull sentinel well C, Cesar Chavez sentinel well D, Southern sentinel well D, and VA sentinel well C) are categorized as deep wells, as they are screened below the A1 unit in the lower QTsa unit.

Materials and Methods 7 Cesar Chavez and Southern were initially screened to mimic nearby water-supply wells but were grouted to 290 and 262 m bls, respectively, in February 2016. Samples were collected at the aquifer-test pumping wells both before and after grouting was performed. Samples were collected for a variety of analytes to fully characterize the groundwater produced from each screened interval. Major ions, trace elements, and nutrients were sampled from each well to provide information on the general chemical composition, as well as to identify the position of each well along a flow path. Stable isotopes and dissolved gases were sampled to provide information on recharge source and temperature. Carbon isotopes, tritium, and CFCs were sampled to provide data that could be used to estimate the age of water within the different intervals. This analysis incorporates data from 109 water-quality samples. The sentinel wells (14 wells, 98 quarterly samples total) and aquifer-test pumping wells (2 wells, 4 annual samples total) were sampled between 2013 and 2017 (table 1). The water-supply wells were sampled by the USGS in 1996 and 1997 (2 wells, 3 samples; Plummer and others, 2012), and in 2013 for this study (2 wells, 3 samples). Sample Collection Water-quality samples were collected for this study during 2013\u201317 in accordance with procedures described in the USGS National Field Manual (USGS, variously dated). A submersible pump was used to purge three well casing vol\u00ad umes and to sample each sentinel well. The Trumbull, Cesar Chavez, and Southern sentinel wells (A, B, C, and D wells) had dedicated pumps. The VA sentinel wells were sampled with a portable pump until February 2017 and were then sampled with dedicated pumps in February 2017. The USGS Research Drilling Program installed high-capacity submers\u00ad ible pumps in the aquifer-test pumping wells because of the large amount of water pumped from those wells. Cleaning and decontamination procedures were in accordance with USGS National Field Manual guidance (USGS, variously dated) for the portable pump, excluding the dedicated and high- capacity submersible pumps. Dedicated pumps were cleaned in accordance with USGS National Field Manual guidance (USGS, variously dated) before placement, but they were not cleaned prior to the second sampling event, as they were in place within the well. The high-capacity pump exterior was cleaned with a nonphosphate laboratory soap and rinsed with water, and the interior of the pump was flushed with thou\u00ad sands of gallons of groundwater during an aquifer test prior to sampling. Field properties were measured during well purging, including dissolved oxygen, turbidity, specific conduc\u00ad tance, pH, and water temperature (USGS, variously dated). Water samples were filtered (0.45 micron) for major cations, trace elements, alkalinity, and carbon-14 (14C). The major cations and trace elements samples were preserved to pH less than (<) 2 by adding ultrapure nitric acid. Unfiltered samples were collected for stable isotopes, tritium, CFCs, and dissolved and noble gases. Alkalinity was titrated in the field by using the incremental equivalence method (USGS, vari\u00ad ously dated). Water-quality data are available from the USGS National Water Information System database (USGS, 2018), with the exception of the 1996 and 1997 data from RC-3 and RC-4, which can be found in Plummer and others (2012). The data can be retrieved from the database by using the USGS site identification numbers in table 1. Laboratory Methods Water samples were analyzed for major ions, trace ele\u00ad ments, and nutrients by the USGS National Water Quality Laboratory in Denver, Colorado. Inductively coupled plasma- mass spectrometry was used for the following elements: aluminum, antimony, arsenic, barium, beryllium, boron, cadmium, chromium, cobalt, copper, lead, lithium, manganese, molybdenum, nickel, selenium, silver, strontium, thallium, uranium, vanadium, and zinc (Garbarino, 1999; Garbarino and others, 2006). Ion-exchange chromatography was used to analyze for chloride, fluoride and sulfate (Fishman, 1993), and calcium, iron, magnesium, manganese, sodium, potassium, and silicon dioxide were analyzed by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrophotometry (Fishman and Friedman, 1989). Nitrate plus nitrite (hereafter referred to as \u201cnitrate\u201d) was ana\u00ad lyzed by colorimetry (Patton and Kryskalla, 2011). Major ions and nutrients are reported in milligrams per liter, and trace elements are in micrograms per liter. The dissolved gases argon (Ar), carbon dioxide, methane, nitrogen (N2), and oxygen were analyzed by the USGS Reston Groundwater Dating Laboratory in Reston, Virginia, by using a gas chromatograph (USGS, 2019). The ratio of N2 to Ar is hereafter referred to as \u201cN2/Ar.\u201d Dissolved gases are reported in milligrams per liter. Dissolved noble gases (argon, helium [He], krypton [Kr], neon, and xenon [Xe]) were analyzed by the USGS Noble Gas Laboratory in Denver, Colo. (Hunt, 2015). Noble gases are reported in cubic centimeters at stan\u00ad dard temperature and pressure per gram of water. Stable isotope ratios (\u03b418O and \u03b42H) were analyzed at the USGS Reston Stable Isotope Laboratory. The isotopes are ana\u00ad lyzed by dual-inlet isotope-ratio mass spectrometry (R\u00e9v\u00e9sz and Coplen, 2008a, b). Stable isotope ratios are reported in per mil relative to Vienna Standard Mean Ocean Water. Tritium was analyzed at the University of Miami in Miami, Florida, by using low-level gas proportional coun\u00ad ters (Thatcher and others, 1977), with the exception of the sample from TR-1A, which was analyzed by Lamont Doherty Earth Observatory at Columbia University in Palisades, New York.

Mex. 14C concentrations and ratios of the stable isotopes of carbon-13 to carbon-12 (\u03b413C), reported relative to the Vienna Pee Dee Belemnite standard of dissolved inorganic carbon, were analyzed by the National Ocean Sciences Accelerator Mass Spectrometry (NOSAMS) at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Woods Hole, Massachusetts. 14C values reported by the NOSAMS as percent modern (pM) were denormalized by using equation 5 of Plummer and others (2012) to percent modern carbon (pmC). CFCs were analyzed by the USGS Reston Groundwater Dating Laboratory in Reston, Va. Concentrations of trichloro\u00ad fluoromethane (CFC-11), dichlorodifluoromethane (CFC-12), and trichlorotrifluoroethane (CFC-113) are detected by using purge and trap gas chromatography with electron-capture detection (Busenberg and Plummer, 1992). CFC samples were collected in triplicate, and CFC results are reported in pico\u00ad moles per kilogram. Quality Assurance/Quality Control Quality-assurance samples included 32 blanks (field, equipment, source sol ution) and 6 replicate pairs. Field blanks (12 trace element blanks and 7 major ion blanks) were collected between 2016 and 2017. Twelve equipment blanks (trace element blanks and major ion blanks) were collected between 2015 and 2017. Source solution blanks (eight trace element blanks and six major ion blanks) were collected between 2015 and 2017. Results from quality-assurance samples are presented in the \u201cQuality Assessment\u201d section. When possible, field and equipment blanks were col\u00ad lected by using the entire length of tubing installed in the well, as well as the pump head. However, dedicated pumps were installed in the sentinel wells, so it was not possible to col\u00ad lect field blanks on the in-well tubing and pump heads at the Trumbull, Southern, and Cesar Chavez well nests for most of the study duration. These field blanks were collected by using only the aboveground sample line and a centrifugal pump and not the in-well tubing and pump heads in place within the wells. The Trumbull well pumps were removed prior to the June 2017 sampling event, and at this point, the entire in-well tubing and pump heads were used for field blank collection at the Trumbull wells. There were no permanently installed pumps at the VA well nest, so field and equipment blanks were conducted by using a portable pump, including in-well tubing and pump head. Sampling Results This section of the report first describes the quality assessment using quality assurance samples collected for this study. Then, sampling results for general chemistry, isotopic data, dissolved gases, carbon isotopes, tritium, and CFCs are described. Quality Assessment The number of field blanks with major ion or trace element detections above the detection limit is reported by analyte in table 2. If an analyte discussed in this report is not included in table 2, it was not detected in blank samples. A concentration representing the potential threshold of influence on concentrations in environmental samples was established at 10 times the greatest blank concentration. All environmental sample concentrations were greater than the threshold of influ\u00ad ence for all analytes except boron in equipment blanks, fluo\u00ad ride in equipment blanks, and manganese in equipment and field blanks. The only threshold that would apply to the report dataset would be for manganese, because it was found in the field blanks within a concentration range similar to that of the environmental samples, and an assumption is made that the field blanks are more representative of potential contamina\u00ad tion bias than equipment blanks. However, a detailed analysis of manganese concentrations was not conducted in this study, and no threshold was applied. Replicates were analyzed by evaluating the relative percent difference of six replicate pairs based on methods in Mueller and others (2015; eq. 1, table 3). \u200b Relative Percent Difference = \u200b 100 \u00d7 \u200b \u200b(larger result \u2212 smaller result)\u200b ___________________________ \u200b(larger result + smaller result)\u200b / 2\u200b\u200b\b (1) For environmental sampling events with few replicates, Mueller and others (2015) suggest a criterion of 20-percent relative percent difference for replicate pairs to be considered acceptable. General Chemistry and Isotopic Data Samples collected from near the water table; from the shal\u00ad low, middle, and deep aquifer; and across multiple intervals have several geochemical distinctions. On the Piper plot (fig. 3) (Piper, 1944), the distribution of the major ions is somewhat distinct between samples from the shallow and water table wells com\u00ad pared to those from the middle, deep, aquifer-pumping test, and water-supply wells. Samples from the water table, middle, deep, aquifer-test pumping, and water-supply wells are calcium-type water, and those from the shallow wells at VA and Southern (VA-1A and SO-1B) are sodium or potassium type. The shallow well samples from VA and Southern are also distinct, with a higher bicarbon\u00ad ate water type than samples from the water table, middle, deep, aquifer-test pumping, and water-supply wells, which have no dominant water type or a lower bicarbonate water type. To delve into these distinctions more, the cation and anion distributions were reviewed. The water table, middle, deep, aquifer-test pumping, and water-supply well samples had similar cation distributions, con\u00ad taining less than 20 percent magnesium, 30\u201370 percent calcium, Sampling Results 9 and 20\u201365 percent sodium and potassium. The cation distribu\u00ad tion in samples from the shallow wells at VA and Southern (VA-1A and SO-1B) was distinct from that of the other wells, containing higher percentages of sodium and potassium (45\u201365 percent) and lower percentages of calcium (30\u201350 per\u00ad cent), whereas most samples from other wells contain lower percentages of"

Anions in samples from the middle, deep, aquifer- test pumping, and water-supply wells ranged from 20 to 50 percent chloride and fluoride, 40 to 70 percent bicarbonate and carbonate, and 15 to 20 percent sulfate. Compared to samples from the deeper wells, those from the water table wells had higher percentages of sulfate, 20\u201330 percent, and a generally lower range of percentages for bicarbonate and carbonate, ranging from 30 to 60 percent. The shallow well samples at VA and Southern (VA-1A and SO-1B) are again distinct, with higher percentages of bicarbonate and carbonate (70\u201380 percent), lower percentages of chloride and fluoride (<20 percent), and slightly lower percentages of sulfate (10\u201315 per\u00ad cent), whereas the shallow well samples at Cesar Chavez had higher percentages of sulfate and an anion composition similar to that of the water table well samples. Bexfield and others (2012) and Plummer and others (2012) showed that there were some variations in the chem\u00ad istry of groundwater with depth in the Santa Fe Group, but, for this study, sample representation was limited by the small number of nested monitoring wells.

Mex. showed little variation because of the water\u2019s contact with primarily the same material throughout the different screened intervals. Plummer and others (2012) found that there was more areal variation than vertical variation; however, the most consistent differences observed vertically and vary\u00ad ing with depth were increases in sodium, arsenic, and boron and decreases in calcium. Bexfield and others (2012) found that fluoride, silica, and potassium increased with depth because of the mineral weathering of the origin material in the Santa Fe Group. Some of these distinctions were noted in the sentinel, aquifer-test pumping, and water-supply wells (fig. 4). The field properties also showed some distinction with depth (fig. 4). Water from all wells generally had a pH of greater than 7 standard units. Specific conductance ranged from approximately 300 to 700 microsiemens per centimeter at 25 degrees Celsius (\u00b5S/cm at 25 \u00b0C) in the water table and shallow wells, 300 to 550 \u00b5S/cm in the middle wells, and approximately 450 to 550 \u00b5S/cm in the deep wells; aquifer- test pumping and water-supply wells were within the range for middle wells. Dissolved oxygen concentration ranged from 0 to 13 milligrams per liter (mg/L) in the water table and shal\u00ad low wells and did not exceed 4 mg/L in the middle and deep wells (fig. 4). Arsenic, potassium, and silica concentrations all increased with depth in the sentinel wells and aquifer-test pumping wells. Arsenic concentrations exceeded the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) maximum contami\u00ad nant level (MCL) of 10 micrograms per liter (EPA, 2019) in all of the deep and aquifer-test pumping wells. The increases in arsenic, potassium, and silica concentrations with depth may indicate longer residence times within the source mate\u00ad rial (Bexfield and others, 2012). Fluoride concentration did not increase with depth. Sodium concentration did not appear to increase with depth, and the highest concentrations were in the shallow and water table wells. Calcium had a broad concentration range in the shallow and water table wells, as well as the highest concentrations (fig. 4). The middle, deep, and aquifer-test pumping wells had smaller ranges of values in the mid-range concentrations. Concentrations of other elements also varied among the screened intervals (fig. 4). Nitrate concentrations were greater in the shallow and water table wells than in the other wells, but none of the concentra\u00ad tions exceeded the EPA MCL level of 10 mg/L (EPA, 2019). Uranium concentrations were highest in the deep wells, specifically CC-1D and CC-1E. Stable isotopes were sampled from all wells. The deep well samples had \u03b42H values ranging from \u221297.4 to \u221294.2 per mil (\u2030) and \u03b418O values ranging from \u221213.20 to \u221212.90\u2030, whereas samples from the middle aquifers ranged from \u221296.6 to \u221291.4\u2030 \u03b42H and from \u221213.20 to \u221212.50\u2030 \u03b418O (fig. 5).

Mex. samples from the aquifer-test pumping wells and water-supply wells had a wide range of \u03b42H and \u03b418O values (\u221297.3 to \u221285.9\u2030 \u03b42H and \u221213.20 to \u221211.70\u2030 \u03b418O) and did not display a bimodal distribution. Analytical results of post-grouting samples from the aquifer-test pumping wells indicate that the water was heavier (fig. 5) than water from the initial sam\u00ad pling event. Plummer and others (2012) concluded that ranges from \u221280 to \u221285\u2030 \u03b42H in the study area indicated mountain-front recharge, which was seen in samples from springs and arroyos in the Sandia Mountains, and that more depleted values of \u221290 to \u2212100\u2030 \u03b42H indicated recharge originating as seepage from the Rio Grande, which is sourced by snowmelt from Colorado and northern New Mexico. Samples collected in the 1980s and late 1990s analyzed by the same laboratory using the same method indicate that groundwater in water-supply well RC-3 has a stable isotopic composition of \u221285.9\u2030 \u03b42H (Plummer and others, 2012). However, samples collected from RC-3 in 2013 showed a more depleted value of \u221290.1\u2030 and may indicate a change in the source of water to this well (fig. 5). RC-3 is the easternmost well in this study and is near a steep isotopic isopleth boundary presented in Plummer and others (2012) (fig. 6).

Mex. model (CE) (Aeschbach-Hertig and others, 2000) and a standard inverse technique (Newton method) to minimize the error-weighted misfit (Chi2) between measured and modeled values (Aeschbach-Hertig and others, 1999; Ballentine and Hall, 1999; Manning and Solomon, 2003). A local relation between recharge temperature and elevation can place useful constraints on recharge elevation (Zuber and others, 1995; Aeschbach-Hertig and others, 1999; Manning and Solomon, 2003). A temperature lapse rate (Ta) was calculated for the Albuquerque area based on the modern mean annual air tem\u00ad perature of 13.6 \u00b0C (Plummer and others, 2012) and the mean lapse rate of \u22125.5 \u00b0C per kilometer (Meyer, 1992) (fig. 7). Discharge from springs at 2,012 and 1,951-m elevations in the Sandia Mountains had recharge temperatures of 8\u20139 \u00b0C (Plummer and others, 2012). Water table temperatures for typical depths below land surface are generally 0\u20133 \u00b0C above Ta, noted as Ta+1.5 and Ta+3 (Domenico and Schwartz, 1990; Lee and Hahn, 2006; Cey, 2009). Three samples\u2014CC-1C (environmental and replicate) and TR-1B\u2014have laboratory comments indicating issues that excluded the samples from analysis. Three replicate samples (CC-1A, CC-1B, SO-1A) were analyzed, but only one replicate had a good model fit (CC-1A). Both CC-1A samples (environmental and replicate) have similar calculated recharge temperatures of 5.8 and 4.5 \u00b0C. However, these recharge temperatures are unreasonable (too low), resulting from fractionated excess air that is not in equilibrium with atmospheric gases. The fractionated excess air may indicate that there were remnant gases from the well drilling process, which can persist for years after drilling depending on aquifer properties (Busenberg and Plummer, 2010). Samples from SO-1A and TR-1A were not included in recharge tempera\u00ad ture calculations because the model fits for the data were higher than the Ta equation (fig. 7). Although the reason for these elevated recharge temperatures was not determined and remains unknown in this study, Plummer and others (2012) suggested that recharge through a thick unsaturated zone could be warmed along a geothermal gradient prior to reaching the water table, which could elevate recharge temperatures. SO-1B results did not fit the solubility model, having a high Chi2 value, and thus were not included. CE model fits that intersect the Ta+1.5 line provide unreasonably high recharge elevations (greater than [>] 3,000 m) for some sites, so the Ta line was used for the recharge temperatures in this study. Well samples that cross the Ta line with good Chi2 model fits (<2.71) using the CE model are listed in table 4. Noble gas recharge temperatures (indicated where CE model values for noble gas recharge cross the Ta line) ranged from 6.2 to 10.9 \u00b0C (table 4; fig. 7). Generally, the water from deep wells has a lower recharge temperature. The recharge temperatures for modeled middle and deep wells (TR-1C, SO-1C, SO-1D, and VA-1C) ranged from 6.2 to 8.8 \u00b0C, whereas recharge temperatures for the shallower wells (VA-1A and VA-1B) were 10.9 and 10.4 \u00b0C, respectively.

R/Ra ratios from this study indicate groundwater has been in contact with crustal material for an appreciable amount of time because the values are less than 1 (White, 2013). Water likely did not enter the aquifer system recently as the R/Ra ratios indicate recharge from deep sources. The N2/Ar ratio was determined for the Southern aquifer- test pumping well (SO-1E) and the water-supply wells RC-3 and RC-5. Using Weiss (1968), approximate nitrogen and argon gas recharge temperatures were calculated (table 4). For RC-3, an approximate recharge temperature of 12.2 \u00b0C was calculated by using an input recharge elevation of 2,150 m above National Geodetic Vertical Datum of 1929, and for RC-5, an approximate recharge temperature of 9.2 \u00b0C was calculated by using an input recharge elevation of 2,500 m above National Geodetic Vertical Datum of 1929. Recharge elevations for RC-3 and RC-5 were estimated from recharge elevations that were determined from the noble gas data analy\u00ad sis for the other samples. Where noble gas data were available, nitrogen and argon recharge temperatures using Weiss (1968) (table 4) were compared to the CE model values for noble gas recharge temperatures (Aeschbach-Hertig and others, 2000). The Weiss (1968) model predicted higher recharge tempera\u00ad tures than the CE model, which may indicate that the actual recharge temperatures for RC-3 and RC-5 are lower than cal\u00ad culated temperatures by a few degrees, as a full suite of noble gases is more robust than the N2/Ar ratio only. The N2/Ar ratio at SO-1E indicates a recharge elevation intermediate between SO-1C and SO-1D (table 4). Physical measurements of water input to the aquifer-test pumping wells (CC-1E and SO-1E) support the conclusion of Travis and Myers (2019) that the majority of water contributed to these wells is from the middle and deep zones. Carbon Isotopes In the sentinel wells, aquifer-test pumping wells, and water-supply wells, the \u03b413C values ranged from \u22127.81 to \u22129.59 (table 5) and varied little as a function of 14C, similar to the observations of Plummer and others (2012) for ground\u00ad water in the Middle Rio Grande Basin. The mean \u03b413C value (table 5) for groundwater from this study was \u22128.76 \u00b1 0.42\u2030, which is similar to the \u22128.2 \u00b1 1.4\u2030 mean for groundwater in the basin with radiocarbon ages of greater than 200 years 1 3 5 7 9 11 13 15 17 1,500 1,700 1,900 2,100 2,300 2,500 2,700 2,900 3,100 3,300 3,500 3,700 3,900 4,100 Temperature, in degrees Celsius Elevation, in meters above the North American Vertical Datum of 1988 Elevation of wells Ta Ta + 1.5 Ta + 3 VA-1A VA-1B VA-1C TR-1A TR-1C SO-1A SO-1C SO-1D EXPLANATION Temperature lapse rate (Ta) y = \u20130.0055x + 21.982 Ta Ta + 1.5 Ta +3 Water table Shallow Middle Deep Screened interval Figure 7.

Groundwater with a modern component of water had more depleted values of \u03b413C, with a mean of \u221211.9 \u00b1 2.0\u2030 (Plummer and others, 2012). The \u03b413C and 14C values were plotted (fig. 8) by using the graphical method of Han and Plummer (2016) to understand potential processes influencing carbon water chemistry. The \u201czero age\u201d lines on figure 8 are determined by the 14C and \u03b413C values of the soil gas and solid carbonate (Han and Plummer, 2016), and the area within these \u201czero age\u201d lines is known as the \u201czero age\u201d area. Samples from the water table and shallow sentinel wells plot within the \u201czero age\u201d area, indicating that they have zero radiocarbon age, which may be explained by geochemical reaction with no radiocarbon decay. In contrast, Bexfield and others (2012) modeled groundwater from shal\u00ad low and intermediate wells to have radiocarbon ages. The Han and Plummer (2016) graphical method can be biased to predict younger ages when plotting in the \u201czero age\u201d area, as well as biased to predict older ages when plotting below the \u201czero age\u201d area. However, the general ages indicated by the graphical method are indicative of the differing source waters in these wells. Samples from the middle and deep sentinel wells, aquifer-test pumping wells, and water-supply wells plot in the region below the \u201czero age\u201d area, indicating that they are old waters that have undergone 14C decay (fig. 8; Han and others, 2012; Han and Plummer, 2016). Radiocarbon age was computed for samples having 14C values less than 50 pmC by using the revised F&G solid ex model (11) in NetpathXL (Parkhurst and Charlton, 2008), which uses input values of 100 pmC for soil gas and 0 pmC for solid carbonate (Han and Plummer, 2013). To calculate the \u201czero age\u201d line, a soil gas \u03b413C value of \u221217\u2030 was used, which was the 75th percentile of soil gas samples collected in the Middle Rio Grande Basin by Plummer and others (2012), and a solid carbonate value of \u22124.45\u2030 was used, which was a mean solid carbonate value of samples collected from the Santa Fe Group in the Central Zone (Plummer and others, 2012, table C2). Radiocarbon ages were calculated for soil gas values of \u221212 and \u221220\u2030, to provide a range of possible values, and a carbonate value of \u22124.45\u2030; the range of values is presented in table 5. Tritium Tritium is a useful tracer for determining if there is a component of water recharged during the period of nuclear bomb testing in the United States in the 1950s and 1960s, which released tritium into the atmosphere.

As a result, groundwater tritium concentrations can qualitatively indi\u00ad cate groundwater age. Tritium concentrations in the samples ranged from less than detection to 0.84 picocurie per liter (pCi/L) (table 5). The concentrations are very low and indicate minimal to no presence of modern water (using a conservative threshold for modern water of 1.3 pCi/L, which is equivalent to 4.19 tritium units [Beisner and others, 2017]). Tritium values were not available for samples from TR-1B and TR-1C, the aquifer-test pumping wells, or the water-supply wells. Chlorofluorocarbons CFCs were created in the 1930s, and CFC concentra\u00ad tions began to increase in the atmosphere starting in the 1940s. The presence of CFC compounds (CFC-11, CFC-12, CFC-113) in water can indicate the contribution of water recharged after 1940. Additionally, the ratio of the CFC compounds has changed in the atmosphere over time, with the ratio of CFC-113/CFC-12 increasing during the 1980s. CFC results from wells in this study are summarized in table 6. Concentration ranges were 0.011\u20132.075 picomoles per kilo\u00ad gram (pmol/kg) for CFC-12, 0.034\u20131.722 pmol/kg for CFC-11, and 0.003\u20130.305 pmol/kg for CFC-113. The concentrations of CFC-113 (International Atomic Energy Agency, 2006) indi\u00ad cate a small percentage of modern water may be present at RC-3 and RC-5 (about 2\u20135 percent) and SO-1B and SO-1D (about 7\u201317 percent) (table 6). The CFC-113/CFC-12 ratio indicates that the fraction of modern water at the wells has an approximate recharge year of 1977\u201382 for RC-3, 1985\u201388 for RC-5, 1984 for SO-1B, and 1979\u201380 for SO-1D. Two or more samples from these wells indicated the presence of modern water. Other samples from these wells did not have a possible ratio of CFC-113/CFC-12, assuming the compounds originated from air-equilibrated water, or only had one sample replicate that indicated a small presence (table 6).

Groundwater evolution is described in this section, as well as shifting groundwater flow direction and a comparison of hydrochemi\u00ad cal zones of the groundwater. Groundwater Evolution The sentinel wells were constructed to monitor discrete intervals within the Santa Fe Group aquifer system that are the primary contributors of groundwater to water-supply wells; therefore, data from these wells can be used to determine the primary production zone(s) within the screened intervals of the supply wells. The Southern aquifer-test pumping well (SO-1E) is similar to the water-supply wells (RC-3, RC-4, and RC-5) as, prior to grouting, it was screened through the water table (SO-1A), shallow (SO-1B), middle (SO-1C), and deep (SO-1D) aquifer zones (fig. 2, table 1). As the Southern sentinel well nest has the most complete dataset, the following discussion will focus on that well nest, along with data from SO-1E. Although the analytical data from the other sentinel well nests support the following discussion with similar con\u00ad clusions, the results are not discussed in detail here. Thus, this discussion focuses on the evolution of groundwater at one well nest, although other well data are added to the discussion on occasion to provide stronger supporting evidence. The major ion composition in the shallow well is different than in the water table, middle, deep, and aquifer-test pumping wells. In general, groundwater in the shallow well has higher percentages of bicarbonate, sodium, and potassium, and lower percentages of sulfate and calcium (fig. 3). Concentration ranges were also higher in the shallow and water table wells, including greater maximum concentrations of nitrate and sodium and lower silica and potassium than the middle and deep wells (fig. 4). To further differentiate groundwaters and to investigate potential ion sources, stochiometric relations were explored, including data from other sentinel well nests (fig. 9). Groundwater in the shallow wells at Southern (SO-1B) and VA (VA-1A) and water table wells at Trumbull (TR-1A) has dis\u00ad tinctly higher sodium relative to chloride (fig. 9A). This may indicate (1) additional sodium input from cation exchange; (2) weathering of sodium aluminosilicates such as plagioclase (NaAlSiO3O8; suggested by Plummer and others, 2012); or possibly (3) anthropogenic inputs such as sewer wastewater (Panno and others, 2006). Given the higher silica content in the middle, deep, and aquifer-test pumping wells (fig. 4), anthropogenic inputs seem more likely to explain excess sodium in the shallow wells. Concentrations of arsenic, silica, and potassium are higher in the deeper wells, likely because of increased groundwater residence time (figs. 4 and 8) and the weathering of potassium feldspar and volcanic lithic fragments in the alluvium of the Santa Fe Group (Anderholm, 1988; Linhoff and others, 2016). Other potential sources of arsenic in the Middle Rio Grande Basin include adsorption/desorption processes involving iron oxides or mixing with mineralized water of deep origin (Bexfield and Plummer, 2003). Waters influenced by carbonate dissolution are expected to plot along a 1:2 line (fig. 9B) of calcium plus magnesium versus bicarbonate (Drever, 1988). However, most waters plotted above this line, indicating that carbonate dissolu\u00ad tion is not controlling the major ion chemistry of most wells sampled, except for the shallow wells. Relative to much of the Middle Rio Grande Basin, water in the water table and shal\u00ad low wells has elevated nitrate concentrations (Plummer and others, 2012) potentially as a result of anthropogenic waste\u00ad water (Menci\u00f3 and others, 2016). Samples from the shallow and water table wells have distinctly higher NO3/Na ratios (fig. 9C) relative to the rest of the sampling suite, including samples from the water-supply wells. Samples from these shallow wells were oxygenated (fig. 4), implying that nitrate reduction likely is not presently occurring. The lower nitrate concentrations in the deeper wells may be due to more reduc\u00ad ing conditions (fig. 4), which would promote nitrate reduction and removal. The elevated nitrate in the shallow aquifer likely has an anthropogenic source such as leaky infrastructure, irrigation, or both (Roy and others, 1999; Menci\u00f3 and oth\u00ad ers, 2016). Chloride to bromide (chloride/bromide) ratios can be indicative of solute sources (Davis and others, 1998) and could be used to differentiate shallow from deeper wells. Samples from water table wells have chloride/bromide ratios of 73 to 127 (fig. 10), and samples from shallow wells have a slightly higher range of ratios, generally ranging from 73 to 210, with one well (CC-1B) having a chloride/bromide ratio of 303. The chloride concentrations range from 8 to 68 mg/L in the water table and shallow wells. The lower chloride/bromide ratios in the water table and shallow groundwater is likely due to surface recharge bringing solutes from the unsaturated zone (Bexfield and others, 2012). The lower chloride/bro\u00ad mide ratios could also indicate a nonseptic wastewater source (Davis and others, 1998), although this ratio is not always a reliable tracer of anthropogenic wastewater (Panno and others, 2006). The chloride/bromide ratios are higher in the middle, deep, aquifer-test pumping, and water-supply wells, ranging from 173 to 413, and the chloride concentrations are slightly higher, on average, than the other wells, ranging from 23 to 69 mg/L. These values are similar to the ratios and concen\u00ad trations for deep wells as reported by Bexfield and others (2012), who suggested that the results could reflect a fraction of relatively mineralized groundwater from a deep source.

Mex. is more similar to water from middle and deep sentinel wells than water from water table or shallow sentinel wells (fig. 10). Water obtained from aquifer-test pumping wells in 2016, after the deeper portion of their screens had been plugged, moved from the upper to the middle range of values for the chloride/ bromide ratios and for chloride concentrations. Stable isotopes (\u03b42H and \u03b418O) often reflect conditions of groundwater recharge as the isotopes in atmospheric moisture systematically change via Rayleigh distillation as air masses move away from source areas and cool and condense to precipitate as rain or snow (Craig, 1961; Rozanski and others, 1993). For the Southern sentinel well nest, stable isotopes were most depleted in the middle and deep wells, ranging from \u221291.6 to \u221296.9\u2030 \u03b42H (fig. 5). The depletion is indicative of recharge by seepage from the Rio Grande, which is sourced from high-elevation snowmelt. Stable isotopes in the shallow and water table wells were less depleted, ranging from \u221279.6 to \u221282.6\u2030 \u03b42H (fig. 5), indicating likely recharge from the mountain front. The aquifer-test pumping well was sampled in 2015 and in 2016, before and after the well was grouted to a shallower depth which closed off the deeper portion of the well screen. Stable isotopes were substantially less depleted in the sample from 2016 (\u221287.4\u2030 \u03b42H) relative to the sample from 2015 (\u221296.6\u2030 \u03b42H), consistent with the removal of a substantial contribution of water from deeper zones at this site. This is only the case with the Southern wells. Stable isotopes in the other shallow and water table sentinel wells are more depleted, indicating recharge from the Rio Grande, and supporting the conclusion that the study area is likely near a transition in recharge sources. Recharge temperature calculated by using the CE model (Aeschbach-Hertig and others, 2000) indicated that the deep well (SO-1D) has a cooler recharge temperature of 6.5 \u00b0C relative to the middle well, which had a warmer recharge temperature of 8.8 \u00b0C (table 4). These results were supported by the analysis of nitrogen and argon using the Weiss model (Weiss, 1968). Although the Weiss model predicted warmer temperatures than the CE model, the Weiss model nitrogen and argon gas recharge temperatures (table 4) were still cooler for the deep well (7.8 \u00b0C) than the middle well (10.3 \u00b0C). Additionally, a Weiss model temperature of 8.9 \u00b0C was calculated for groundwater in the aquifer-test pumping well, which is cooler than in the middle well but warmer than in the deep well. Carbon isotope analysis indicated that the water table and shallow wells produced relatively young waters having no radiocarbon decay, and the middle, deep, and aquifer-test pumping wells produced older waters (fig. 8). Tritium con\u00ad centrations were very low and indicated a minimal or nonex\u00ad istent component of modern water for all the wells. CFC-113/ CFC-12 ratios for SO-1B and SO-1D indicated that there may be a small amount of modern water present. Although there appear to be distinct differences in the sources and ages of groundwater from the sentinel wells screened above (water table, shallow), between (middle) and below (deep) the confining A1 and A2 clay units, the aquifer-test pumping well provides a unique opportunity to evaluate which interval is the most productive to a well screened through all of the intervals (water table, shallow, middle, and deep), and to demonstrate how the chemistry of groundwater produced"

Under pumping conditions, flow logging indicated that the aquifer-test pump\u00ad ing well draws 65 percent of its total flow into the well from below the A1 unit and 18 percent from between the A1 and A2 units (Travis and Myers, 2019). The aquifer-test pumping well data indicated that the well, which is constructed similarly to the water-supply wells, is likely pulling more water from the middle and deep intervals than from the shallow interval but is also likely a mix of the waters from all of the intervals. Determining Primary Aquifer Zones Contributing to Water-Supply Wells By comparing geochemical, isotopic, and age data col\u00ad lected at the nearby sentinel wells to data collected from the water-supply wells in the late 1990s and in 2013, the source of groundwater being withdrawn by the water-supply wells (RC-3, RC-4, and RC-5) can be inferred. Table 7 provides a summary of the conclusions reached regarding recharge sources and groundwater age based on analytical results. The dominant cation in the water-supply wells is calcium, and the dominant anion is bicarbonate, but the bicarbonate in the water-supply wells was not as high as the bicarbonate in the shallow wells and was more similar to the bicarbonate in the middle and deep sentinel wells and aquifer-test pumping wells (fig. 3). Ranges in water-supply wells for some trace elements and major ions, including arsenic, and potassium, are more similar to the ranges found in the water table, shallow, and middle sentinel wells than in the deep wells (fig. 4). There is little to no nitrate present in the water-supply wells, and the chloride/bromide ratios are similar to those in the middle and deep sentinel wells and aquifer-test pumping wells (fig. 10). Stable isotope data collected from the water-supply wells in the late 1990s by Plummer and others (2012) indicated that RC-3 was located at an isotopic shift from mountain-front recharge (\u221280 to \u221285\u2030 \u03b42H) to Rio Grande seepage recharge (\u221290 to \u2212100\u2030 \u03b42H) (fig. 6). The 2013 stable isotope data from RC-3 indicated that those lines of equal \u03b42H composi\u00ad tion (fig. 6) may be shifting, as groundwater from RC-3 has become more depleted (fig. 5), which indicates that the recharge source may be shifting from primarily the moun\u00ad tain front (\u221285.9\u2030 \u03b42H in 1996) to the Rio Grande (\u221290.5\u2030 \u03b42H in 2013). In general, the middle and deep sentinel wells and aquifer-test pumping wells and RC-4 and RC-5 were more depleted than mountain front recharge (fig. 5), indicat\u00ad ing the Rio Grande is the primary recharge source for those wells. The Southern water table and shallow wells, as well as RC-3, may still be near a transition in recharge sources (mountain-front recharge versus Rio Grande seepage recharge; fig. 6), and recharge source may not be a clear indicator of Identification of Primary Zone of Contribution From Groundwater 21 the source of water to the water-supply wells in this area of shifting recharge sources. Dissolved nitrogen and argon gas were analyzed in groundwater from RC-3 and RC-5, and the recharge temperatures, using the Weiss (1968) model, were calculated as 12.2 \u00b0C for RC-3 and 9.2 \u00b0C for RC-5 (table 4). Where the recharge temperature for RC-5 is more aligned with the Southern middle, deep, and aquifer-test pumping wells, the recharge temperature of RC-3 is similar to the warmer recharge temperatures modeled in the VA-1A (shallow) and VA-1B (middle) sentinel wells. Although the VA wells are far\u00ad ther from the water-supply wells, it could be an indicator that the water-supply wells are mixing shallow and deeper waters. Carbon isotope analysis for wells RC-3 and RC-5 indicated that the water-supply wells are dominated by old waters that have undergone 14C decay (fig. 8, table 5) and are similar to the middle and deep sentinel wells and the aquifer-test pump\u00ad ing wells. The borehole flow-logging data from Bexfield and others (2012), collected in a well located approximately 5,630 m west of the sentinel well study area, indicated that the upper intervals contributed the most water to that water-supply well, but Travis and Myers (2019) showed that the deeper intervals were contributing the most water to the aquifer-test pumping wells of this study. The results of the current study indicate that the water-supply wells within the study area produce groundwater from multiple intervals in each well and also that they likely produce more groundwater from the deeper intervals that are below the extent of the EDB plume (USACE, 2017). Given that carbon isotope data indicate the groundwa\u00ad ter is older and has undergone 14C decay, the amount of young water in the water-supply wells, which CFCs indicate is pres\u00ad ent in the water table and shallow wells, is likely minimal.

The Eastern Mountain-Front zone is characterized by groundwater consistent with precipitation- driven infiltration, calcium and bicarbonate dominant water, low concentrations of minor elements, less depleted \u03b42H (median value of \u221281.0\u2030), and lower 14C activity (median value of 47.2 pmC). The Central zone has calcium (or mixed cation) and bicarbonate dominant water, as well as elevated concentrations of potassium and silica; the \u03b42H (median value of \u221295.4\u2030) is lighter and indicative of Rio Grande seep\u00ad age recharge, and the 14C activity is higher (median value of 61.0 pmC). The study area is in two of the hydrochemical zones delineated in Plummer and others (2012), and the sentinel well nests and water-supply well locations are divided by these two zones (fig. 6). The Trumbull, Cesar Chavez, and VA sentinel wells and water-supply well RC-5 are located in the Central hydrochemical zone. Water-supply well RC-3 is located in the Eastern Mountain-Front hydrochemical zone. Water-supply well RC-4 and the Southern sentinel wells are very near the line between the Central and Eastern Mountain-Front zones. The study area extends across the relatively steep gradient in stable isotopes that helped to define the hydrochemical zones (fig. 6). In a previous study (Bexfield and Anderholm, 2002), groundwater in several wells (including RC-4 and RC-5) in the Central zone located just north of KAFB was noted to have an unusual chemical composition and higher chloride concentrations, which were thought to be due to upwelling of mineralized water deep in the aquifer system. Recent studies have shown that although groundwa\u00ad ter flow in the Santa Fe Group is generally southward, near the BFF, historical pumping by water-supply wells caused groundwater to flow to the northeast toward lower water levels starting in about 1980 (Powell and McKean, 2014; Rice and others, 2014). In 2008, groundwater pumping decreased as surface water was used to supplement the Albuquerque water supply, and since that time, groundwater levels in southeastern Albuquerque have been rising (Powell and McKean, 2014). Ritchie and others (2019) calculated that since 2008, water levels have risen in the study area anywhere from 6.1 to 9.1 m. With the increase in water levels and shifts in groundwater flow direction, the hydrochemical zones and lines of equal isotopic composition could be shifting, as indicated by the recent results for RC-3. With the rise in groundwater levels and the shifting groundwater flow directions resulting from reduced pumping for municipal supply, additional sampling may be beneficial to better understand changes occurring in the groundwater system. 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 400 450 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 Chloride to bromide ratio Chloride concentration, in milligrams per liter VA-1A VA-1B VA-1C TR-1A Water table Shallow Middle Deep Screened throughout all intervals TR-1B TR-1C SO-1A SO-1B SO-1C SO-1D SO-1E CC-1A CC-1B CC-1C CC-1D CC-1E Water-supply well Aquifer-test pumping wells Sentinel wells Screened interval EXPLANATION SO-1E 2016 RC-3 1996 RC-3 1997 CC-1E 2016 RC-3 2013 RC-4 1997 RC-5 2013 SO-1E 2015 CC-1E 2015 Figure 10.

Mex. clay units. Wells were sampled for major ions, trace elements, stable isotopes, dissolved gases, tritium, carbon isotopes, and chlorofluorocarbons. Evapotranspiration, land-use practices, water sources, and groundwater flow paths likely explain geochemical variations observed between varying aquifer depths in the Middle Rio Grande Basin. The general chemical composition of ground\u00ad water from all but two shallow wells was predominantly cal\u00ad cium and bicarbonate/carbonate. Groundwater in the Veteran's Administration (VA) and Southern shallow sentinel wells was more dominated by sodium and bicarbonate/carbonate. Relative to the shallow and water table wells, the middle and deep sentinel wells and aquifer-test pumping wells generally had evidence of longer groundwater residence times within the aquifer and had higher concentrations of trace elements resulting from weathering of materials in the aquifer system. Concentrations of arsenic, silica, and potassium were higher in the middle and deep sentinel wells and the aquifer-test pump\u00ad ing wells than in the shallow and water table wells. Samples from the shallow and water table wells had higher concentra\u00ad tions of nitrate than those from the deeper wells. The chloride/ bromide ratios in the shallow and water table wells were lower than the middle, deep, aquifer-test pumping, and water-supply wells, perhaps indicating different solute sources for the shal\u00ad lower wells. The stable isotopes were more depleted, indicat\u00ad ing recharge originating as seepage from the Rio Grande, in the middle, deep, aquifer-test pumping, and water-supply wells compared with the shallower wells. However, the study area is located near a shift from river seepage recharge to mountain-front recharge. Therefore, Southern water table and shallow wells, along with RC-3, may be receiving mountain- front recharge, which is less depleted in stable isotopes than recharge from the Rio Grande. Dissolved gas data indicated that the middle, deep, and aquifer-test pumping wells had lower recharge temperatures than the water table and shal\u00ad low wells. The water-supply wells had recharge temperatures that were similar to those in the middle and deeper wells. Carbon isotopes indicated water was older in the middle, deep, aquifer-test pumping, and water-supply wells than in the shal\u00ad low sentinel wells. The ratio of nitrogen to argon (N2/Ar), carbon and stable isotopes and results of past flow-logging analysis indicate the water-supply wells likely produce groundwater from the mid\u00ad dle and deeper portions of the aquifer system that are below the A2 clay unit. However, some of the geochemical data indicate that there may be some modern water with a shorter residence time entering the wells. With the rise in groundwater levels and the shifting groundwater flow directions resulting from reduced pumping for municipal supply, additional sam\u00ad pling may be beneficial to better understand changes occurring in the groundwater system.
