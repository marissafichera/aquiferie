"The excerpt does not explicitly state its title. Based on its focus on the “unit of Isleta well #2” and late Oligocene faulting in the northwestern Albuquerque Basin, the study is very likely something along the lines of “Late Oligocene Faulting and Erosion in the Northwestern Albuquerque Basin: Evidence from the Isleta Well #2.” However, the exact title is not given in the text provided.","From the formations described (Arroyo Ojito, Cerro Conejo, Zia, etc.), all of which are subdivisions of the Santa Fe Group in this area, it appears the study primarily focuses on the Santa Fe Group aquifer system.","They do present cross sections and correlations (the “stratigraphic fence diagrams”), but there is no clear indication in the text that they produced or published a true 2D (map-view) delineation of the aquifer’s areal extent. Most of the discussion focuses on vertical and cross-sectional correlations rather than explicitly defining a lateral boundary in plan view.","From the information provided, there is no explicit statement that the authors pinpointed or formally defined a specific “base” to the aquifer. The well logs and formation descriptions show how far the drilling and cuttings data extend (e.g., down into the Menefee Formation), but the text does not indicate that they declared a definitive aquifer base. Consequently, it does not appear that the study used any particular data (such as a lithologic boundary or geophysical signature) to fix the base of the aquifer.","There is no mention in the provided text of any published digital product that delineates the aquifer’s full extent. The references discuss well logs, analog data, and stratigraphic correlations, but do not explicitly indicate that a digital map or model of the aquifer boundary was produced or released.","Yes. The authors subdivided the aquifer into stratigraphic units (e.g., Zia Formation, Arroyo Ojito Formation, etc.) and identified their hydrostratigraphic attributes by correlating outcrop descriptions with well cuttings (e.g., lithologic composition, bedding, cementation, color), thus defining how water-bearing intervals and confining layers are distributed.","No. The excerpt focuses on the stratigraphy (e.g., lithology, formation correlations) rather than structural features; it does not describe or define faults or other structural elements that would control groundwater flow. Consequently, there is no specific mention of data used to delineate such structural controls.","No. The sections provided do not describe or delineate recharge or discharge zones. They focus on stratigraphy, lithology, and correlations between various formations rather than discussing groundwater flow or identifying specific recharge or discharge areas.","No. The sections provided do not discuss or quantify aquifer recharge or discharge rates and do not present data on water budget calculations or groundwater flow. They focus on stratigraphy, lithology, and depositional history rather than hydrologic measurements.","No. The report sections presented do not indicate that the study produced any water table elevation, depth‐to‐water, piezometric surface, or potentiometric surface maps.","It is not stated outright, but the report implies that water‐level information (e.g., from the Tamara #1‐Y and other wells), borehole geophysical logs, and drilling data (cuttings) would have been used to construct any water‐table or potentiometric maps. Essentially, measured well depths to groundwater and associated geophysical logs from these wells form the likely data sources for those maps.","The sections provided do not mention the collection or compilation of groundwater‐level data. They focus on lithology, stratigraphy, and petrology rather than water‐level measurements. Therefore, it is not stated whether the study gathered its own water‐level data, used external sources, or both.","No. The sections provided primarily discuss lithology, stratigraphy, and sedimentology; they do not present or analyze water quality data.","They performed new analyses of drill‐hole cuttings (e.g., the Tamara #1‐Y well) for this study but also integrated and compared those results with data and formations described in earlier publications. Thus, some data are new and some come from previously published sources.","No explicit water quality data sources are mentioned in the excerpt. All discussion focuses on lithology, stratigraphy, and petrography of cuttings from various wells. Based on standard practice, any water quality data would most likely come from analyses of water samples or geophysical log interpretations in these same wells (e.g., Tamara #1-Y, Santa Fe Pacific #1, and Santa Fe Pacific #3), but the text provides no direct details about such data.","No. The excerpt focuses on lithologic descriptions, stratigraphic correlations, and petrographic data rather than quantitative hydrogeologic parameters. It does not provide values or detailed discussions of porosity, permeability, storage coefficients, specific storage, specific yield, hydraulic conductivity, or transmissivity.",N/A,"From the available section, the authors do not explicitly list future work. However, the study implies several recommended directions based on its emphasis on stratigraphic relationships, faulting phases, and basin evolution:

1. More Detailed Mapping and Correlation:  
   • Conduct additional field mapping of the Abiquiu and Zia Formations to refine contact relationships and unit boundaries.  
   • Extend these correlations into adjacent structural blocks to better document thickness changes and fault offsets.  

2. Expanded Subsurface Data Collection:  
   • Obtain and analyze more drill-hole data and well logs (similar to the Tamara #1-Y well) across the northwestern Albuquerque Basin.  
   • Compare lithologic cuttings, geophysical logs, and any available core samples to refine the pre-Zia chronology.  

3. Geochronology and Geochemistry:  
   • Perform more precise age dating (e.g., radiometric dating of tuffs, magnetostratigraphy) to clarify deposition timelines and confirm correlations between the Abiquiu and Zia Formations.  
   • Use geochemical fingerprinting of volcanic and sedimentary units to link them across fault blocks.  

4. Structural and Basin Evolution Modeling:  
   • Incorporate new map and subsurface data into structural models to assess the proposed late Oligocene faulting and erosion phase.  
   • Evaluate how these faults and thickness variations relate to the inferred inversion of tilt polarity and the shift in subsidence locus proposed by earlier studies.  

These steps would help resolve outstanding questions on the timing and processes behind basin development and the transition from Laramide compression to Rio Grande rift extension.",58_p0195_p0208.pdf
The title of the study is “Mapping Suitability for Managed Aquifer Recharge in the Albuquerque Basin.”,They focus primarily on the axial-river facies (QTsa) of the Sierra Ladrones Formation as the main aquifer in the study area.,"Yes. Although they ultimately built a 3D geologic model, the report includes 2D maps (for example, Figures 11 and 14) showing the potentiometric surface and depth to groundwater, effectively defining the aquifer’s lateral extent in plan view.","No. The provided sections do not describe or define the base of the aquifer. They focus on infiltration rates, vertical hydraulic conductivity, and the potentiometric surface but do not address how or whether the base of the aquifer was determined.","None of the listed references explicitly describe a downloadable or otherwise disseminated digital product (e.g., GIS shapefile) that defines the aquifer’s areal extent. Several sources include maps, hydrogeologic frameworks, and geophysical interpretations, but no reference directly indicates the release of a digital dataset specifically delineating aquifer boundaries.","Yes. They identified ten hydrostratigraphic units based on geologic mapping by Connell (2008b, 2008a) and Connell et al. (1998), supplemented by well-log data and wireline logs (including lithologic picks and hydraulic conductivity estimates) to characterize each unit’s subsurface properties.","Yes. The study created a 3D geologic model (structural contour maps) to account for fault planes and dips. They used lithologic unit data from Connell (2008b) (in a “Wellpoint” GIS feature class) and manually contoured the bases of hydrostratigraphic units in ArcMap. These structural contour maps, along with fault-plane data (assumed dips of 67º), were then used to define subsurface structural controls on groundwater flow.","From the sections provided, the authors focus on where recharge can occur (e.g., “recharge windows,” mountain‐front reaches, and floodplain sites), but they do not explicitly delineate “discharge zones.” They use soil‐survey data (USDA Soil Survey boundaries, drainage characteristics, soil hydraulic conductivity), subsurface geologic properties (clay content, depth to water table), slope data, and infiltration modeling (the Hantush equation for groundwater mounding, percolation‐time estimates) to map out areas most suitable for shallow‐based recharge. Thus, while they clearly define potential recharge areas, they do not map discrete discharge zones.","No. The report excerpts do not provide an explicit total recharge or discharge rate. They compile and discuss pump‐test and infiltration data (e.g., from AMEC and Daniel B. Stephens & Associates) to characterize hydraulic conductivities and infiltration rates, but they do not present a quantified recharge or discharge amount for the study area.",They produced both a potentiometric‐surface map (Figure 11 in the report) and a depth‐to‐groundwater map (derived from subtracting the potentiometric‐surface elevation from the land‐surface elevation).,"They combined (1) the 2012 USGS potentiometric‐surface contours from Powell and McKean (2014), (2) groundwater‐level measurements from the USGS (A. Galanter, personal communication, 2018), and (3) the NM Office of the State Engineer’s Water Rights Reporting System (WRRS). They used non‐pumping well data (primarily 2011–2013, plus some 2010–2016) measured from November through February (when aquifer levels recover). These data were then interpolated via a regularized spline function in ArcGIS, contoured at 20‐ft intervals, and adjusted based on local geologic constraints.","They did not collect new water‐level measurements themselves; rather, they incorporated and synthesized groundwater data already produced by the USGS, the State Engineer’s Water Rights Reporting System, and other existing sources.","No. The sections focus on geologic, hydrologic, and soil considerations for managed aquifer recharge but do not mention collecting or analyzing water quality data.","Most of the information was compiled from existing sources (such as Connell’s mapping and Powell and McKean’s previous contouring), then supplemented and extended (for example, analyzing wireline logs to refine subsurface conditions). So, while some new analysis was performed, the foundational data came largely from prior work.","Primary water‐quality data are drawn from:  
• The University of New Mexico Department of Civil Engineering’s final report on groundwater contamination for Bernalillo County (F R 6 0 5 Volume I).  
• Several U.S. Geological Survey Water‐Resources Investigations Reports (Thorn and Heywood, 2000; Thorn et al., 1993; Wilkins, 1987) that include water‐quality testing and aquifer evaluations.  
• Wamsley (2014), which documents contamination linked to on‐site wastewater systems.","They report hydraulic conductivity data (see Table 2 in the excerpt) and discuss thicknesses of permeable zones, but the text does not explicitly provide other properties such as porosity, specific yield, or storage coefficients. It does note that data needed to assess hydrogeologic properties were compiled, but the only quantitative property clearly called out in the excerpt is hydraulic conductivity.","They were derived from documented pump test data coupled with infiltration testing from consultant reports, with each well’s screened interval tied to a specific hydrostratigraphic unit (≥75% of the screen intersecting that unit). Infiltration rates (falling head method) and other parameters (e.g., storage coefficient, specific yield, vertical conductivity) came from published studies and the single Duranes 4 well test.","Based on the methods and findings described, the study could benefit from several follow-up efforts to refine or expand upon the work. Although explicit recommendations are not stated in the text, the following suggestions derive logically from the methods and data gaps identified:

1. Collect site-specific field data and validate assumptions:
   • Conduct additional infiltration and pump tests to validate the assumptions about hydraulic conductivity and injection rates for both deep and shallow recharge methods.  
   • Perform pilot-scale recharge experiments at selected high-suitability sites to confirm modeled performance and obtain real-world data on infiltration, injection rates, and water-table response.

2. Increase resolution and update geologic interpretations:
   • Expand wireline log and well-data analyses to refine estimates of clay, sand, or other sedimentary layers that control storage-zone thickness and transmissivity.  
   • Update structural and geologic models as new or more detailed well and outcrop data become available.  

3. Monitor dynamic groundwater conditions:
   • Periodically re-map depth to groundwater to capture changes in water-table elevation (for example, following managed recharge or changing pumping patterns).  
   • Evaluate how shifting groundwater levels might alter optimal recharge locations over time.

4. Refine and extend weighted-overlay criteria:  
   • Incorporate additional factors (e.g., new cost data, water rights considerations, or updated contamination constraints) that might affect recharge feasibility.  
   • Conduct a formal sensitivity analysis on the weights to assess how much each criterion influences the overall suitability map.

5. Assess soil hydrocompaction risk more thoroughly:
   • Perform site inspections or small-scale loading tests in areas mapped with moderate or high hydrocompaction susceptibility to confirm model predictions.  
   • Consider potential mitigation strategies (e.g., prewetting or engineered fill) for areas with high infiltration potential but also high collapse susceptibility.

6. Expand geographic coverage and stakeholder collaboration:
   • Explore broader regions within Bernalillo County or nearby areas with similar geologic conditions to identify additional MAR opportunities.  
   • Coordinate with local authorities (e.g., ABCWUA) to track infrastructure changes, wellfield development, and evolving policy constraints that might affect MAR suitability.

These steps would help refine the current maps, provide ground truth to modeled assumptions, and ensure that MAR planning remains aligned with ongoing hydrologic and infrastructural changes in the Albuquerque Basin.",OFR-605_ABQMAR_report.pdf
"It is referred to simply as “Open-File Report 632.” The text does not give a longer formal title, so based on the excerpt, the study is most likely titled “Open-File Report 632.”","Based on references (such as Bexfield and Anderholm, 2000), the study is focused on the Santa Fe Group aquifer system underlying the Middle Rio Grande Basin.","Yes. The study clipped its interpolations to the same boundary used in earlier water‐level maps (Falk et al., 2011; Galanter & Curry, 2019), effectively defining the aquifer’s areal extent (in two dimensions) for this work.","No. The report does not specifically define the base of the aquifer. It mentions the “production zone” extending from about 300 to 1,100 feet or more below land surface, but does not describe how any deeper boundary or “base” of the aquifer was determined.","No. The report indicates they used the existing study‐area boundary from prior work (for example, Galanter and Curry, 2019) and clipped results to that boundary. It does not mention releasing a new digital product that specifically defines the aquifer extent.","No. The report does not present a new or detailed definition of the aquifer’s hydrostratigraphy. Rather, it relies on the production‐zone definition given by Falk et al. (2011)—“the interval … about 300 feet below land surface to 1,100 feet or more below land surface, in which production wells generally are screened”—but does not introduce new stratigraphic data to redefine or refine that interval.","No. The sections provided do not describe subsurface structural controls on groundwater flow or indicate the use of data to define them. The focus is on water‐level measurements, well selection, and interpolation methods rather than detailed subsurface structural elements.","No. The report sections do not explicitly delineate recharge or discharge zones. They focus on water-level measurement, interpolation, and storage-change estimation. There is no direct discussion or data specifically used to define recharge or discharge areas.","No. The report only estimates overall storage change in the aquifer (by multiplying water-level changes by a specific yield factor). It does not directly measure or report recharge or discharge rates or amounts; rather, it focuses on net water-level changes and the resulting change in aquifer storage.","From the text, the study clearly produced a water‐level (water‐table) elevation map of the production zone of the aquifer rather than a depth‐to‐water or other type of map. The final result is described explicitly as a “water‐level surface” (i.e., a water‐table elevation map).","They were derived from a set of water‐level measurements collected between November 1, 2022, and March 1, 2023, primarily from 89 USGS wells, 1 NMBGMR well, and 174 monitoring wells at KAFB (of which 5 were selected to represent that cluster). After removing pumping‐flagged data and retaining the highest water level in the time window for each well, the final dataset contained 49 wells. Water levels near the Rio Grande were assigned based on measured wells within about 750 meters of the river and interpolated along the river centerline. These combined measurements were then used in a regression kriging approach to produce the mapped water‐level surface.","Both. New water-level measurements were gathered during the time window (November 1, 2022, to March 1, 2023), and these data were also compiled from existing sources such as the USGS, the NMBGMR, and staff at Kirtland Air Force Base.",No. The sections of the report focus entirely on water-level measurements and changes in groundwater storage. There is no mention of any water-quality sampling or analysis.,"They collected new measurements (manual and continuous) and also compiled data from the USGS, the NMBGMR, and Kirtland Air Force Base to build this report.","No specific water quality data sources are identified in these excerpts. The cited references and discussions focus on water-level mapping, aquifer storage, and related analyses (e.g., ABCWUA reports, USGS investigations, spatiotemporal kriging studies). The text does not explicitly mention or list separate water quality datasets.","They explicitly cite only one hydrogeologic property in the text: the specific yield, assumed to be 0.2. Other properties such as porosity, permeability, storage coefficients, hydraulic conductivity, and transmissivity are not reported.","Specific yield is mentioned in the references (for example, Kennedy and Bell, 2023), where they mapped it in Albuquerque using repeat microgravity data, and by Cederstrand and Becker (1998), who created a digital map of specific yield for the High Plains Aquifer. Otherwise, no further hydrogeologic properties and methods are described in the provided section.","Future work recommendations focus on improving data consistency and accuracy. Specifically, the report emphasizes:  
• Measuring as many wells as possible, ideally the same wells measured in winter 2019–2020, to maintain a consistent dataset.  
• Collecting measurements within the winter time window (November 1–March 1) to reduce seasonal variability.  
• Ensuring repeated measurements at the same set of wells so that observed changes in water levels are not artifacts of altered well networks.  
• Incorporating more detailed spatial estimates of specific yield—ideally, expanding on methods like Kennedy and Bell (2023)—to refine future storage-change calculations.  ",OFR_632.pdf
"The title of the study is “Regional Survey of Structural Properties and Cementation Patterns of Fault Zones in the Northern Part of the Albuquerque Basin, New Mexico—Implications for Ground-Water Flow.”",They focus on the Albuquerque Basin aquifer (often referred to simply as the “Albuquerque aquifer basin”) within the Santa Fe Group sediments.,"The text does not indicate that the authors provided a specific two‐dimensional boundary or “footprint” of the aquifer. They discuss basin boundaries, fault distributions, and general stratigraphy but do not appear to define the aquifer’s areal extent in a strict 2D sense. Instead, they emphasize fault properties, cementation patterns, and structural features within the basin.","No. The sections you provided do not indicate that the study explicitly defines the aquifer’s base, nor do they describe how that boundary might have been determined. They focus on fault geometries, cementation patterns, and sedimentary fill but do not discuss the aquifer’s lower boundary.","None of the cited references specifically indicate that a digital product was published to define the aquifer extent. Although there are maps (for example, Bexfield and Anderholm’s 2000 water-level map) and reports at various scales, none explicitly mention a digital (GIS or similar) publication delineating the aquifer’s boundaries.","No. The report does not present a formal hydrostratigraphic framework. Instead, it characterizes how fault-zone features (for example, fault core widths, cementation, grain size of the host lithology) affect the aquifer’s hydraulic properties. The study’s data come primarily from field observations of fault structures, lithologies, and cements rather than a systematic definition of named hydrostratigraphic units.","Yes. The study correlated observed fault-zone widths, lithology (grain size and induration), fault cores, and damage zones—along with field evidence of fractures and cement distribution— to define structural controls on groundwater flow. These data, including measurements of fault widths, the presence of low-permeability fault cores, and cements that seal or locally channel flow, were used to infer how faults affect subsurface fluid movement. Field observations, along with imaging data (such as InSAR), supported their conclusions.","No. In the provided sections, there is no explicit definition or mapping of recharge and discharge zones. The authors discuss fault geometry, cementation patterns, and implications for groundwater flow but do not identify specific recharge or discharge zones or the data that would establish them.","No. The provided sections do not indicate that recharge or discharge rates were quantified or measured. The report focuses on fault‐zone structures, cementation, and implications for groundwater flow, but does not present data on recharge or discharge rates or amounts.","Yes. At least one produced map is described by Bexfield and Anderholm (2000) as a “Predevelopment water-level map,” which effectively shows the aquifer’s potentiometric (water-level) surface.","From the citations provided—particularly Bexfield and Anderholm (2000)—it appears that water‐level measurements from wells in the Santa Fe Group aquifer system (likely predevelopment measurements) were the primary data source for constructing those water‐table or potentiometric‐surface maps. In other words, they used observations of actual water levels in wells to derive and contour the aquifer’s groundwater elevations.","The sections provided do not state that new water‐level measurements were made during this study; instead, they reference other work (for example, Bexfield and Anderholm, 2000) and methods such as InSAR to assess flow and hydraulic gradients. Thus, it appears that water‐level information was compiled from existing sources rather than collected directly by the authors for this study.","No. The text focuses on fault zone structures, cementation, and implications for ground-water flow but does not present or analyze specific water quality data.","They undertook a dedicated field campaign to collect new fault-zone data (for example, at 176 sites) but also incorporated information from previous mapping and references. Hence, the study’s data are primarily new field observations supported by compiled earlier work.","From the listed references, the most direct sources of water‐quality information are the various U.S. Geological Survey publications (for example, Bartolino and Cole, 2002, USGS Circular 1222) and the Water‐Resources Investigations Reports (such as Bexfield and Anderholm, 2000). These USGS reports typically compile, analyze, or summarize water‐quality datasets for the middle Rio Grande Basin. Additionally, hydrologic framework studies from the New Mexico Bureau of Mines and Mineral Resources (for example, Hawley, 1996) may also include pertinent water‐quality data.","They do discuss permeability and transmissivity in qualitative terms (for example, referring to “very low permeability” cores and “fault zone transmissivity”) but do not present specific measurements or numeric values for these or other hydrogeologic parameters (porosity, storage coefficients, specific yield, hydraulic conductivity). The report primarily addresses how fault structures and cementation influence permeability and fault‐zone transmissivity, rather than providing measured property values.","N/A. The excerpt does not report specific measured (numerical) hydrogeologic properties or how they were determined. It only describes qualitative inferences about permeability, seals, and flow paths based on structural and cementation observations, rather than publishing explicit values or measurement methods.","Based on the discussion in the text, the study does not provide a dedicated “Future Work” section, but it does indicate several areas where additional research would be valuable:

• Critically stressed and refractured faults: The text notes that some cemented faults may be at critically stressed states and could be undergoing renewed fracturing that compromises their ability to act as seals. A logical next step would be to conduct focused field and/or modeling studies (including stress-field analyses and fracture mapping) to evaluate the current state of stress on these faults and to assess how refracturing events might influence groundwater flow.

• Quantification of fault zone transmissivity: The text repeatedly emphasizes the importance of fault cores, mixed zones, and damage zones for controlling permeability. Future work could more directly measure and quantify transmissivity (for example, via pumping tests or core analyses) of these distinct fault zone components in different protoliths.

• Impact of cementation and re-cementation: Cementation in fault zones can shift regions of highest permeability laterally or to other fault segments. Additional research could characterize how multiple generations of cements form, dissolve, or refracture over time, especially under varying stresses and fluid pressures. This would involve petrographic analysis, geochronology of cements, and repeat geophysical surveys to detect changes over time.

• Basin-scale hydrogeologic modeling: The study highlights the need to incorporate fault-zone structure and variability (fault width, cementation, juxtaposed lithologies) into regional flow models. Refined numerical simulations could integrate the presence of strongly cemented fault segments and the anisotropic permeability within damage zones to predict cross-fault versus along-fault flow pathways and to better manage groundwater resources.

• Geophysical monitoring: The text cites InSAR evidence of differential subsidence across faults. Future work could employ continued InSAR or similar remote-sensing techniques to detect and track changes in land-surface elevation over time, thereby identifying zones of potential fault reactivation, fracturing, or fluid-flow variability in the subsurface. This would also help validate or adjust basin-scale flow models as stress conditions change.

Collectively, work in these areas would deepen the understanding of how fault-zone structures evolve under tectonic and hydrologic pressures—and how those changes might affect groundwater flow and aquifer management in the Albuquerque Basin aquifer system.",P1719_508.pdf
"It is not explicitly stated within the excerpts. However, the repeated header “Rio Rancho Technical Report | Dan Koning” suggests that the study may be titled “Rio Rancho Technical Report.”",They focus on the Santa Fe Group aquifer in the Rio Rancho area.,"From the descriptions of the raster “tops” for each hydrostratigraphic unit (Plates 1–4) and the structural contours used in ArcGIS, it is clear they did produce mapped (2D) extents of those aquifer units across the study area. Although their main goal was a 3D geological model, the report also indicates creation of 2D surfaces outlining where each unit (and thus the aquifer) is present laterally.","From the sections provided, the authors do not explicitly identify or map what they consider “the base” of the aquifer. They define four main hydrostratigraphic units and specify the lowest one as the Zia HSU (encompassing the Zia Formation and lower–middle Cerro Conejo). However, they do not detail how or even whether they mapped the boundary below that unit (for example, the contact with older bedrock). Consequently, the report as quoted does not show that they formally defined the aquifer’s base; rather, they focused on mapping and correlating the tops of each HSU using well data (wireline logs, cuttings) and ArcGIS/Kingdom software.","They created a 3D geologic model in ArcGIS (raster surfaces for each hydrostratigraphic unit), but the text does not explicitly state that these digital data were formally published as a standalone product defining the full aquifer extent. Instead, it describes how the model was constructed and notes that plates and appendices contain the mapping outputs.","Yes. They defined hydrostratigraphic units based on their field mapping and combined this with well data (e.g., wireline logs and cuttings). Specifically, they used geologic mapping to hypothesize initial units and then correlated those units between wells using wireline log data and archived cuttings (listed in Table 2) to refine the subsurface model.","Yes. The report shows that faults and thickness changes exert structural controls on groundwater flow. These were defined through inter-well correlations, wireline logs (gamma-ray, resistivity, and porosity data), cuttings data, and the creation of structural contour surfaces in ArcGIS, all of which helped identify fault offsets and correlated subsurface horizons.","Yes. They inferred a major recharge zone in the southeast corner of the study area (near the Rio Grande) based on younger radiocarbon ages, lower TDS, and the westward slope of the potentiometric-elevation surface. In contrast, much older groundwater ages (>20,000 years) in the northwest indicate minimal recharge there. Possible discharge was inferred where faults bounding the Ziana horst appear to expel saline water, based on elevated TDS values and structural mapping.","No. The sections do not show any explicit calculation or measurement of recharge or discharge rates. They focus on assessing aquifer thicknesses, lithologic variations, and permeability parameters (for example, from outcrop mapping and pumping test data), but do not present or discuss specific recharge or discharge amounts.",They produced and updated a potentiometric surface map (as opposed to a simple water table or depth‐to‐water map).,"They used water‐level measurements from wells (both recent data and older data from stock wells), spot elevations for the lower Rio Jemez and Rio Grande (where groundwater is assumed to be near the surface), and topographic elevations (from a digital elevation model) to convert depth‐to‐water readings to water‐level elevations. These data were then input into interpolation and contouring tools (e.g., Natural Neighbor, Topo to Raster) in ArcGIS to generate the potentiometric surface maps.",It appears that the study team incorporated both newly compiled groundwater-level information and older water-level data (from stock wells in some areas) to update the potentiometric surface.,"Yes. The study compiles water quality data, specifically total dissolved solids (TDS) measurements, from various wells as a preliminary indicator of overall water quality.","Much of the study’s information (e.g., hydraulic conductivities, TDS, radiocarbon ages) was compiled from existing sources (e.g., previously completed pump tests, published maps, and well data) rather than newly collected in the field. The authors then integrated and analyzed these compiled datasets to produce the 3D hydrostratigraphic model and related maps.",They come from water chemistry analyses of samples taken from Rio Rancho’s wells—particularly its main pumping wells—as compiled in Appendix 1 of the report.,"From the text, the only explicitly reported properties are permeability and hydraulic conductivity (derived from pumping test data) and specific capacities. The text does not explicitly report porosity, storage coefficients, specific storage, specific yield, or transmissivity.","They were determined through two methods: (1) geologic outcrop mapping to analyze sand, clay, and sand-amalgamation ratios, and (2) compiling pumping test data (i.e., hydraulic conductivities and specific capacities).","Future work recommendations suggested or implied by the report include:

• Refining and extending the 3D geologic model. The current model can serve as a foundation for more detailed studies aimed at calculating groundwater volumes, informing basin-wide water budgets, and developing numerical groundwater-flow models.  
• Conducting additional pumping tests. Particularly in areas where sand content and permeability trends are uncertain—such as north of RRU-9—further testing would confirm the suggested increase in permeability and better characterize aquifer properties in the Middle Rio Rancho HSU.  
• Investigating high-TDS units for possible use. The Lower Rio Rancho HSU and the lower-middle Zia HSU appear to have considerable sand content but locally higher salinity. Evaluations of cost-effective water treatment or blending strategies would help determine if they could serve as viable deep-water aquifers.  
• Evaluating southward facies changes in the Lower Rio Rancho HSU. Additional drilling or geophysical surveys could clarify the extent of finer-grained deposits south of Southern Boulevard and improve understanding of potential impacts on permeability and water quality.  
• Further fault displacement and tectonic history studies. The model’s fault interpretations can be tested by collecting higher-resolution data on fault offsets and integrating these with geochronological results. This would refine both the structural framework and aquifer compartmentalization within the study area.",RioRanchoTechnicalRpt_v10.pdf

The authors discuss how normal fault–bounded half‐graben geometry and intrabasinal faults compartmentalize the basin, thereby influencing groundwater flow. They base these structural interpretations primarily on detailed geologic mapping, fault studies, and stratigraphic/chronologic data (including biostratigraphy, magnetostratigraphy, and 40Ar/39Ar dating) that reveal how the basin fill and fault blocks are arranged in the subsurface.","The excerpt does not explicitly define specific recharge and discharge zones. It mentions the importance of the basin as a groundwater resource and discusses geologic structure and depositional environments, but does not provide detailed data (e.g., water-level measurements, hydrochemical analyses) delineating recharge and discharge areas. Any inference that uplifts or fault-block margins might act as recharge zones and basin centers as discharge zones remains general rather than explicitly defined in this text.","No. The sections presented do not provide any direct measurements or calculations of recharge or discharge rates. They discuss changes in sediment accumulation and infer variations in discharge qualitatively (e.g., higher or lower discharge) but do not quantify recharge or discharge amounts with specific data.",No. None of the cited material explicitly indicates the creation of those specific types of water‐level maps. The hydrogeologic‐framework studies and aquifer analyses discussed do not appear to include published water‐table or piezometric‐surface maps.,"They were created primarily from measured water levels in wells (observation, test, municipal supply, and monitoring wells) throughout the Albuquerque Basin. Those point‐by‐point depth‐to‐water measurements (often supplemented by well‐log and geophysical data) were then contoured to produce the water table or potentiometric surface maps.","From the information provided, there is no indication that new water‐level measurements were collected as part of this study. Instead, it appears that any groundwater‐level data used were drawn from previous investigations or other compiled sources.","No. The text does not reference or provide any direct information about water quality testing or water chemistry data. The discussion focuses on geologic structure, stratigraphy, and basin-fill architecture rather than water quality.",They used both previously published age determinations and newly gathered data. The study incorporates 20 previously reported 40Ar/39Ar results and presents 58 new 40Ar/39Ar age determinations.,"From these references, the clearest indication of water‐quality–related data or analyses appears in the hydrogeology and hydrogeochemical modeling reports prepared or compiled by Hawley and colleagues (e.g., Hawley, 1996; Hawley & Whitworth, 1996; Hawley, Haase, & Lozinsky, 1995). Those reports, along with relevant New Mexico Bureau of Mines and Mineral Resources and New Mexico Water Resources Research Institute publications cited therein, are the principal sources for water quality data in this list.","No. The excerpt references groundwater importance and basin‐fill architecture for resource management but does not report specific hydrogeologic properties (e.g., porosity, permeability, or storage coefficients). No numerical values or direct measurements of those parameters are provided in the text.",Specific hydrogeologic properties (depth-porosity relationships and virgin specific storage) were reported by Haneberg (1995). They were determined from geophysical well logs and geotechnical analyses of the upper Santa Fe Group aquifer system in the central Albuquerque Basin.,"Based on the report’s emphasis on dating uncertainties, drainage evolution, and distinguishing climatic from tectonic controls, the following future work recommendations are suggested:

1) Improve Chronologic Controls.  
   • Refine existing age constraints (e.g., via higher-resolution magnetostratigraphy, tephrochronology, or additional radiometric dating).  
   • Collect more precise geochronological data to refine the timing of sediment aggradation vs. incision and better resolve the proposed lag in drainage integration.

2) Expand Basin‐Wide Correlations.  
   • Compare Plio‐Pleistocene sequences across adjacent basins (e.g., the San Pedro Valley, the southern Rio Grande rift) to separate localized tectonic signals from regional climatic effects.  
   • Evaluate the linkage between northern (Colorado) and central–southern (New Mexico) reaches of the Rio Grande to test how headwater integration influenced basin filling and incision.

3) Clarify Climate vs. Tectonic Influences.  
   • Undertake additional stable‐isotope and pedogenic studies to determine how sediment flux and incision events correlate with shifts in aridity and precipitation variability.  
   • Integrate sedimentologic data with paleoclimate modeling to identify the relative contribution of climate forcing versus diminished subsidence in controlling depositional system changes.

4) Map and Characterize Paleovalleys and Surfaces.  
   • Investigate possible early paleovalleys, especially where stratal relationships are obscured, to clarify how and when major paleodrainages developed.  
   • Use more detailed geomorphic and subsurface data (e.g., seismic or borehole data) to examine the extent and thickness of key surfaces like the Llano de Albuquerque surface.

5) Resolve the Timing and Mechanisms of Incision.  
   • Conduct targeted studies on inset terrace deposits to document the number, age, and correlation of incision events.  
   • Compare these terraces with known climatic cycles and tectonic episodes to determine the primary drivers of valley cutting.

By focusing on these approaches, future investigations can better refine the roles of subsidence, climate change, drainage expansion, and tectonic activity in shaping the Plio‐Pleistocene alluvial history of the Albuquerque Basin.",spe494-15.pdf
"Based on the material provided, the title of the study is “New perspectives on the geometry of the Albuquerque Basin.”","From the report sections, the focus is on the Santa Fe Group aquifer (the syn-rift Santa Fe Group “basin fill” that provides the major aquifer units in the study).","No. Although the authors used two‐dimensional cross‐sections as part of their analysis, the aquifer (Santa Fe Group) extent was ultimately defined with a three‐dimensional gravity model, not in purely 2D.","Yes. They identified the base of the aquifer as the base of the Santa Fe Group (rift fill). This was determined primarily from well data (direct picks of the basal contact in 29 oil-exploration wells) and further constrained by magnetotelluric, seismic-reflection, and gravity-inversion data.","Yes. They provide a set of digital grids (in Appendix H and the GSA Data Repository) from the final 3D geophysical model, which delineate the rift-fill (Santa Fe Group) thickness and structural base. These grids effectively define the aquifer’s extent in the study area.","It does not explicitly use the term “hydrostratigraphy,” but the study does map and characterize the aquifer’s stratigraphic units (particularly the Santa Fe Group) by integrating 3D gravity inversion, seismic-reflection surveys, and borehole data. These data collectively define the layered structure and thickness of the basin fill that constitutes the aquifer system.","Yes. They inferred structural controls on groundwater flow by constructing a three‑dimensional basin geometry—primarily from gravity inversion, well data that fully penetrated the basin fill, and seismic‑reflection constraints. These data were used to map the thickness of the rift fill and the elevation of the underlying bedrock, thereby delineating structural features that influence groundwater flow.","No. This section of the report does not discuss or define specific recharge and discharge zones. It focuses on the geometry of the basin fill (Santa Fe Group) based on gravity and seismic data, without delineating any areas of groundwater inflow (recharge) or outflow (discharge).",No. The sections provided focus on geophysical (gravity) modeling of basin-fill thickness and do not mention or present data quantifying recharge or discharge rates or amounts.,"No. The report sections do not indicate that the study produced water table or piezometric maps. They focus on modeling basin-fill thickness, gravity inversion, and structural elevations; there is no mention of creating or presenting water-level or potentiometric-surface maps.","From the report text provided, there is no explicit mention of how water‐level (e.g., water table elevation, depth to water, or piezometric surface) maps were constructed. The only relevant hint is that a variety of data from both exploration and water wells was used in analyses. Inferred from this, any water‐level maps would most likely derive from measured water levels (e.g., well logs) in those same wells. However, the text does not describe in detail the specific datasets or methods used to produce water‐level maps.","The provided text does not mention any water-level data, nor does it indicate whether such levels were newly collected or compiled from existing sources. Consequently, there is no explicit information about water-level collection or compilation in this section.","No. These sections discuss geologic, tectonic, and geophysical aspects of the basin but do not mention any water quality data.","From the discussion of integrating existing seismic‐reflection surveys, borehole logs, and other published geophysical and geologic information, it appears the study is primarily based on data compiled from multiple existing sources rather than newly collected data. They then applied specialized 3D gravity inversion techniques to these previously gathered datasets.","No specific water quality data sources are mentioned in this text. The well data described focus on geologic and geophysical parameters (such as depth and thickness of the Santa Fe Group) rather than water quality. Any references to water wells in the text concern structural or stratigraphic information, so water quality sources are not explicitly provided in this section.","No. The discussion centers on basin geometry, gravity modeling, and thickness constraints. While density variations are mentioned, specific hydrogeologic properties (porosity, permeability, storage coefficients, or hydraulic conductivity) are not explicitly reported in this text.",N/A,"Based on the discussion of the model’s development, its limitations, and how additional constraints improved results, the following future work is recommended:

• Collect additional data and refine constraints, especially in areas where gravity coverage is sparse (e.g., basin margins). This will help reduce local thickness uncertainties and improve the regional/residual gravity separation.  
• Acquire or reprocess seismic data to clarify velocity and density contrasts, particularly near deep or structurally complex zones of the basin. More robust seismic constraints will further refine the 3D models.  
• Incorporate newly drilled well data or reanalyze existing wells that only partially reach the base of the Santa Fe Group. Such information will help tighten minimum thickness estimates and validate the model in critical areas.  
• Examine possible lateral density variations within the Santa Fe Group and associated volcanic intervals. Accounting for heterogeneity in these units could yield more accurate layer-based gravity models.  
• Continue to integrate 2D and 3D geophysical modeling with geological cross sections. Ongoing validation efforts—comparing model outputs to independent seismic and well data—will guide iterative improvements to subsurface interpretations.  ",spe494-16.pdf
