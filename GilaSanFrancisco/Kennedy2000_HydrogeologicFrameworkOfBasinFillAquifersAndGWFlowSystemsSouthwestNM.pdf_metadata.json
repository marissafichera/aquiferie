Annual NMGS Fall Field Conference Guidebooks Every fall since 1950, the New Mexico Geological Society (NMGS) has held an annual Fall Field Conference that explores some region of New Mexico (or surrounding states). Always well attended, these conferences provide a guidebook to participants. Besides detailed road logs, the guidebooks contain many well written, edited, and peer-reviewed geoscience papers. These books have set the national standard for geologic guidebooks and are an essential geologic reference for anyone working in or around New Mexico. Free Downloads NMGS has decided to make peer-reviewed papers from our Fall Field Conference guidebooks available for free download. This is in keeping with our mission of promoting interest, research, and cooperation regarding geology in New Mexico. However, guidebook sales represent a significant proportion of our operating budget. Therefore, only research papers are available for download. Road logs, mini-papers, and other selected content are available only in print for recent guidebooks.

Box 3001, Las Cruces, NM 88003-3l67;jkennedy@nmsu.edu; 2New Mexico Bureau of Mines and Mineral Resources, New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology, 2808 Central Ave SE, 87106; rcasc@admin.nmt.edu; 3Montana State University, Bozeman, Montana 59717 Abstract-Ongoing cooperation between the governments of the United States and the Republic of Mexico, particularly projects involving the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, requires that major aquifer systems with transboundary components be adequately characterized in terms of their bydrogeologic framework, ground- water-flow regimes and water-quality conditions. As part of this program, the New Mexico Water Resources Research Institute and cooperating institutions have developed Geographic Information System (GIS) coverages (ARC/TNFO\u00ae format) that integrate large amounts of available surface and subsurface information on basin-fill aquifers in the International Boundary region between Trans-Pecos Texas and southeastern Arizona. Emphasis of this overview is on major GIS elements relating to aquifer composition and general ground-water-flow regimes in four intermontane basin systems of southwestern New Mexico and northwestern Chihuahua: Mimbres, Hachita-Moscos, Playas, and Animas. The ARC/INFO\u00ae format allows 3-D presentation of hydroge- ological information and related interpretations that can be used in numerical ground-water-flow models. The hydrogeologic framework and hydraulic properties of basin and valley fills are categorized on the basis of(l) hydrostratigraphic unit (HSU) and lithofacies assemblage (LFA) composition and (2) the nature of basin-bound- ary and intra-basin bedrock and structural controls. Major aquifers are formed by medium- coarse-grained flu- vial-facies assemblages deposited by the ancestral Mimbres and Animas fluvial systems. These poorly consoli- dated HS Us and LFAs are informal subdivisions of the (Pliocene-Quaternary) upper Gila Group and overly- ing basin-floor deposits. Typical horizontal hydraulic conductivities range from I to IO m/day, and unit thick- nesses are as much as 150 m. Laterally equivalent piedmont-slope facies and underlying middle and lower Gila Group HS Us have much lower aquifer potential because of finer matrix texture and greater degree of consoli- dation and cementation. Whereas all of the basin systems in the study area have surface-flow components that discharge to subbasins with topographic closure and ephemeral lakes (playas), the ground-water-flow regime in most subbasins bas an underflow-discharge component that drains to terminal sinks in lower contiguous basins or river-valley areas. Historically, transboundary ground-water flow from the United States to Mexico has been documented in a few areas, but at a very low rate (<I0.5 x 106 ml/yr). INTRODUCTION The New Mexico Water Resources Research Institute (NMWRRI) and cooperating organizations recently completed an intensive review of available infonnation on Trans-International Boundary Aquifers in southwestern New Mexico for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA). This 2-yr project involved compilation, analysis, and synthesis of geographic, hydrogeologic, geohydrologic, and hydrogeo- chemical infonnation in a large region (Fig. I) extending from the upper Gila River basin on the north to the lower Rio Casas Grandes basin in northern Chihuahua, and westward from the eastern edge of Mimbres River basin to the San Bernardino basin of southeastern Arizona and northeastern Sonora (Hawley et al., 2000). The study was a continuation of joint efforts by the governments of the United States and Mexico to identify all major transboundary aquifers, to better characterize ground- water flow and quality conditions, and to develop adequate Geographic lnfonnation System (GIS) coverages (Hibbs et al., 1998a, b). Highlights of these recent NMWRRI-USEPA investigations in areas visited during the 51st New Mexico Geological Society Field Conference are briefly covered here and in a companion paper by Hibbs et al. (this volume). Emphasis in this paper is on GIS development with respect to(!) the hydrogeologic framework of basin-fill aquifers and (2) ground-water flow regimes in the four major basin systems: Mimbres, Hachita- Moscos, Playas, and Animas. Ground water in these systems discharges to closed-topographic depressions and stream valleys in the southwest- ern New Mexico region west of the Rio Grande rift (Fig. I). The com- panion paper in the guidebook by Hibbs et al. reviews ground-water quality and hydrogeologic interrelationships in the Animas basin sys- tem. The hydrogeology of basin-fill aquifers in most of the region has never been investigated at more than a reconnaissance level (e.g., Trauger and Doty, 1965; Wilkins, 1986, 1998). Hydrogeologic-frame- work and ground-water-flow characteristics of major aquifer systems are only well documented in widely spaced areas of irrigation agricul- ture and near the few centers of urban population and mineral-process- ing activity (Reeder, 1957; Doty, 1960; Trauger, 1972; Hawkins and Stephens, 1983; O'Brien and Stone, 1983, 1984; Hanson et al. 1994). Preliminary numerical models of ground-water flow in the basin-fill aquifer system have been developed for the Mimbres basin (system) and the Lower Animas subbasin (Hanson et al., 1994; Hawkins, 1981; O'Brien and Stone, 1983). These models are two dimensional, howev- er, and they are poorly suited for accurate characterization of the well- documented vertical changes in aquifer conditions such as head distri- bution and decreasing permeability with depth"

Preliminary numerical models of ground-water flow in the basin-fill aquifer system have been developed for the Mimbres basin (system) and the Lower Animas subbasin (Hanson et al., 1994; Hawkins, 1981; O'Brien and Stone, 1983). These models are two dimensional, howev- er, and they are poorly suited for accurate characterization of the well- documented vertical changes in aquifer conditions such as head distri- bution and decreasing permeability with depth (Kernodle, 1992a). The provisional three-dimensional hydrogeologic models of basin-fill aquifers developed as part of this NMWRRI-USEPA study (ARC/INFO\u00ae GIS format) are an initial step toward creation ofnumer- ical models that more accurately portray the essential elements of the ground-water-flow system (Hawley et al., 2000). Physiographic setting Most of the study area (Fig. I) is in the Mexican Highland section of the Basin-and-Range physiographic province (Hawley, 1986). Three basin systems: Mimbres, Hachita-Moscos, and Playas, are east of the Continental Divide, and the Animas-Cloverdale system is to the west. Elevations range from 2600 m at Animas Peak to less than 1200 m at the lower end of the Mimbres basin system. The northern and highest part of the study area is in the Datil-Mogollon section of the Transition Zone province (Fig. I). As the province name implies, large-scale geo- morphic and structural features mark a broad zone of transition between the Colorado Plateau of west-central New Mexico and east-central Arizona, and the Basin-and-Range province (Hawley, 1986; Morrison, 199 l ). The latter region has an extended crustal structure characterized by broad and deep fault-block depressions. Elevations of the highest peaks in the Datil-Mogollon section exceed 3000 m and much of this area of high plateaus with deep canyons is above 1800 m. The section includes most of the perennial to intermittent reaches of the upper Mimbres River system and its high-mountain tributaries in the Black and Piiios Altos ranges adjacent to the Continental Divide. 236 Index Basin System I Mimbres basin 2 Hachita-Moscos basin 3 Playas basin 4 Animas basin 5 Gila River basin 6 San Bernardino basin 7 San Basilio basin 8 Rio Casas Grandes basin Figure la.

Location of the study area in southwestern New Mexico. The locations of the following basin systems are shown on Figure la: (1) Mimbres, (2) Hachita- Moscos, (3) Playas, (4) Animas, (5) Gila River, (6) San Bernardino, (7) San Basilio, and (8) Rio Cases Grandes. Each basin system is comprised of numerous sub- basin units (Fig. I b ). The following pluvial lakes are listed on Figure le: Animas (LA), Cloverdale (LCI), Hachita (LH), Palomas (LPa), and Playas (LP\\). The more-permeable fill components of the deep structural basins that form about 75% of the Mexican Highland section comprise the major aquifers described in this paper. There are two classes of intermontane basins: {I) topographically closed basins with piedmont and basin-floor alluvial surfaces grading to central playa (ephemeral-lake) depressions are designated bolsons, and (2) open basins with piedmont slopes grad- ing to axial streams that discharge to lower-lying areas are referred to as semibolsons (Hill 1900; Tolman, 1909; Hawley, 1969). In this paper, the terms open and closed refer solely to surface-flow regimes. All stream systems are ephemeral except in the upper valley of the Mimbres River and Animas Creek, and in short canyon reaches in the highest parts of the Animas, Peloncillo-Guadalupe, and Big Burro ranges (Fig. I). Land use, landcover, and climate The study area includes a wide variety of land-use/landcover cate- gories, with conifer forests present at the highest elevations and grass- land to desert scrub prevalent in drier, lower-elevation areas (Hawley et al., 2000). Lowlands contain a mix of irrigated farmland, rangeland and alkali-flats. The major urban areas include Deming, Lordsburg, Silver City, and Hurley, with a number of smaller rural communities scattered throughout the area. The Silver City-Hurley area has been one of the largest metallic-mineral producing centers of the region for more than a century. Climatic conditions are typical of the arid to semiarid Southwest, with mostly clear skies and limited rainfall and humidity (Hawley et al., 2000). Average annual precipitation varies from less than 25.4 cm per yr in low-lying basins to as much as 76.2 cm per yr at higher elevations in the mountains. Annual rainfall at Deming (elevation 1321 m) aver- aged 23.4 cm between 1948 and 1995. In the upper reaches of the Mimbres River (elevation 1904 m), the average was 43.3 cm for the same period. Nearly half of the annual precipitation is from convective thunderstorms that occur sporadically from July to October. In the lower elevation areas, the average high summer (June, July, and August) tem- peratures typically are above 32\u00b0C. Winter (December, January, and February) average low temperatures are usually about -4\u00b0C. At higher elevation areas, average high summer temperatures are about 29\u00b0C and winter low temperatures are about -7\u00b0C. Large diurnal changes in tem- perature of about l 7\u00b0C are common. Average class A pan evaporation typically is about 250-260 cm on basin floors. BASIC CONCEPTS OF BASIN HYDROGEOLOGY Introduction In both the Mexican Highland and Datil-Mogollon sections, ground water primarily occurs in the poorly consolidated sediments that have accumulated in structural basins between mountain ranges. These inter- montane basins (bolsons, semibolsons) are commonly referred to as \"alluvial basins\" (Wilkins, 1986, 1998; Kernodle, 1992a). Their fills are not entirely of alluvial origin (i.e., stream deposits), because they include lesser amounts of lacustrine, eolian, and colluvial sediments"

BASIC CONCEPTS OF BASIN HYDROGEOLOGY Introduction In both the Mexican Highland and Datil-Mogollon sections, ground water primarily occurs in the poorly consolidated sediments that have accumulated in structural basins between mountain ranges. These inter- montane basins (bolsons, semibolsons) are commonly referred to as \"alluvial basins\" (Wilkins, 1986, 1998; Kernodle, 1992a). Their fills are not entirely of alluvial origin (i.e., stream deposits), because they include lesser amounts of lacustrine, eolian, and colluvial sediments (Gile et al., 1981; Seager et al., 1982, 1987; Drewes et al., I 985; Seager, 1995; Mack et al., 1997; Hawley et al., 2000). Fractured volcanic rocks (basalts, andesites, and tuft's), which immediately underlie or are inter- layered with the basin fill, also form productive aquifers in some places (Trauger, 1972; Blandford and Wilson, 1987); but the occurrence of ground water in most consolidated rocks of the region is limited to water-filled fracture zones of typically very low yield. Such zones occur in a wide variety of fractured bedrock units including sedimentary, vol- canic, intrusive-igneous, and metamorphic types. Bedrock uplands are the ultimate source areas for the basin fill and bedrock terranes usually form effective boundaries for basin-fill aquifer systems. Unlike some parts of the Basin-and-Range province (e.g., southern Nevada and Trans-Pecos Texas), there are no extensive bodies of carbonate rock that provide conduits for interbasin ground-water flow (Maxey, 1968; Hibbs et al., 1998a). Both interbasin and intrabasin boundary structures, such as faults and flexures, are also part of a group of tectonic and volcanic features that play a major role in ground-water-flow dynamics. Each of the four basin systems described in this paper is characterized 237 by one or more distinct ground-water-flow regimes, and only two (Mimbres and Hachita-Moscos) have significant transboundary aquifer components that extend into Mexico (Fig. I). The Gila river basin, which heads in the high plateaus of the Mogollon-Datil volcanic field, is at the northern edge of the study area. The basin includes a series of deep canyons and valleys that are cut well below most of the aquifers of the intermontane basins to the south. The Duncan-Virden segment of the Gila river valley acts as the regional sink for nearly all pre-development (pre-1900) ground water flow in the northern Animas basin system. Regional ground water sinks for the southern Mimbres and Hachita- Moscos basin systems (Fig. I) are formed by the Bo Ison de los Muertos and Rio Casas Grandes valley (Reeves, 1969; Hawley, 1969, 1975, 1993; Hanson et al., 1994). Conceptual model of ground-water flow in basin-fill aquifers The conceptual model of surface-water and ground-water flow in the intermontane-basin aquifer systems of the study area (Fig. 2) is based on previous work in the Basin-and-Range province (Maxey, 1968; Eakin et al., 1976; Mifflin, 1988; Hibbs et al., 1998a). As already noted, the tenns ~ and open refer only to the surface flow into, through, and from intermontane basins, whereas the terms undrained, partly drained, and drained designate classes of ground-water flow involving intrabasin and/or interbasin movement. Phreatic and vadose indicate saturated and unsaturated subsurface conditions, respectively. Phrea(ic p/ayas (with springs and seeps) are restricted to floors of~ basins (bolsons) that are undrained or partly drained, and vadose playas occur in both closed and QJl.fll, ~ basins. In the transboundary study region, as well as in most other desert basins of western North America, the intermediate basin class referred to as partly drained is probably the major ground- water-flow regime. Few intermontane basins (ho/sons and semibo/sons) are truly undrained in terms of ground-water discharge, whether or not they are~ or open in terms of surface flow. Under pre-development conditions, ground-water discharge in the region occurred mainly through subsurface leakage from one basin sys- tem into another, discharge into the gaining reaches of perennial or intermittent streams, discharge from springs, or by evapotranspiration from phreatic playas and cienegas (valley-floor wetlands). Most recharge to basin-fill aquifers occurs by two mechanisms: (1) \"mountain front,\" where some precipitation falling on bedrock highlands con- tributes to the ground-water reservoir along basin margins; and (2) \"trib- utary,\" where the reservoir is replenished along losing reaches of larger intra-basin streams (Anderholm, I 994; Hanson et al., 1994; Kernodle, 1992a; Wasiolek, 1995).

Secondary contributors to these ground-water reservoirs are the few high and massive mountain ranges that form iso- lated highlands within individual basin systems. Recharge estimates in this report are based on the assumptions that (I) only I to 2% of aver- age annual precipitation contributes to recharge, and (2) this contribu- tion is distributed very unevenly over higher watersheds and in major stream valleys. Conceptual hydrogeologic-framework model The hydrogeologic framework of basin-fill aquifers in the study area (Hawley et al., 2000), with special emphasis on features related to envi- ronmental concerns, is described here in terms of three basic conceptu- al building blocks: Hydrostratigraphic units (HSUs), lithofacies assem- blages (LFAs), and structural-boundary conditions. A conceptual hydrogeologic model of an interconnected shallow valley-fill/basin-fill and deep-basin aquifer system was initially developed for use in ground-water-flow models of the Mesilla and Albuquerque basins (Peterson et al., 1984; Kernodle, 1992a; Hawley and Lozinsky, 1992; Frenzel and Kaehler, 1992; Hawley and Haase, 1992; Thom et al., 1993; Hawley et al. 1995; Kernodle et al. 1995); however, basic design of the"

A conceptual hydrogeologic model of an interconnected shallow valley-fill/basin-fill and deep-basin aquifer system was initially developed for use in ground-water-flow models of the Mesilla and Albuquerque basins (Peterson et al., 1984; Kernodle, 1992a; Hawley and Lozinsky, 1992; Frenzel and Kaehler, 1992; Hawley and Haase, 1992; Thom et al., 1993; Hawley et al. 1995; Kernodle et al. 1995); however, basic design of the conceptual model is flexible enough to allow it to be modified for use in other basins of the Rio Grande rift and adjacent parts of the southeast- ern Basin-and-Range province. This model is simply a qualitative description (graphical, numerical, and verbal) of how a given geohy- drologic system is influenced by (I) bedrock-boundary conditions, (2) internal-basin structure, and (3) the lithofacies and mineralogical com- position of various basin-fill stratigraphic units. It provides a mecha- nism for systematically organizing a large amount of relevant hydroge- ologic i.nformation of widely varying quality and scale (from very gen- eral drillers' observations to detailed bore-hole, geophysical and geo- chemical data). Model elements can be graphically displayed in a com- bined map and cross-section GIS format so that basic information and inferences on geohydrologic attributes (e.g., hydraulic conductivity, transmissivity, anisotropy, and general spatial-distribution patterns) may be transferred to basin-scale, three-dimensional numerical models of groundilwater-flow systems. As emphasized by McCord and Stephens (1999)1 this scale of data presentation and interpretation is not designed for sitei-specific ground-water investigations. Hydrostratigraphic units Most basin fill in southwestern New Mexico has been subdivided into two major lithostratigraphic units, the Santa Fe Group in Rio Grande rift basins (e.g., Seager et al, 1982, 1987) and the Gila Group [Gila con- glomerate of Gilbert, 1875) in basins of the Mexican Highland and Datil-Mogollon sections to the west (e.g. Trauger, 1972; Drewes et al., 1985). rn addition, a clear distinction has rarely been made between deposits simply classed as \"bolson\" or \"basin\" fill and contiguous (for- mal and informal) subdivisions of the Gila Groups (e.g., Hanson et al, 1994; Seager, 1995; and Clemons, 1998). As a first step in organizing available information on basin-fill stratigraphy that has a close relation- ship with aquifer characteristics, a provisional hydrostratigraphic classi- fication system has been developed following guidelines used success- fully in Albuquerque and Mesilla basins of the Rio Grande rift (Hawley et al., 1995). Hydrostratigraphic units defined in this study area by Hawley et al. (2000) are mappable bodies of basin fill and valley fill that are grouped on the basis of origin and position in both lithostratigraphic and chronostratigraphic sequences. The informal IJJ1/l\u00a3, llliJJJlk., and lm\u00a3Ja. !iilf1. and Santa Fe hydrostratigraphic units (HSUs) comprise the major basin-fill aquifer zones, and they correspond roughly to the (formal and informal) upper, middle and lower lithostratigraphic subdivisions of the Gila and Santa Fe groups used in local and regional geologic mapping (Table I, Fig. 3). Santa Fe units are mapped only along the eastern edge of the Mimbres basin system in an area that is transitional to the Rio Grande rift structural province. The other major hydrostratigraphic units KENNEDY et al. comprise channel and floodplain deposits of the Mimbres River and Animas Creek in the United States, and the Casas Grandes fluvial sys- tem in Mexico. These valley fills of Late Quaternary age (<130 ka) form the upper part of the region's most productive shallow-aquifer system. Surficial lake and playa deposits, fills of larger arroyo valleys, and pied- mont-slope alluvium are primarily in the ~ zone. However, they locally form important ground-water discharge and recharge sites. Historical /2h.J:J:JJ.1k. conditions exist, or have recently existed, in a few playa remnants of large pluvial lakes of Late Quaternary age. Notable examples are \"alkali flats\" in the lower Animas, Playas, Hachita (Laguna Los Moscos), Mimbres, Bolson de las Muertos, and Casas Grandes (Laguna Guzman) basins (Fig. I). The lower reaches of the Animas, Mimbres and Casas Grandes systems include extensive fluvial- fan and fan-delta deposits (Fleischhauer and Stone, 1982; Love and Seager, J 996; Mack et al. 1997).

These sedimentary facies classes are defined primari- ly on the basis of grain-size distribution, mineralogy, sedimentary struc- tures, and degree of post-depositional alteration; they are grouped according to inferred environments of deposition. LFAs have distinctive geophysical, geochemical, and hydrologic attributes, and they provide a mechanism for showing distribution patterns of major aquifers and con- fining units in hydrogeologic cross-sections. In this study, basin and val- ley fills are subdivided into 13 major assemblages that are ranked in decreasing order of aquifer potential (Tables 2 to 4; LFAs 1- 10, lb;). Figure 4 is a schematic illustration of the distribution pattern LFAs observed in the Rio Grande rift and southwestern New Mexico Basin- and-Range region. Table I lists inferred interrelationships between major HSUs and LFAs. Lithofacies properties that influence ground- water flow and production potential in this region are summarized in Tables 3 and 4. Note that &unfm l11J.!11ffilll. notation (1- X) originally used in previous hydrogeologic framework models (Hawley et al., 1995) has been changed to Arabic style in order to facilitate the development of alpha-numeric attribute codes that can be used in both conceptual and numerical models of basin-fill aquifer systems. Bedrock and structural boundary components Structural and bedrock features that influence aquifer composition and behavior include basin-boundary mountain uplifts, bedrock units beneath the basin-fill, fault zones and flexures within and at the edges of basins, and igneous intrusive and extrusive rocks that penetrate or are interbedded with basin fill. Tectonic evolution of the fault-block basins, many with a half-graben structure and accommodation-zone termina- tions, and ranges of the study area has had a profound effect on the dis- tribution of lithofacies assemblages and the timing and style of emplace- ment of all major hydrostratigraphic units (Figs. 3, 4). Discussion of this topic is beyond the scope of this paper, and the reader is referred to par- ticularly pertinent reviews by Seager and Morgan ( 1979), Mack and Seager (1990), Smith (1994), Mack et al. (1997), Faulds and Varga (1998), and Hawley et al. (2000). \u2022 Hydraulic properties of major hydrogeologic units The most productive part of the basin-fill aquifer system is formed by (I) unconsolidated to partly indurated deposits of the HJlJlll. and middle !iiiJJ, HSUs, and (2) overlying basin and valley fills deposited by the Animas, Mimbres, and Gila fluvial systems (Hawley et al., 2000). The total saturated thickness of these units rarely exceeds 150 m. Limiting assumptions used in this study for preliminary estimates of available water stored in the basin-fill aquifer systems include: (1) aquifer is unconfined, (2) estimated average thickness is JOO m, (3) specific yield is 0.1, and (4) water is potable quality (<1,000 mg/L TDS). Irrigation- well specific-capacity data and a few pumping tests from the Animas, Playas, and Mimbres basin systems provide the basis for many of the published interpretations of aquifer performance and hydraulic proper- ties (Reeder, 1957; Doty, 1960; Trauger, 1972; Hanson et al., 1994; Wilkins, 1998). Maximum discharge ranges for most irrigation wells are from I 090 to 5450 m3/d (cubic meters per day). Calculated aquifer transmissivities are as high as 4650 m2/d (square meters per day) at a few localities, but most values are in the 200-2000 m2/d range. Typical ranges in horizon- tal conductivity for the upper, more productive parts of the aquifer sys- tem are from 1 to 10 mid. Specific yield estimates vary from 0.1 to 0.2, assuming unconfined aquifer conditions. Because semiconfioed to con- fined conditions prevail in many parts of the aquifer system, estimates of ground-water availability (as well as assessment of aquifer-deforma- tion and land-subsidence potential) may require much smaller storage coefficient values (Kernodle, 1992a, b; Haneberg and Friesen, 1995). Highest average specific capacities (232-304 m3/dfm) are reported for wells completed mainly in the coarse-grained fluvial facies (LFAs l and 2.) ofuJ!JJer Gila HSUs and overlying deposits of the ancestral Mimbres and Animas fluvial systems (e.g., HSUs, RMF, and RAF; LFAs al and g]_).

Horizontal hydraulic conductivities in conglomeratic sandstones and mudstones of the 10.Jer Gila HSU ( LFAs Z, B) rarely exceed 0.3 mid. The available published information for these units indicate that vertical hydraulic conductivities are significant, on the order of several hundred to sever- al thourand times, less than horizontal conductivities (Kernodle, 1992a).

The estimated upper limit of annual transbound- ary ground-water movement through these basin-fill aquifer systems during the past century is about 10.5 x 106 m3. The hydrogeologic framework and ground-water-flow regimes in these basin systems (Hawley et al., 2000) are briefly sumIDarized below.

Dwyer, San Vicente, Deming, Hermanas, and Florida subbasins form the major structural lows; the Cookes Range, Florida uplift, and Tres Hermanas Mountains are the largest intra-basin ranges (Darton, 1916; Trauger, 1972; Seager et al., 1982, Drewes et al., 1985; Hanson et al., 1994; Seager, 1995; Clemons, 1998). The Mimbres basin complex cov- ers about 11,300 km2 of New Mexico and about 2,000 km2 of Chihuahua (Hawley et al., 2000). Low, volcanic upland areas separate most of the basin system from the Palomas and Mesilla basins of the Rio Grande rift structural province to the east. Much of the system's west- ern and northern boundary is along the Continental Divide, and includes the crests of Sierra Alta, the Cedar Mountain Range, and the southern Burro uplift (Fig. 1). The Upper Mimbres subbasin is located in the southeastern Datil-Mogollon section and includes the only perennial reach of the Mimbres River. About 85% of the basin system is in the Mexican Highland section and includes the only major transboundary aquifer unit in the study area (Hawley et al., 2000). Older channel and fluvial-fan deposits of the ancestral Mimbres River extend to the Mexican border in the Deming and Florida subbasins. These deposits cover much of the basin-floor area between Deming and the Columbus- Palomas border community and they constitute the largest alluvial aquifer in the study area (Darton, 1916; Seager, 1995; Love and Seager, 1996; Mack et al., 1997). Maximum fill thicknesses in the deepest structural subbasins (San Vicente, Deming, Hermanas, and Florida) are in the 600-1525-m range (Birch, I 980; Heywood, 1992, unpublished; Klein, 1995; Seager, I 995; Clemons, 1998)). As emphasized throughout this paper, productive aquifer zones are usually restricted to the upper 300 m of the basin-fill sequence ( HSUs: UG2/MG; LFAs 1-3, a). Intervening structural highs form not only \"insular\" (Cookes, Florida, Tres Hermanas) mountain ranges and hilly uplands, but also buried bedrock highs or \"sills.\" These ------------ BASJN FILL--- --------- FIGURE 4.

This estimate may be much too high, because at many localities most of the upper 100 m of the basin-fill aquifer is fine grained, and semiconfined to confined conditions prevail (Hanson et al., 1994; Haneberg and Friesen, 1995). In addition, much of the water stored in thicker aquifer zones may be very old (thousands to tens of thousands of years) and of poor quality, and it is not effectively recharged under Holocene climatic conditions. Published estimates sug- gest that 1-2% of average annual precipitation, primarily concentrated in high mountain areas in the northern part of the basin system, con- tributes to ground-water recharge (Hanson et al., 1994). Total annual recharge could be as high as about 74 x I 06 m3, with the mountain-front component estimated at about 66 x I 06 m3. Ground water in the Mimbres basin system generally moves from the northern highlands adjacent to the Continental Divide to the interior (San Vicente, Deming and Florida) subbasins flanking the Cookes Range and Florida Mountains (Fig. I). It then flows southward toward the Hermanas-Columbus (Palomas)-West Portillo segment of the International Boundary zone (Blandford and Wilson, 1987). Estimated predevelopment (pre-1900) flow into Mexico was about 8 x I 06 m3 annually (Hanson et al., 1994). Much of this flow has been intercepted by irrigation wells in the Deming, Hermanas, and Colurnbus-Palomas areas during the past century. The regional sink for ground water cross- ing the New Mexico-Chihuahua border is the complex of vadose and phreatic p/ayas on the floor of Bolson de los Muertos at the south end of the Columbus and Florida subbasins of the Mimbres system (Hawley et al., 2000). This area has an elevation of about 1175 m and includes the eastern basin of pluvial Lake Palomas (Reeves, 1969). The lake had a maxiyium highstand area of about 7770 km2 recorded by relict shore- line features at an elevation of about 1225 m (Hawley 1969, 1993). Hachita-Moscos basin system The~ and partly drained Hachita-Moscos basin system includes a small, but important trans-boundary aquifer component. The system has an area of about 2700 km2, with about 1100 km2 in Chihuahua (Fig. I). The system includes three half-graben complexes that are designat- ed the Upper Hachita, Wamel-Moscos and Lower Hachita subbasins by Hawley et al. (2000). Early reconnaissance ofhydrogeologic conditions was done by Schwennesen (1918) and Trauger and Herrick ( I 962). Bordering mountain ranges effectively separate the Hacbita-Moscos system from the Mimbres and Playas basin systems except at Hatchet Gap between the Big and Little Hatchet ranges (Fig. 1). In this area there is a small amount of surface and subsurface inflow from the Upper Playas subbasin to the southwest. Ephemeral axial streams (Hachita and Wamel's Draws) carry surface runoff from highland areas and converge in a large dslli!Jl. depression in Chihuahua that is occupied by the ephemeral-lake plain of Laguna los Moscos. During Late Quaternary pluvial stages, this depression was episodically flooded by Lake Hachita (Schwennesen, 1918). Maximum lake surface area was about 150 km2 based on highest relict-shoreline elevations at 1262 m (Hawley, 1993). Geophysical surveys (Birch, 1980; Klein, 1995; Heywood, 1992) indicate that maximum fill thicknesses in the subbasins range from about 600 to 1525 m. The primary aquifer system comprises basin-floor and piedmont-slope deposits of the YJ!.llll and middle Gila HSUs (UG 1,2 and MG) that are unconsolidated to partly indurated. These units are no more than 200 m thick, and LFAs 1- 5 are the major aquifer components. Available ground water of potable quality in storage is probably significantly less than the maximum volume of 6 x I 09 m3 estimated by Hawley et al. (2000). Their estimated annual recharge to Hachita-Moscos basin fill aquifers is about 6 x I 06 m3. This amount includes a small annual underflow component (less than 10,000 m3 that \"spills\" from the Upper Playas subbasin into the Upper Hachita sub- basin through Hatchet Gap (Schwennesen, 1918; Hawley et al., 2000). Ground-water flow generally mimics surface topography and moves eastward along basin axial trends toward Laguna los Moscos. Early geo- KENNEDY et al. hydrologic observations indicate that this playa has both ~ and vadose flow components (Schwennesen, 1918; Trauger and Herrick, 1962). More recent work also suggests that there is a partial underflow (drainage) connection between Laguna Los Moscos and the Lower Valley of Rio Casas Grandes, which is located only IO km to the east across a very low topographic divide (Hawley et al., 2000). A prelimi- nary estimate of potential annual ground-water flow across the com- bined Hachita and Wamel-Moscos International Boundary segments is no more than 2.5 x 1Q6 m3. Piayas basin system The partly closed partly drained Playas basin system (Fig. 1) has an area of about 2400 km2 (Schwennesen, 1918; Doty, 1960). It is bordered on the south by a \"no-flow\" drainage divide with the San Basilio basin of northwestern Chihuahua (Hawley et al., 2000). The Continental Divide, which follows the crest of the Animas Mountains, forms the western and northern boundary of the Playas basin system. Its eastern border with the Hachita-Moscos system follows the crest of the Dog, Alamo Hueco, and Big and Little Hatchet uplifts. The Upper (southern) Playas subbasin is an open and drained geohydrologic unit that prima- rily discharges northward to the closed and partly drained Lower Playas subbasin, but as already noted, a small amount of flood runoff and ground-water underflow \"spills\" through Hatchet"

It is bordered on the south by a \"no-flow\" drainage divide with the San Basilio basin of northwestern Chihuahua (Hawley et al., 2000). The Continental Divide, which follows the crest of the Animas Mountains, forms the western and northern boundary of the Playas basin system. Its eastern border with the Hachita-Moscos system follows the crest of the Dog, Alamo Hueco, and Big and Little Hatchet uplifts. The Upper (southern) Playas subbasin is an open and drained geohydrologic unit that prima- rily discharges northward to the closed and partly drained Lower Playas subbasin, but as already noted, a small amount of flood runoff and ground-water underflow \"spills\" through Hatchet Gap into the Upper Hachita subbasin. The Lower Playas subbasin includes a large ephemer- al-lake plain (phreatic-vadose playa complex) now periodically flooded by Playas Lake. During the Late Quaternary this depression was episod- ically flooded by pluvial Lake Playas (Schwennesen, 1918; Van Devender and Worthington, 1978), which had a maximum surface area of about 65 km2 based on the elevation of the highest shoreline features at about 1311 m (Hawley, 1993). Maximum basin-fill thickness is estimated to be at least 600 m (Birch, 1980; Klein, 1995), but the primary aquifer system comprises basin- floor and piedmont-slope deposits of the UUJJer and middle Gila HSUs (UG2, UGI, and MG). These units are unconsolidated to partly indurat- ed (mainly LFAs 1=i) and no more than 300 m thick. A very optimistic estimate of available potable ground water stored in the unconfined part of the saturated zone is no more than 6 x I 09 m3, and estimated annual recharge to the Playas basin aquifer system is about 7 x 106 m3. The major recharge sources in both the Playas and Animas-Cloverdale sys- tems are the high Sierra San Luis and Animas mountain ranges that bor- der the Upper Playas subbasin on the west (Hawley et al., 2000). A provisional estimate (Hawley et al., 2000) of annual northward flow from the Upper to Lower Playas subbasins in the upper and middle Gila basin-fill aquifer system is about 5.48 x I 06 m3. Most of this flow was discharged by evaporation and transpiration in the southern Playas Lake depression in predevelopment time (pre-1945). However, previous investigations suggest that a very small amount of underflow also could have \"leaked\" from the Lower Playas area into aquifers of the northern Animas Basin system via conduits beneath the Continental Divide northwest and north(?) of Playas Lake (Fig. I; Schwennesen, I 9 I 8; Reeder, 1957; Doty, 1960). Animas basin system The Animas basin system (Fig. I) is an interconnected group of four structural and geohydrologic subbasins with a watershed area of about 6340 km2 (Schwennesen, 1918; Reeder, 1957; Hawley et al., 2000). The Continental Divide, including the crests of the San Luis and Animas ranges, forms the entire eastern boundary of the system. Its western bor- der with the San Bernardino and San Simon basins (mainly in Arizona) is formed by the Peloncillo-Guadalupe range. The ~and partly drained Cloverdale (or San Luis) subbasin, at the south end of the Animas basin system, extends into Mexico and straddles the intersec- tion of the borders of New Mexico, Chihuahua, and Sonora (Krider, 1998; Vincent and Krider, 1998). This subbasin, with a total area of 480 km2, has a small transboundary aquifer component (<100 km2). It includes a large phreatic-vadose playa complex, as well as a \"perched- aquifer\" zone in a shallow~ depression. The latter area was episod- ically flooded by pluvial Lake Cloverdale during both the Wisconsin HYDROGEOLOGIC FRAMEWORK Glacial Stage and wetter intervals of the Holocene (Schwennesen, 1918; Krider, 1998). The maximum lake area was about I 04 krn2 based on the elevation of highest shoreline features at about 1577 m (Hawley, 1993). The only perennial to intermittent streams in the Animas basin system are in the southern part of the open and drained Upper Animas subbasin, which is separated from the Cloverdale subbasin by a low topographic divide (Krider, 1998). This fluvial system occupies the valley of Animas Creek and its major headwater tributaries (Schwennesen, 1918; Reeder, 1957; Vincent and Krider, 1998). The Upper Animas subbasin opens northward into the r.;jIJHd. and drained Lower Animas subbasin, which includes the important Animas-Cotton City area of irrigation agriculture west of the central Mimbres basin system. Dominant surficial units are widespread fluvial-deltaic deposits of ancestral Animas Creek and an extensive middle- late Pleistocene basalt flow west of Animas (Schwennesen, I 918; Reeder, 1957; Fleischhauer and Stone, 1982; O'Brien and Stone, 1983, 1984; Drewes el al., 1985; Machette et al., 1986). The northern part of the Lower Animas subbasin includes exten- sive dune fields and a large ephemeral-lake plain with alkali flats that forms a vadose pk{ya complex. During late Quaternary pluvial intervals, the basin floor area below elevations ranging from 1270 to 1279 m was episodically flooded by Lake Animas (Schwennesen, 1918). At its deep- est (latest Pleistocene) stage the lake had a surface area of about 390 krn2 (Fleischhauer and Stone, 1982; Hawley, 1993). The__QJW! and drained Lordsburg subbasin, which heads in the Burro Mountain-Continental Divide area (Fig. I) joins the Lower Animas sub- basin at the eastern edge of the South Alkali Flat depression. The major axial streams in this subbasin are ephemeral Lordsburg Draw and Burro Cienega, its largest tributary. A shallow basin-fill aquifer with an area of about 315 krn2 at the eastern edge of the Lordsburg subbasin (China Draw section) contributes some underflow discharge to the western Mimbres basin system across the Continental Divide. Maximum basin-fill thickness is estimated to be about 600 m (Birch, 1980; O'Brien and Stone, 1984; Klein, 1995).

Maximum thickness of productive aquifer zones may locally exceed 200 m, but most ground-water production in the Animas-Cotton City-Lordsburg irrigation area is from the upper 150 m of saturated basin fill. A very optimistic estimate of available ground water of potable quality stored in the unconfined part of the saturated zone is no more than 1.2 x 1010 m3. Estimated annual recharge to the Lower Animas subbasin aquifer system is about 1.58 x I 07 m3. The major recharge sources are from the high ranges that flank the Opper Animas subbasin (Reeder, 1957; Hawkins, 1981; O'Brien and Stone, 1983). A very small component of ground-water flow from the thin \"perched\" aquifer zone in the Lake Cloverdale area may leak south- westward into the Sonora part of the adjacent San Bernardino basin; however, most ground water in the Cloverdale subbasin discharges as underflow into \"perched\" and \"deep\" aquifers of the Upper Animas sub- basin beneath the valleys of Animas Creek and its major tributaries. Underflow then moves northward toward agricultural and urban pump- ing centers in the Lower Animas subbasin. Under predevelopment con- ditions a large volume of ground water moved beyond the local ciene- gas and the Alkali Flat (vadose pk{va) area and discharged as underflow to the Duncan-Virden Valley segment of the Gila River basin aquifer system (Schwennesen, 1918; Reeder, 1957). O 'Brien and Stone ( 1983) estimate that the pre-development outflow from the Lower Animas sub- basin to this area was as much as 16 x I 06 m3/yr. Prior to ground-water pumpage in the Lower Playas subbasin, a small amount of underflow probably leaked into the Lower Animas subbasin through conduits in the structural gap between the Animas and Pyramid uplifts (Schwennesen, 19 I 8; Reeder, I 957; Doty, I 960).
