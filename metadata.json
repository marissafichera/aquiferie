An arid climate, limited surface water as streams or rivers, variable groundwater quality, and projected population increases make water resource management in the Tularosa Basin challenging. Groundwater accounts for approximately 70% of all water use in the area, including irrigation, domestic use, and public supply. It has been estimated that less than four percent of groundwater in the Tularosa Basin is fresh with total dissolved solids (TDS) of less than 1,000 milligrams per liter (mg/L). Most public supply wells pump relatively fresh water from very localized zones located on the eastern margin of the basin at the base of the Sacramento Mountains. Plans to pump and desalinate brackish water (1,000\u201310,000 mg/L TDS) for public water supply for Alamogordo are in development. There are concerns about the effect of pumping large quantities of brackish water on the water quality for multiple other users. To evaluate the potential impacts of pumping brackish water on existing water resources, it is necessary to know the spatial distribution of groundwater salinity. This report describes recent efforts by the New Mexico Bureau of Geology and Mineral Resources (NMBGMR) to assess the spatial distribution of groundwater salinity in the Tularosa Basin. The objectives of this study were to: 1) Compile and review existing water chemistry data in the area to assess the spatial distribution of groundwater salinity 2) Collect up to 30 water quality samples to address spatial and temporal data gaps 3) Using all data, provide an assessment of fresh and brackish water resources 4) Suggest future research to improve understanding of groundwater salinity in the Tularosa Basin The study area of interest focuses on the east-central portion of the Tularosa Basin, specifically around the communities of Tularosa and Alamogordo. The Tularosa Basin is a fault-bounded basin with the San Andres Mountains to the west and the Sacramento Moun- tains to the east. The basin is filled with 3,000\u20134,000 feet of sediment as a result of millions of years of erosion. Surface water from a few perennial and ephemeral streams that drain the Sacramento Mountains provide a portion of the water for public water supply and agriculture. These surface water resources are vulnerable to drought. Existing water chemistry data from historical reports, the NMBGMR, the United States Geologic Survey (USGS), and the New Mexico Environment Department (NMED) were compiled to identify spatial trends and data gaps. The data include water chemistry results from the last 100 years from research projects and monitoring programs. The NMED data are results from water quality testing and protection of public health. As part of this study, samples were collected from twenty-one domestic wells and analyzed for major cations and anions, trace metals, and stable isotopes of oxygen and hydrogen.

To the north, along the eastern margin of the basin, groundwater tends to be slightly brack- ish (1,000\u20133,000 mg/L TDS). In general, groundwater salinity increases toward the west. Samples collected in February 2016 exhibited the same trends as described above. On a large scale, the spatial distribution of groundwater salinity appears to be controlled by locations of groundwater recharge, as it mixes with more saline groundwater, and water/rock interactions. Groundwater recharge to the basin fill aquifer primarily occurs at the eastern margin of the basin, resulting in fresher water in this area. The westward increase in TDS concentrations is likely due to mixing of this fresher recharge water with saline water to the west and the dis- solution of minerals in the basin fill aquifer as it flows to the west. However, on a scale of hundreds to thousands of feet groundwater salinity is highly vari- able. This complexity is due in part to variations in porosity and permeability of sediments in the basin-fill aquifer, and the localized nature of groundwater recharge processes in the Tularosa Basin. For example, groundwater near La Luz Creek exhibits slightly lower TDS values due to local recharge from the creek. However, this trend was not observed for other streams, such as Rio Tularosa, which may reflect lithologic differences. Repeat TDS measure- ments for a few wells showed that TDS concentrations can change significantly over a few months and over the course of several years. The available data are insufficient to conclusively assess the possible effects of pumping brackish water upon existing water resources. However, the potential for deterioration of groundwater quality on both a short-term local scale and on a long-term regional scale exists. Increases in the pumping of brackish water may mobilize water in localized zones of different salinities, resulting in the deterioration of water quality in nearby wells. Prolonged pumping of brackish water may significantly affect the regional groundwater flow regime, and could cause encroachment of more saline water. Most wells are located in and around the local communities. The total population in the basin is relatively small and communities are separated by large expanses of ranches and feder- ally-owned land where no wells exist. Therefore, we cannot determine the salinity distribution in groundwater for a large proportion of the study area. This bias is also seen in the vertical salinity distribution. Most wells are less than 400 feet deep, which represents a very small proportion of the entire basin fill aquifer. We propose that future work includes the installa- tion of monitoring wells and the use of geophysical techniques, such as measurements of the electrical resistivity of the subsurface, to better characterize the three-dimensional distribution of groundwater salinity. 3 B r a c k i s h W a t e r A s s e s s m e n t i n t h e E a s t e r n T u l a r o s a B a s i n W ater resources in the Tularosa Basin are greatly limited due to the arid climate, scarce surface water and poor groundwater quality. In general, groundwater in the Tularosa Basin is characterized by a high total dissolved solids (TDS) content. It has been estimated that within the basin-fill aquifer, which covers an approximate area of 6,500 square miles and is thousands of feet deep in areas, less than four percent of stored groundwater is fresh with a TDS value of less than 1000 milligrams per liter (mg/L) (Orr and Myers, 1986). Local communities, including Alamogordo and Tularosa heavily rely on groundwater for public water supply, agriculture, and domestic use. For the entire basin, groundwater accounts for about 70% of all water diversions in 2010 (Longworth et al., 2013); it accounts for approximately 57% of the public water supply, 79% of irrigation diversions, and 100% of domestic water use. The quality of groundwater is suitable for some types of agriculture, but any deterioration in water quality will have significant negative impacts on crops in the Tularosa Basin. Residents of the areas surrounding Alamogordo and Tularosa are greatly impacted by the poor groundwater quality. Many residents with private wells rely on bottled water for drinking and use a water softener to treat well water for other uses including washing dishes and bathing. Currently, public water supplies for local com- munities barely meet demands, and some communi- ties periodically need to supplement the water supply with groundwater of poor quality (>1,000 mg/L), which must be blended with surface water to dilute the concentrations of dissolved minerals (New Mexico Office of the State Engineer, 2016). Water demand was projected to increase by 30% between the years 2000 and 2040 (Livingston and JS&A, 2002), mainly due to population growth. While poor water quality has largely been seen as a significant limitation in terms of water resources, the option of desalination of these brackish waters may signifi- cantly supplement the public water supply in the Tularosa Basin in the near future.

The 2016 draft of the Tularosa, Great Salt and Sacramento River Basins Regional Water Plan states I . I n t r o d u c t i o n that much of the groundwater in the region is brackish with TDS concentrations greater than 1,000 milli- grams per liter and that the development of brackish groundwater resources can be an additional source of water supply for this region. The Alamogordo Regional Water Supply Project is a plan to develop 4,000 acre-feet of brackish groundwater from the Tularosa Basin as a new source of water for the city of Alamogordo (BLM, 2012). This project will be discussed in more detail below. Most groundwater is produced from the basin fill aquifer, which is composed of gravel, sand, silt and clay. Previous studies (Mamer et al., 2014) have sug- gested that much of the groundwater in the Tularosa Basin is thousands of years old and that groundwa- ter recharge is limited. Therefore, there is concern about the depletion of potable water and the result- ing deterioration of the quality of groundwater being pumped. In addition, there is also concern about how the future pumping of brackish water for public water supply may affect the quality of existing groundwater resources, including public water supply, irrigation, domestic, and others. Variations in water quality within the basin-fill aquifer depend on many factors, including the location of the recharge area, the spatial arrangement of the different sediment types that make up the aquifer, and the density of the water; water with high TDS concentrations is more dense than water with low TDS concentrations. In order to under- stand how the pumping of brackish water may affect groundwater quality near the communities of Tularosa and Alamogordo, it is necessary to know the charac- teristics of fresh and brackish waters in the aquifer. In the subsequent sections of this report, the terminology that describes different ranges in ground- water salinity is defined in Table 1. For context, the average salinity of seawater is 35,000 mg/L.

The Tularosa Basin is a topographically closed basin with internal drainage that covers approximately 6,500 square miles and extends from Chupadera Mesa in the north to a gentle topographic rise in Texas that separates the Tularosa Basin and the Hueco Bolson. The basin is bounded on the west by the Oscura, San Andres and Franklin Mountains and on the east by the Sacramento Mountains and Otero Mesa. Alamogordo is the largest city in the Tularosa Basin, with a population of over 30,000. Other communities include La Luz, Tularosa, Oscuro, and Carrizozo. A large proportion of the basin is rangeland, much of which is occupied by military installations, including Fort Bliss Military Reservation, Holloman Airforce Base, and White Sands Missile Range. Although agriculture is limited due to an inade- quate fresh water supply, common crops include forage for livestock, pecans, pistachios, apples, and cherries. Geology T he present day landscape in the Tularosa Basin is primarily a result of tectonic forces associated with the Rio Grande rift, combined with extensive erosion over the past 25 million years. The Tularosa Basin is a fault-bounded basin (Figure 2, Figure 3) with two half-grabens (Figure 3). The eastern half-graben is bounded on the east by the west-down Alamogordo fault zone and on the west by the west-down Jarilla fault zone. The San Andres Fault defines the western edge of the basin. The surrounding mountains are mainly com- posed of volcanic and Paleozoic sedimentary rocks (Figure 2). The most current geologic descriptions of the western side of the Sacramento Mountains is provided by Koning et al. (2014) and Kelley et al. (2014) and is summarized by Mamer et al. (2014).

The geology along the steep western escarpment of the mountains varies considerably from north to south. These geologic variations significantly affect the groundwater chemistry. I I . S t u d y A r e a North of Three Rivers, the high mountain geology is dominated by upper Eocene and lower Oligocene volcanic rocks and igneous intrusives that effectively fill a structural low, called the Sierra Blanca Basin. To the immediate west, exposed rocks include highly faulted Cretaceous sandstones and shales. Another prominent feature in the norther portion of the basin is the basalt lava flow near Carrizozo. In the high mountains and west facing slopes to the south, the geology is characterized by highly faulted and fractured Paleozoic sedimentary rocks, includ- ing the San Andres, Yeso and Abo Formations. These rocks contain significant amounts of carbonates and evaporites (salts), which affect the water chemistry in this area. Since rifting began approximately thirty million years ago, the basin has filled with thousands of feet of alluvial-fan, piedmont-slope, alluvial-flat and playa deposits. Basin fill includes weakly to well consolidated sediment. The basin fill thickness is 3,000\u20134,000 feet thick near Tularosa (Mamer et al., 2014). The basin fill becomes finer grained with increasing distance from the mountain front. Alluvial fan deposits on the edge of the basin margin and allu- vial deposits in the basin consist of sand, gravel, silt and clay. In these areas channelization of sediments has resulted in zones of higher permeability, through which water can move more easily. In the central/ western part of the basin, lacustrine deposits are pre- dominantly clay with some fine sand layers. A unique feature of the western Tularosa Basin is the White Sands gypsum dune field. Underlying the dune field are recrystallized gypsum deposits and lacrustrine (lake) deposits, which are primarily clay (Orr and Myers, 1986). Orr and Myers (1986) describe a well log from a test well that was drilled to evaluate the availability of water from the deeper section of the basin fill deposits. The test well is located in the southern part of the basin and is almost 6,000 feet deep. The top 180 feet consists of coarse grained sand, silt, clay and gravel. The interval from 180 to approximately 3,620 feet below the sur- face consists primarily of clay with thin beds of fine and medium grained sand. At depths greater than 3,620 feet, the sediments consist of mostly sand with N E W M E X I C O B U R E A U O F G E O L O G Y A N D M I N E R A L R E S O U R C E S 6 Figure 1.

Geologic cross section of the Tularosa Basin. thin clay layers. It is difficult to correlate specific units from this well log to data from wells in other parts of the basin. However, it is reasonable to assume that the vertical distribution of sediments in much of the eastern margin of the basin can be characterized similarly with coarse sediments at shal- low depths (top few hundred feet), mostly clays at intermediate depths (~1,000\u20133,000 feet), and coarser sediments at depths greater that ~3,000 feet (Personal communication, Dan Koning, 2016). Toward the cen- ter of the basin, the vertical distribution of sediments is probably dominated by finer grained units (Orr and Myers, 1986) The characterization of sediments that make up the basin fill aquifer is important for understand- ing the hydrogeology of the Tularosa Basin, because water moves through different sediments at different rates. Fresh water that is moving from the adjacent mountains will preferentially flow through sediments of higher permeability, such as sands and gravels, while older groundwater, with higher TDS concentra- tions, may reside in finer sediments, such as silts and clays. Therefore the spatial arrangement of these sedi- ments in the subsurface largely controls the spatial distribution of groundwater salinity. Hydrogeology Surface Water T he study area is characterized by a semi-arid cli- mate with a mean annual rainfall ranging from 10 in/yr in the central parts of the basin to ~30 in/yr in the adjacent Sacramento Mountains. No major rivers flow through the Tularosa Basin, and the only avail- able surface water supplies are from springs, small streams, and artificial reservoirs in the Sacramento Mountains. There are four major stream systems that drain the western slopes of the Sacramento Mountains: Nogal Creek, Three Rivers, Rio Tularosa, and La Luz Creek (Figure 4). Three Rivers and Rio Tularosa are perennial, while the other streams are ephemeral, flowing primarily during the monsoon season (July through September). These drainages are important features because most groundwater recharge to the basin fill aquifer occurs along these streams (Mamer et al., 2014; Waltemeyer, 2001). Springs are the primary source for many streams in the area that drain into the Tularosa Basin. Spring discharge rates are generally low, less than 6 gallons per minute (gpm) (Mamer et al., 2014). 9 B r a"

Perennial and ephemeral streams in the Tularosa Basin. In the year 2000, approximately 25% of water diversions for all uses in the basin, including public water systems, domestic use, livestock, agriculture, etc., came from surface water (Livingston and JS&A, 2002). Currently, surface water makes up approxi- mately 70% of Alamogordo\u2019s public water supply. Because surface water is ultimately derived from snow melt and monsoon rains in the Sacramento Mountains, as a water supply it is very vulnerable to drought. Bonito Lake, located in the northern Sacramento Mountains, historically supplied many communities in the basin, including Alamogordo, with a significant amount of water via a pipeline. In 2012, the Little Bear fire damaged Bonito Lake, and it is not currently (presumably temporarily) supplying water to local communities. Groundwater Within the Sacramento Mountains domestic, irriga- tion, and stock wells produce water from a variety of sedimentary and volcanic geologic units. Mamer et al. (2014) describe how water moves from streams and aquifers in the mountains to the basin fill aquifer, which provides most groundwater resources for com- munities in the Tularosa Basin. It has been estimated that 8.9% of precipitation on the western slopes of the Sacramento Mountains provides recharge to the basin fill aquifer (~67,900 AFY) (Mamer et al. (2014). Although some of this recharge does move through the mountain block as groundwater, most recharge to the basin fill aquifer occurs at mouths of surface water drainages, where stream water infil- trates into porous alluvial fan material. Most groundwater used in the Tularosa Basin resides in the basin fill aquifer. Figure 5 shows the water table map for this aquifer. The water level elevation contours represent the surface of the top of the aquifer (water table). In general, groundwa- ter flows from high groundwater level elevations to low water level elevations. The water table map shows that groundwater flows from the north and east to the south and west, and supports the conclu- sions of Mamer et al. (2014) and other research- ers\u2019 (e.g., Meinzer and Hare, 1915; Orr and Myers, 1986; Waltemeyer, 2001) that the basin fill aquifer is recharged by precipitation in the Sacramento Mountains to the east. However, it appears that some groundwater is also flowing from the north. The semi-closed 3900 ft contour suggests that the area near Lake Lucero, an ephemeral playa, is a discharge area. Researchers have shown that ground- water leaves the groundwater system in this area N E W M E X I C O B U R E A U O F G E O L O G Y A N D M I N E R A L R E S O U R C E S 10 Figure 5.

Fresh groundwater can also be found in some localized zones in bedrock aquifers at higher elevations in the mountains. Most other wells, which including irrigation, domestic, and stock wells, produce slightly brackish water. Garza and McLean (1977) concluded that much of the slightly brackish groundwater near Tularosa appeared to be suitable for many of the crops grown in the basin. However, there was evidence that some crop yields may be slightly reduced due to high salt content of the water. Garza and McLean (1997) voiced concern about the encroachment of chemically inferior water (TDS >4,000 mg/L) from the west into the large irrigated area near Tularosa. In the center of the basin beneath Alkali Flats and White Sands dune field, the ground- water is brine with TDS values greater than 100,000 mg/L in some areas (Newton and Allen, 2014).

Conceptual model of groundwater salinity distribution along an east-west transect. electrical resistivity was measured in the subsurface at several depths at different positions along many transects that usually ran from the eastern margin of the basin to the west for a few miles. These types of geophysical techniques are advantageous for looking at the distribution of groundwater salinity. Most resistivity profiles completed by Orr and Myers (1986) show fresh or slightly brackish water on the far eastern margin of the Tularosa Basin at shallow depths and higher salinities with depth and towards the central/western part of the basin. Figure 7 shows a conceptual model that explains these observations. The interpretation of Orr and Myers (1986) is that precipitation in the Sacramento Mountains recharges the basin fill aquifer as fresh water and as it slowly moves to the west it mixes with brine in the basin fill. 13 B r a c k i s h W a t e r A s s e s s m e n t i n t h e E a s t e r n T u l a r o s a B a s i n one of these datasets. Therefore, these data sets were not combined into one dataset for statistical analyses. All datasets had several repeat samples at different times. For the statistical analyses, results from the most recent sample were used. In analyses that group the three data sets, it is important to note that many of the data points may be duplicated. Data gap analy- ses were primarily conducted by visual inspection on a GIS map and statistical analyses. Spatial analyses were conducted using ArcGIS. Samples were collected from twenty-one domes- tic wells and analyzed for major cations and anions, trace metals, and stable isotopes of oxygen and hydrogen. Sample locations were focused on the center of the study area near Tularosa and chosen to observe groundwater salinity along a north-south and east-west transect. The data are provided in Appendix A and will be discussed in more detail below. Standard sampling and analytical procedures used are described in Timmons et al. (2013). E xisting water chemistry data from the NMBGMR, USGS, and NMED were extracted and com- piled to identify spatial trends and data gaps. For the study area, there are 307, 188, and 77 wells from the NMBGMR, USGS, and NMED datasets, respectively. Each agency includes water chemis- try collected over the last 100 years from differ- ent research projects and monitoring programs. The NMED data has been collected specifically for water quality testing for the protection of public health. For wells in the study area, the NMBGMR database includes data from Mamer et al. (2014), Newton et al. (2012), McLean (1970), Huff (1996), John Shomaker & Associates, Inc. (2006) and the Brackish Groundwater National Desalination Research Facility (BGNDRF).

There are thousands of wells in the Tularosa basin, including municipal, irrigation, stock, and domestic wells. Figure 8 shows locations of all wells in the study area that are documented by the New Mexico Office of the State Engineer (NMOSE). The distribu- tion of wells is correlated to population density. Most wells are located in clusters around local communi- ties. Domestic and irrigation wells account for over 50% and 16% of these wells, respectively. The spatial distribution of wells results in a bias in the chemistry data because there are large areas where groundwater cannot be sampled. Figure 9 shows wells from all three data sets that have water chemistry data associated with them, including wells that were sampled in February of 2016 by the NMBGMR. While the wells with chem- istry data associated with them represent a very small proportion of the total number of wells in the study area, they are clustered around the same population centers where the majority of wells are found. Large areas where there are no groundwater chemistry data are primarily due to the fact that there are very few or no wells present in these areas. A survey of the total depth of these wells showed that most of them are less than 400 ft deep (Figure 10). The fact that most of the wells produce water in the top 400 ft of an aquifer system that is thousands of feet deep in some areas exposes a depth bias in the chemistry data. The water chemistry data sets are extremely vari- able in terms of constituents that were analyzed in the water samples. Some samples were tested for a full suite of major cations, anions, and trace metals, while many other samples were only tested for one or two constituents. For this study, the principal goal was to identify general spatial trends in salinity; therefore, TDS was the analyte of choice. However, all three data sets do not consistently have TDS calculations or measurements for every sample. A survey of the data reveals that SO4 is the most commonly popu- lated constituent. Figure 11 shows TDS as a function of SO4 along with a linear regression with a very high correlation coefficient (R2=0.99). We utilize this relationship between TDS and SO4 to maximize the amount of available data by using SO4 as a proxy for TDS. Table 2 shows the range in SO4 concentrations that correlates to the different categories of salinity. TDS values calculated with the equation shown in Figure 11 were compared to measured TDS values. In general, the proxy-estimated TDS values match the measured values reasonably well, especially for lower TDS waters (data not shown). However, for fresh and slightly brackish water, the predicted values may still differ from measured TDS concentrations by several hundreds of mg/L. For waters of higher salinity, the predicted values may differ by up to 2,000 mg/l. It is important to note that the water categorized into different salinities based on SO4 concentrations is somewhat imprecise. However, with such a large range of TDS values, the categorizations based on SO4 concentrations still exhibit relative salinity dif- ferences adequately. The analyses discussed below utilize TDS values for samples which have measured or calculated values and SO4 values for waters that do not have TDS data available. Figure 12A shows the wells classified as fresh, slightly brackish, brackish, saline, and brine. I V .

Based on the data we have compiled, we find that most of the fresh water on the eastern mar- gin of the basin is located south of Alamogordo (Figure 12C), where wellfields that supply water for Holloman Air Force Base are located.

To the southwest, along HWY 70 groundwater is mostly brackish with some saline water and brines in some areas. Wells near La Luz Creek produce mostly slightly brackish water (Figure 12C). North of La Luz Creek, groundwater quality appears to dete- riorate. Wells in the vicinity of Tularosa dominantly produce slightly brackish and brackish water. Most saline groundwater and brines in the study area are located in the western region. The conceptual model presented in Figure 7 shows zones of different TDS concentrations along a cross-section on the eastern edge of the basin. The model suggests that because groundwater recharge occurs at the interface between the mountains and the basin fill, groundwater in this area is the freshest. 19 B r a c k i s h W a t e r A s s e s s m e n t i n t h e E a s t e r n T u l a r o s a B a s i n From the limited data shown above (Figure 12), it appears TDS values in groundwater generally increase to the west, consistent with the conceptual model. This trend is probably due to mixing of relatively fresh groundwater coming in from the east and high TDS brines to the west and water-mineral interac- tions. Figure 13 also provides evidence for these processes. Sulfate is shown as a function of the ratio of SO4 to bicarbonate (HCO3). HCO3 in groundwater is primarily derived from limestone in the subsurface. Paleozoic rocks in the Sacramento Mountains con- tain limestones, and groundwater in the Sacramento Mountains near Alamogordo and Tularosa generally has a chemical signature indicative of the dissolution of limestone (Mamer et al., 2014). In these waters, HCO3 is the dominant anion (negative ion), and therefore the samples are characterized by a small SO4/HCO3 ratio. SO4 in groundwater is usually the result of the dissolution of gypsum. As discussed above, recrystallized gypsum deposits and lacrustrine deposits are present in the subsurface farther toward the center of the basin (Orr and Myers, 1986). Figure 13 shows that as SO4 concentrations increase, the SO4/HCO3 ratios also increase. This observation can be explained by the mixing of incoming fresh water from the mountains with brines in the basin fill aquifer, and the continual evolution of water chemis- try due to water-mineral interactions. In addition, at higher TDS concentrations the relationship between SO4 and SO4/HCO3 ratios becomes increasingly non-linear (Figure 13). This phenomenon may reflect variations in water-mineral reaction rates at higher salinities, and the diminishing role of freshwater recharge at greater distances from recharge areas along the basin margin. Orr and Myers\u2019 (1986) electrical resistivity sur- veys and the data discussed above suggest a relatively uniform progression of increasing salinity from the eastern margin of the basin in a westward direction following the general direction of groundwater flow (east to west/ southwest). However, the large spatial variability of salinity shown in Figure 12A and the actual data shown along a transect near Alamogordo (Figure 14) suggest a more complex system. While the lowest TDS values are at the eastern margin of the basin (between twenty and twenty-five miles on the transect) there are no water samples with TDS values less than 1,000 mg/L. Rather, these waters are slightly brackish. Figure 12 shows that this is typical of most areas along the eastern margin of the basin, with the exception of very localized areas south of Alamogordo. Moving to the west along the transect shown in Figure 14, between miles fifteen and twenty, there is a mixture of slightly brackish and brackish waters. Then, at approximately the eleven mile mark, there are two relatively shallow wells that produce 0 500 1,000 1,500 2,000 2,500 3,000 3,500 4,000 4,500 5,000 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 SO4 (mg/L) SO4/HCO3 (mass ratio) Fresh water Brackish water Slightly brackish water Saline water Mixing of fresh water and saline water Figure 13.

TDS data indicate a more complicated system with a large range of TDS values in the different zones. saline water and brine. Further to the west, between zero and five miles, most wells produce brackish water. One deeper well in this area produces saline water. It is also apparent that water chemistry from existing wells provides information about only a very small proportion of the basin fill aquifer, in the shal- lowest groundwater. Previous work using geophysical methods such as that performed by Orr and Myers (1986) has helped to assess the spatial variability of groundwater salin- ity in the Tularosa Basin. It should be noted that there were large distances between resistivity measurements made by Orr and Myers (1986) along each transect, which required considerable interpolation between measurement points to define different zones of dif- ferent ranges in salinity. The water chemistry data discussed above shows that the salinity of ground- water in the study area is highly variable on a fairly small spatial scale. This variability is probably due to the spatial distribution of the different sediments that make up the aquifer and the different rates of recharge in different areas. Chemistry data for well samples collected by NMBGMR in February, 2016 (Table 3, Figure 15) exhibit similar trends to those observed for other compiled chemistry data that has been collected over the last 100 years. All samples except one have TDS values between 1,000 and 3,000 mg/L, and therefore are classified as slightly brackish water. The lowest TDS waters were observed near La Luz Creek (Figure 15), with values ranging from 1,230 to 1,890 mg/L. These values are consistent with other TDS values in the area as seen on Figure 12B. The relatively low TDS values in this area are due to local recharge from La Luz Creek. Interestingly, this apparent effect of a local stream on the nearby groundwater chemistry is not nearly as pronounced for the area around the Rio Tularosa (Figure 15) for reasons that are unknown. There is one domestic well, located just north of the Rio Tularosa that exhibits a TDS value less than 2,000 mg/L. Other wells along the Rio Tularosa have similar TDS concentrations that range from 2,360 to 2,790 mg/L. These observations, again, demonstrate the high spatial variability of groundwater salinity. One of the principal motivations for this study is a concern about how pumping brackish water may affect water utilized by existing public supply, irrigation, and domestic wells. There is anecdotal evidence reported by some land owners and irriga- tors of water quality changes in water from some wells during a prolonged period of pumping, such as irrigation season.

Wells 2, 3, and 4, which are com- pleted to similar total depths (185\u2013225 ft.), show fluctuations in TDS of up to 1,000 mg/L between March of 2011 and December of 2015. The observed TDS value for Well 1, which has a total depth of 1,345 ft., increased from 1,180 mg/L in July 2013 to 2,650 mg/L in November 2013 and then decreased to 1,290 mg/L by December 2014. There are several wells that were sampled by the USGS multiple times during the 1950s and 60s. Figure 17 shows data and locations for selected wells that were described by McLean (1970). These wells were all supply wells for Holloman Airforce Base, located within 1.5 miles of each other, and have total depths between 175 and 370 feet below the surface. The TDS concentrations for five of the seven wells were rather constant over time, while water produced by two wells, BW-0400 and BW-0406, fluctuate substantially over the eleven year period. BW-0400 and BW-0406 have total depths of 260 and 205 ft, respectively. Interestingly, BW-0402 is 240 ft deep and does not show significant fluctuations of TDS concentration. The northernmost well sampled by NMBGMR in 2016 (Figure 15) showed an increase in TDS from 2,802 mg/L in August 2010 to 3,320 mg/L in February 2016. There is thus evidence that TDS values of groundwater at a specific location can change significantly over time. Figure 17.

With a goal to assess the spatial variability of groundwater salinity in the eastern Tularosa Basin, focusing on areas around Tularosa and Alamogordo, it immedi- ately became clear that analyzing the data from these public, domestic, and irrigation wells introduces bias. Wells are located mostly in and around population centers and lack spatial distribution across the entire study area. Therefore, we cannot determine the salin- ity distribution in groundwater for a large proportion of the study area without additional well coverage. This bias is also apparent for the vertical salinity distribution. Most wells are less than 400 feet deep, which represents a very small proportion of the entire basin fill aquifer, which in some areas can be thou- sands of feet thick. Much work has been done in this area with respect to water quality and availability (Orr and Myers, 1986; Mamer et al., 2014; Garza and McLean, 1977; McLean, 1970), and now much of these data are compiled electronically. A review of groundwater chemistry data that was obtained from the USGS, NMED, and NMBGMR databases con- firms many observations made by other researchers. 1. Most of the fresh water is located in alluvial fan deposits south of Alamogordo, where several public supply wells are located. 2. Most groundwater in and around Tularosa is slightly brackish to brackish. 3. In general, shallow groundwater near the eastern margin of the basin is fresh or slightly brackish due to incoming recharge from the Sacramento Mountains. 4. In general, TDS concentrations increase towards the west and with depth as a result of fresh recharge mixing with saline water and brines. V . C o n c l u s i o n s The spatial trends in groundwater salinity described above exist on a large scale (miles). On a scale of hundreds to thousands of feet, TDS values vary considerably. Factors that control the spatial dis- tribution of groundwater salinity include the physical arrangement of different sediment types in the aqui- fer, proximity to ephemeral and perennial streams, and the rate of recharge in different areas. The variability in groundwater salinity has implications for the effects of pumping brackish water as a resource on the water quality of current fresh or slightly brackish water that is being used. On a large scale (years), prolonged pumping of brackish water in the area of Tularosa may cause groundwater with much higher TDS concentrations to the west to encroach on water resources being used for agricul- ture in local communities. This concern has been voiced by other researchers (e.g., Garza and McLean, 1977). Bourret (2015) constructed a groundwater model of the Tularosa Basin and simulated ground- water flow under different pumping scenarios, includ- ing pumping from the Snake Tank Well Field as is proposed for the Alamogordo Regional Water Supply Project. Under some scenarios, the simulated cone of depression was quite large and did significantly change the flow direction of groundwater in the sur- rounding area.

Under some scenarios, the simulated cone of depression was quite large and did significantly change the flow direction of groundwater in the sur- rounding area. On a smaller spatial scale, the presence of local- ized zones of variable salinity (Figure 12) suggests that seasonal pumping may have an effect on water chemistry in existing wells. Most residents with domestic wells are already impacted by water of poor quality and do not drink their well water. A slight deterioration of their water quality would probably have a limited impact on them. However, ranchers and farmers may be severely impacted by a slight deterioration in the quality of their water. N E W M E X I C O B U R E A U O F G E O L O G Y A N D M I N E R A L R E S O U R C E S 24 T here is evidence that water quality in a well can change significantly with time. More research is needed to understand the mechanisms behind this temporal variability in water chemistry. In order to accurately determine or predict pos- sible changes to water quality that may result from large scale pumping, more detailed, depth-specific water quality data would be required. The use of water chemistry from existing well samples alone is inadequate for the assessment of the spatial vari- ability of groundwater salinity due to bias in existing well locations. Large data gaps exist in areas with no wells. We suggest the installation of additional wells to fill in some of these spatial and vertical data V I . F u t u r e W o r k R e c o m m e n d a t i o n s gaps, along with geophysical surveys. New geophysi- cal surveys could improve upon the work of Orr and Myers (1986), who used older technology in electrical resistivity in conjunction with well data to examine the distribution of fresh and slightly brackish water in the Eastern Tularosa Basin with much success. Currently, there are many electromagnetic (EM) methods that are used to image the electrical con- ductivity (or resistivity) of rocks and fluids in the subsurface. Different methods provide data at dif- ferent scales. Figure 18 shows an electrical resistivity survey that was conducted at White Sands National Monument (Newton and Allen, 2014). The image shows a moderately resistive zone in green overlying a low resistivity zone (blue). The moderately resis- tive zone represents fresh to slightly brackish water in sand which is sitting on top of brines that reside in low permeability clays below the dune field. We highly recommend to include these types of method- ologies, along with the installation of additional wells for control points to better understand the spatial distribution of fresh and brackish water resources in the Tularosa Basin.

Scientists from all fields conduct research on a variety of topics, ranging from geology to evolutionary biology. One very interesting feature at WHSA is a very shallow water table. Within the dune field in WSHA, depth to water in interdunal areas ranges from one to three feet below the surface. This type of dune field is called a wet dune system, and the shal- low groundwater directly affects dune processes. Groundwater effectively stabilizes sand that has accumulated for thousands of years. At WHSA, up to thirty feet of gypsum sand is stored below interdunal areas. A significant decrease in groundwater levels in the dune aquifer system would likely make much of this accumulated sand more available for transport by wind, signifi- cantly changing dune dynamics as well as local ecosystems and habitats.

Local communities, such as Alamogordo and Tularosa, are actively looking for new water sources, and will likely begin desalinating brackish groundwater in the near future. Increases in groundwater pumping and changes in precipitation trends due to climate change may have a severe impact on regional groundwater levels throughout the basin.

Therefore, the National Park Service, is concerned about changes in local water levels at WHSA as a result of increased groundwater pumping in the Tularosa Basin and possible effects of climate change. In 2009, researchers at the New Mexico Bureau of Geology and Mineral Resources began a hydrologic study at WHSA with the primary goals of : 1) Identifying water sources that contribute to the shallow hydrologic system in the dune field, and 2) Assessing the interactions between the shallow aquifer in the dune field and the larger regional system. Moneys obtained over several years from the NPS were used to fund the following activities: \u2022 Monitoring of water levels in several monitoring wells at WHSA \u2022 Geochemical analyses of groundwater samples \u2022 Monitoring of hydrologic parameters in the unsaturated zone within a dune \u2022 Aquifer tests \u2022 Geophysical surveys The results of this study show clear evidence that the dune field is a recharge area. Groundwater-levels within the dune field respond to local precipitation events very quickly. Hydraulic gradients in the unsaturated zone within the dunes are fairly constant in a downward direction. It appears that pore spaces within the dunes usually store the maximum amount of water that can be held against the pull of gravity (field capacity). Therefore, when it rains, water stored in the dunes is quickly flushed downward. During the hottest and driest part of the year (March \u2013 June), when evaporation rates are at their highest, the hydraulic gradient in the top one to three feet of the dunes is in the upward direction due to water evaporating from E x e c u t i v e S u m m a r y N E W M E X I C O B U R E A U O F G E O L O G Y A N D M I N E R A L R E S O U R C E S 2 the shallow unsaturated sand. Once the monsoon rains begin, hydraulic gradients in the upper part of the unsaturated zone quickly change back to the downward direction. Groundwater chemistry also indicates that local precipitation recharges the shallow aquifer within the dune field. In particular, groundwater located directly below the dunes appears to have the lowest total dissolved solids (TDS) values and is the youngest groundwater observed in the study area. In contrast, groundwater beneath interdunal areas is observed to have much higher TDS values and is significantly older than the fresher water found beneath the dunes. This older water probably represents a regional component that originates from basin-fill sedi- ments to the east and below the gypsum sand. Electrical resistivity data shows that, volumetri- cally, this regional component is the dominant water source that is present in the overall shallow system in the gypsum sand. Shallow ground water-levels just to the east and west of the dune field do not respond to individual rain events, but show a gradual increase throughout the monsoon season (July \u2013 September), mainly due to increased water-levels in the shallow dune aquifer. Water-levels in these areas area continue to increase through March due to a decrease in evaporation rates, followed by a steady decline between March and June as evaporation rates increase. Water chemistry and electrical resistivity data suggest that groundwater flows from the shallow aqui- fer in the dune field to the shallow groundwater systems both to the east and west of the dune field. On the eastern edge of the dune field, the stratigraphy of the basin-fill sediments help to focus relatively fresh recharge from the dune aquifer through the more permeable layers. In many areas along the eastern margin of the dune field, this shallow \u201cfresh\u201d groundwater would be relatively easy to access, which is probably why most archeology sites are found in these areas. Stratigraphic control of shallow groundwater flow is also observed on the western edge of the dune field, where localized perched aquifers sit on top of clay layers. An aquifer test was conducted to assess interactions between the shallow dune aquifer and the somewhat deeper groundwater system in deposits below the accumulation of gypsum sand. A pumping well and an observation well were installed approximately sixty feet apart from each other with screened intervals from 145 to 195 feet below the surface. The screened inter- vals are well below the gypsum sand/ basin-fill interface, which is about thirty feet below the surface at this location. The pumping well is located about twelve feet from a shallow observa- tion well installed in the gypsum dune aquifer. Deposits between the depths of about 25 and 100 feet consist of interbedded to interlaminated clay and silty fine gypsum sand, commonly containing an abundance of coarse, secondary selenite crystals. Beneath 105 feet, the strati- graphic succession contains a relatively large proportion of clay, and thin, siliciclastic silty sand interbeds increase in abundance below a depth of 165 feet. Discharge at about four gallons per minute for approximately three days resulted in over one hundred feet of drawdown in the pumping well and over thirty feet of drawdown in the observation well screened over the same depth interval. This significant drawdown is due to the low permeability expected for the very fine-grained clay beds at depth. Despite the large draw- down observed in the deeper aquifer, no drawdown was observed in the shallow aquifer during or after the test. Therefore, interactions between the shallow and somewhat deep groundwater systems did not occur under the test conditions. From the results of this study, we have constructed a conceptual hydrogeologic model of the shallow groundwater system in the dune field within WHSA. Geologic, hydrologic, and geo- chemical data indicate that the shallow groundwater system in the gypsum dune field is a single aquifer that is separate from the shallow systems to the east and west and the deeper"

Toward the eastern and western edges of the dune field the shallow aquifer behaves as a perched aquifer with a downward gradient that results in groundwater flowing from the shallow dune aquifer to adjacent shallow groundwater systems on both sides. The shallow dune aquifer is recharged by local precipitation, while very little infiltra- tion occurs outside the dune field. Local recharge is observed in the dune aquifer and is easily identified by geochemical and isotope data. Groundwater discharges by evaporation throughout the study area. Aquifer test data also suggest that the dune aquifer appears to be relatively isolated from the underlying groundwater system due to the thick sequence very fine-grained deposits of low permeability that lies below the accumulated gypsum sand. However, a regional source undoubtedly accounts for the bulk of the water in the shallow dune groundwater system. This regional groundwater component has a distinct geochemical signature and is greater than 10,000 years old. More research is needed to determine where and how this groundwa- ter enters the shallow system As an extension of this study, we are currently using numerical modeling techniques to quantify the volumetric flux of regional groundwater that makes its way into the shallow dune aquifer and to examine the time scale on which changes in regional ground water-levels will affect water-levels in the shallow dune aquifer system. The final report that describes these models is due in 2015.

The principle objective of this study is to develop a conceptual model of the shallow groundwater system within the gypsum dune field with the intent to increase our understand- ing of how it interacts with the larger, regional hydrologic system. The monument, which encompasses approximately 115 square miles, includes a portion of the largest gypsum dune field in the world. In addition to preserving this unique desert landscape, WHSA serves as a natural laboratory for a variety of research topics, ranging from geology to ecology and evolutionary biology (Fryberger, 2001; Rasmussen, 2012; Kocurek and Ewing, 2005; Szynkiewicz et al., 2008; Kocurek et al., 2010; Scheidt et al., 2010; Langford, 2003; Kocurek et al., 2006; Jerolmack et al., 2011; Jerolmack et al., 2012; Allmendinger and Titus, 1973; Stockwell et al., 1998; Rogowski et al., 2006; Szynkiewicz et al., 2009). The dune field is what is known as a \u201cwet eolian system,\u201d (Kocurek and Havholm, 1993; Ewing et al., 2006) (Figure 1), due to the presence of a very shallow water table that effectively stabilizes accumulated sand beneath the dunes. In wet eolian systems a gradual increase in the water table results in a long-term accumulation of dune and interdunal (between dunes) deposits. Conversely, a decrease in the water table may result in the deflation of interdunal deposits and a net decrease in the amount of sand stored in the dune field. Therefore, a change in the shallow groundwater system, whether natural or anthropogenic, will significantly change dune processes, and the local ecosystem. I . I N T R O D U C T I O N The gypsum dune field is located in the Tularosa Basin, which has limited water resources. The cities of Tularosa and Alamogordo, which are located just to the east of WHSA, derive their water supply from surface water and groundwater. Surface water comes from streams in the Sacramento Mountains, which are very vulnerable to drought and has decreased significantly in recent years. Pumping additional fresh groundwater is limited by availability, administrative rules, and land ownership. Currently, the City of Alamogordo 40-year water development plan (Livingston and Shomaker, 2006) identifies the need for new water sources, including the Alamogordo Regional Water Supply Project (ARWSP), which involves desalination of brackish groundwater. Increasing population and uncertainty in the regional climate may result in significant increase in groundwater pumping from the regional basin-fill aquifer. The motivation for this study is a concern about how the shallow aquifer sys- tem in the gypsum dune field will respond to this increased pumping in the regional aquifer.

Description of Study Area W HSA is located in the Tularosa Basin in southern New Mexico (Figure 2). The Tularosa Basin is a topographically closed basin bounded on the east by the Sacramento Mountains, to the west by the Franklin, Organ, and San Andres Mountains. To the north, Chupadera Mesa is the basinal bound- ary, and in the south, a gentle topographic rise separates the Tularosa Basin from the Hueco Bolson. The monument encompasses approxi- mately 225 square miles, which includes 115 square miles of the 275 square miles of gypsum sand dunes (Figure 3). In the western portion of the monument, Alkali Flat (Figure 4) is characterized as a large flat expanse of sand with active playas, such as Lake Lucero on the western edge. The dune field (Figure 5), which makes up a large percentage of the monument, is made up of white gypsum sand dunes, interdunes, and sand sheets (Fryberger, 2001). In this report, the term \u201cdune field\u201d refers to the entire area with in the Monument that contains these features. Within the dune field, \u201cthe Heart of the Dunes\u201d refers to an area frequented by visitors due to accessibility by roads main- tained by NPS. This is the area where tourists typically spend the day sliding down the dunes on sleds. Near the eastern boundary of WHSA, the landscape is characterized by a sharp boundary (Figure 6), with dunes to the west and basin-fill deposits to the east. Figure 2.

N E W M E X I C O B U R E A U O F G E O L O G Y A N D M I N E R A L R E S O U R C E S 8 Geologic Background W HSA lies on the eastern side of the Basin and Range physiographic province in a region with large intermontane basins that are internally drained and undissected compared to the deeply entrenched Rio Grande valley just to the west (Hawley, 1993). The monument lies within one of these topographically closed basins (Tularosa basin), which encompasses an area of about 5400 square miles (14,000 km2) (Figure 8). The mountains on either side of the Tularosa basin are generally capped by Paleozoic sedimen- tary rocks (in contrast to the highest mountain, Sierra Blanca, which is composed largely of a complex of Tertiary-age igneous rocks). In general the sedimentary rocks capping the eastern mountain blocks dip to the east; on the west side they are tilted toward the west. Based on this general observation early geological reports regarding the basin (e.g., Herrick, 1904; Meinzer and Hare, 1915; Darton, 1928) consid- ered the overall structure of the basin to be that of a large, north-south trending anticline, with or without (depending on the report) major faults along the basin-bounding mountain fronts. Subsequent work has expanded on this theme to recognize that the floor of the basin has dropped by faulting relative to the border- ing mountain uplifts due to regional extensional stresses in Earth's crust that occurred during Neogene time. Faulting beneath the covered floor of the basin is also thought to be present Another feature that should be noted is Lost River (Figure 7), an ephemeral stream that drains a large area on the Sacramento Mountains, including La Luz Creek. Lost River is usually dry but conveys significant amounts of water in flash floods associated with monsoon rains in the mountains. This mountain runoff feeds multiple playas in the dune field. There is also a small perennial reach of Lost River in the dune field where the channel intersects the regional water table. This water is highly saline and is home to the endangered White Sands Pupfish (Rogowski et al., 2006). Figure 7.

This structural feature is of potential interest to the study of the groundwater system in the vicinity of the monument because faults may exert significant controls on the behavior of groundwater flow systems. Although the Jarilla fault is covered by alluvium and its precise location is poorly constrained in terms of direct surface expression (fault scarps), its inferred position suggests that it passes closely to the eastern side of the White Sands dune field (Figure 10). The thickness of the basin-fill underlying Tularosa basin, and the distribution of bedrock units beneath the basin-fill, are similarly poorly documented due to a lack of robust (e.g., deep-borehole and/or seismic-survey) data. Peterson and Roy (2005) suggest up to about five to ten thousand feet of basin-fill beneath the floor of the basin, based on gravity data and various model assumptions. During the last ice age, the Tularosa Basin contained perennial lakes, the largest of which is known as Lake Otero. During wetter periods Lake Otero expanded to a surface elevation of about 3,950 feet (1,204 m) and covered at least 290 square miles (750 km2) (Allen et al., 2009). Sierra Blanca, with an elevation of over 11,800 feet (3600 m), was capped by a small mountain glacier during the last ice age as well (Smith and Ray, 1941). After Lake Otero dried up during the end of the last ice age, excavation of the relict lake floor by the wind resulted in the formation of a large (~160 square mile) deflation basin, Alkali Flat (Figure 10), the floor of which is periodically covered by shallow water after heavy precipita- tion events. Lake Lucero is the lowest (eleva- tion ~3,887 feet) wind-deflated area on Alkali Flat; the White Sands dune field lies along the eastern side of the flat. The deposits of ancient Lake Otero contain an abundance of gypsum, and evaporation of ephemeral surface brines on present-day Alkali Flat results in the precipita- tion of new gypsum crystals as well. Prevailing winds from the southwest have thus transported gypsum grains from Alkali Flat eastward for millennia where they have been deposited to form the White Sands. During the past several decades investiga- tors involved in various projects have drilled a number of shallow holes within the monument boundary. Notable is an effort conducted Figure 9.

Geologic logs compiled during the construction of these moni- toring wells, along with information collected for other studies (e.g., McKee and Moiola, 1975; Kocurek et al., 2007), suggest that the gypsum sand beneath interdunal areas is on the order of eighteen to thirty feet thick.

In general, water quality decreases with depth and proximity to the center of the basin. In the center of the basin, lacustrine deposits, which can be as thick as 3,440 feet, are saturated with saline water. More permeable sand units may exist beneath these lacustrine deposits. Several groundwater investigations which have been conducted on Holloman Air Force Base, White Sands Missile Range, and WHSA, focused on water availability and potential groundwater contamination (Huff, 1996; Basabilvazo et al., 1994; Balance, 1967; Stone, 1991). Depth to groundwater in supply wells located south of Alamogordo ranges from 70 to 300 feet below the ground surface. Huff (1996) showed that in many of these supply wells, discharge equaled or exceeded recharge. Groundwater quality decreases to the west. Depth to water also decreases to the west. The general hydrology at WHSA has been described by Allmendinger and Titus (1973) and Fryberger (2001). Depth to groundwater is very shallow in the dune field and Alkali Flat, ranging from zero to 3 feet below the surface. These shallow water-levels in this area, which has the lowest elevations within the basin, were attributed to the accumulation of ground- water coming from the mountains over time. Allmendinger and Titus (1973) identified a depression in the water table in the area near Lake Lucero, which was interpreted to be due to the discharge of groundwater through soil evaporation. This water table depression can be seen in Figure 11 as a large semi-closed contour (3900 feet) that encompasses a large area on the western edge of the basin. Although it is thought that groundwater in the Tularosa Basin mainly discharges into the Rio Grande near El Paso, Szynkiewicz et al. (2009) identifies the White Sands playa system to be a sub-basin with a closed drainage system. Sulfur isotopic com- positions of gypsiferous sediments near Lake Lucero indicate that the origin of this gypsum is the dissolution of lower and middle Permian rocks that lie beneath the basin-fill sediments. This evidence suggests that groundwater in the 13 W h i t e S a n d s Figure 11. Regional water table map. Groundwater primarily flows from Northeast to Southwest. Closed contours on western edge of the basin suggest that groundwater is discharging by evaporation. Modified from Embid and Finch (2011).

Whether or not evaporation through soils represent local or regional discharge, it is clear that evaporation plays an important role in the shallow hydrology within the study area. Groundwater levels within the entire study area are largely controlled by evaporation through the shallow unsaturated zone, resulting in higher water-levels during the winter when evaporation rates are low and lower water levels during the summer, when evaporation rates are high (Allmendinger and Titus, 1973; Fryberger, 2001). Barud-Zubillaga (2000) asserted that the groundwater flow direction in the dune field was more from east to west than is observed by the regional hydraulic gradient. He also observed physical and chemical responses to precipita- tion events in the shallow groundwater system within the monument. Seasonal groundwater level fluctuations were observed with increases during the monsoon season and overall declines during the winter months. A decrease in electri- cal conductance of groundwater as a response to precipitation events indicates local recharge to the shallow aquifer. It is generally accepted that the shallow groundwater system in the dune field plays a role in dune dynamics (Kocorek et al., 2007). Langford et al. (2009) tested the hypothesis that groundwater salinity largely controlled dune morphology. The spatial variability observed for groundwater salinity roughly correlates with dune type. Dune morphology in the dune field changes from west (upwind) to east (downwind), with rapidly migrating barchan dunes in the west gradually transitioning into parabolic dunes that are stabilized by vegetation on the eastern edge of the dune field. Groundwater salinity decreases, and the elevation of interdune areas increases from west to east. Langford et al. (2009) asserts that local precipitation that infiltrates through the sand at the higher eleva- tions to the east, forms a fresh water lens that is available for vegetation, which in turn stabilizes the sand to form parabolic dunes. The barchan dunes to the west are located at a lower eleva- tion deflation surface that intersects the regional saline water table. This conceptual model will be discussed in more detail below. Purpose and Scope M ost researchers agree that the shallow groundwater system plays an important role in dune processes at WHSA. There have been many studies that focus on specific components of the local hydrologic system within the dune field and how it controls dune processes. This study however is the first comprehensive investi- gation of the shallow groundwater system within the context of the regional groundwater system in the Tularosa Basin. The primary objectives of this study are: \u2022 Identify water sources that contribute to the shallow groundwater system in the dune field \u2022 Assess the connectivity and interactions between the shallow groundwater system in the dune field and the system directly below the gypsum sand aquifer.

This Open-file Report serves as the final deliverable for the contract with the NPS. Data and inter- pretation from this study will improve under- standing of the local groundwater system and will help the NPS to make important decisions regarding the conservation of this important natural resource. 15 W h i t e S a n d s Data Description and Purpose E xisting and previously reported data used in this study include published geologic maps, subsurface geologic data from well records and lithologic logs, hydrologic consultants\u2019 reports, weather station data, and historical depth-to- water and water quality data from published and unpublished sources. New data collected by the NMBGMR, and NPS staff from 2009 to 2012 include: \u2022 Subsurface geologic unit descriptions from well cuttings \u2022 GPS measurements of field site locations (UTM) and detailed characterization of well sites \u2022 One-time and repeated depth-to-water measurements in wells \u2022 Continuous matric potential measurements at different depths that provide information on hydraulic gradients in the vadose zone \u2022 One-time and repeated geochemical, isoto- pic, and environmental tracer sampling from wells, springs, streams, and precipitation \u2022 Aquifer test data that consists of continuous water-level measurements in the pumping and observation wells over a time period that significantly goes beyond the duration of the test \u2022 Precipitation amount and other climate data Details about the new data collected and techniques used for this study are described below. In this report, we use the terms \u201cregional\u201d and \u201clocal\u201d to describe large and small scale observations, respectively. When the terms regional or large-scale are used, we are referring to the Tularosa Basin-scale hydrologic I I . m e t h o d s system. Local or small-scale terminology refers to the shallow system in the study area. Location of Sites A ll sample and measurement sites (Figure 12) (wells, exploration holes, tensiometers, precipitation collectors) were located using a hand-held Garmin 76 or 76S global position- ing system (GPS). The locations of many of the observations wells were surveyed with a TOPCOM differential GPS. Water-Level Data F or this study monitoring wells shown in Figure 12 are identified as WS-###. Most of these monitoring wells were installed by WHSA. However a few shallow monitoring wells were installed by NMBGMR, and two deep wells (WS-017 and WS-018) were installed by the USGS. Monitoring wells WS-007 \u2013 WS-015 (Table 1), which are located within and out- side the dune field, range in depth from 18 to 40 feet deep and are generally screened over the entire water column. Monitoring wells WS-019 \u2013 WS-022 are located within the dune field and are usually less than 6 feet deep and are also screened over the entire water column. Piezometers installed by NMBGMR which are less than 15 feet deep, are screened over a rela- tively short depth interval, and sealed above the screened interval with bentonite. WS-017 and WS-018 are approximately 200 feet deep with the screened interval between 140 and 195 feet. Water-level measurements can provide insight about the occurrence and direction of groundwater flow. The water-level in a well is a N E W M E X I C O B U R E A U O F G E O L O G Y A N D M I N E R A L R E S O U R C E S 16 measure of potential energy or head. Water flows from high head to low head. Therefore, a change in water-levels in wells, with respect to a com- mon datum over a horizontal distance indicates the direction of lateral groundwater flow. These data can also help determine if groundwater water is moving vertically. Repeated water-level measurements and/or continuous measurements provide information about daily, monthly and seasonal fluctuations that occur in an aquifer system. Water-level measurements in most wells were made on a quarterly basis between 2010 and Fall 2012. From a specific measuring point on each well casing, depth to water measurements were made by staff of WHSA using a Solinst\u2122 electronic sounder. During the course of the study, most wells were also monitored with con- tinuous water-level recorders. These were pro- grammed to record water-level and temperature at hourly intervals. Tensiometer Data A s part of the goal of assessing the sources of water that recharge the shallow aquifer within the dune field, we conducted a vadose zone investigation to determine the significance of local precipitation contributing to ground- water recharge. For this part of the study, we used instruments called tensiometers to measure Figure 12.

Principles of tensiometers are discussed in detail by Yeh and Guzman-Guzman (1995). In this report the data are reported in feet of water, and most values are negative. These negative values can be thought to represent the potential of the unsaturated medium to pull water up a certain distance by capillary action. For example, -3 feet of water indicates that the soil being measured can pull water up three feet. Matric potential is a function of soil texture and water content. In general, drier soils have higher (more negative) matric potentials because more of the smaller pores not filled with water. In the unsaturated zone, matric potential must be considered along with gravitational potential to evaluate the vertical hydraulic gradient, and the direction of water flow. By measuring the matric potential in the sand dunes at different depths, we can determine whether pore water is moving upward or downward. The tensiometers we are using are equipped with pressure transducers that measure the matric potential on an hourly time interval. Geochemical Methods C hemical and isotopic analyses of precipitation, stream, and well waters provide insight into the flow path of groundwater, where it is recharged, and its residence time in the subsur- face. For this study, water was sampled for a number of analyses including major ion chem- istry, trace metal chemistry, stable isotopes of oxygen and hydrogen, and several naturally occurring environmental tracers which provide estimates of groundwater age. Sampling and analytical methods are described in detail in Timmons et al. (2013). Precipitation W e collected precipitation on WHSA using a simple collection device made of a funnel, a tube, and a one-gallon glass bottle. In the winter, a 1-foot section of 4 inch PVC pipe was attached to the funnel to allow snow to accumulate. The total volume of water that accumulated in the glass sample vessel between sampling events was measured, and a sub-sample was collected to be analyzed for stable isotopes of oxygen and hydrogen. Samples were collected every 3 months (March, June, September, and December) in order to assess the seasonal variability of the average isotopic composition of precipitation. Table 1.

Within the dune field, it is reasonably clear that the White Sands (eolian accumulations of gypsum sand) extend, broadly speaking, to a depth of 20 to 30 feet below interdune areas. The observation wells WS-007, WS-008, and WS-012, which are completed to the bottom of the gypsum sand, are 25.3, 24.9, and 26.1 feet deep respectively. The thickness of the gypsum decreases to the east and is very shallow (~10 feet) at the eastern edge of the dune field. The material that makes up the dune field is pri- marily fine to medium gypsum sand with some thin clay and silt laminations. Older deposits beneath the sand dunes and immediately to the east of the dunes consist of a mix of interbedded alluvial, eolian, and wetland deposits, of Pleistocene and Holocene age, which create a complex hydro- geologic framework of more permeable and less permeable (confining) beds. We installed two shallow piezometers, a little more than twelve feet deep, just to the east of the dune field a short distance south of the visitor center (WS-002 (Figure 13) and WS-003). These holes encountered about five feet of loose silty sand and mud beneath the surface, which we interpret to represent relatively young (mid-late Holocene) loess and alluvium. Below that the deposits are more compact, and con- sist of thinly interbedded layers of clay and silty to sandy clay, which we interpret as older (Pleistocene-early Holocene) alluvial basin-fill.

Sediments recovered from this hole were loose eolian gypsum sand. It is obvious that many more shallow monitoring wells in immediately adjacent dune-top/dune-base areas would be desirable in order to confirm this pattern. From November 28 through December 2, 2011 the US Geological Survey (USGS) drilled and completed two 195-foot water wells (WS-017 and WS-018) on the northeast side of the loop drive near pre-existing shallow monitoring well WS-007 (Figure 12). The newly constructed wells were used to conduct an aquifer test, which will be discussed later in this report. A schematic diagram of the well construction is shown in Figure 14. Borehole cuttings were collected at five-foot intervals during drilling of the monitoring well and are presently being stored by the New Mexico Bureau of Geology and Mineral Resources (NMBGMR), New Mexico Tech. A brief sum- mary of lithologies underlying the study site based on field examination of the recovered cores and cuttings is provided in Figure 14. Deposits below a depth of about 25 feet con- sist of interbedded to interlaminated clay and silty fine gypsum sand. Clay beds in the interval below ~25 feet commonly contain an abundance of coarse, secondary selenite crystals. Beneath 105 feet, the stratigraphic succession contains a relatively large proportion of clay and thin, siliciclastic silty sand interbeds. Although these wells provide an assessment of the stratigraphy beneath the eolian gypsum sand at just one point, they are an example of the types of sediments that are consistent with deposition environments described above. Hydrology Precipitation T he average annual precipitation on WHSA is approximately eight inches per year, much of which is due to summer thunderstorms. Figure 14.

The thirty year averages were calculated from data collected at a weather station at WHSA that is part of the National Weather Service (NWS) Cooperative Network (COOP 299686) (www.wrcc.dri.edu/cgi-bin/ cliMAIN.pl?nm9686). It can be seen that precipitation amounts can vary greatly from month to month and from year to year. In general, the majority of the annual precipita- tion occurs during the summer monsoon season (July-September). Surface water There is very little perennial surface water on the monument. As described above, there is a small reach of Lost River within the sand dunes that has water year round (Figure 7). This water appears to be regional groundwater, as it is very saline and flows extremely slowly due to an almost flat gradient. Another perennial surface water body on the study area is Garton Pond, which is located approximately one mile southeast of the WHSA visitor center. Garton Pond, covering approxi- mately two acres, is the result of the drilling of an oil exploration well in 1916 when the artesian flow of water from approximately 890 feet below the surface was initiated. Attempts to plug the well were unsuccessful. The initial flow rate and water temperature were 1,100 gallons per minute and 94 \u00b0F respectively. The water was allowed to flow into a shallow pond and surrounding marsh (Sprester, 1980) and was subsequently used by the NPS for recreation and educational purposes. The flow rate and water temperature gradually decreased with time. By 1980, the flow rate was estimated to be less than ten gallons per minute and the water tempera- ture was approximately 75 \u00b0F. Today, Garton Pond is a large marsh with little standing water.

Another perennial surface water body on the study area is Garton Pond, which is located approximately one mile southeast of the WHSA visitor center. Garton Pond, covering approxi- mately two acres, is the result of the drilling of an oil exploration well in 1916 when the artesian flow of water from approximately 890 feet below the surface was initiated. Attempts to plug the well were unsuccessful. The initial flow rate and water temperature were 1,100 gallons per minute and 94 \u00b0F respectively. The water was allowed to flow into a shallow pond and surrounding marsh (Sprester, 1980) and was subsequently used by the NPS for recreation and educational purposes. The flow rate and water temperature gradually decreased with time. By 1980, the flow rate was estimated to be less than ten gallons per minute and the water tempera- ture was approximately 75 \u00b0F. Today, Garton Pond is a large marsh with little standing water. The WHSA monitoring well WS-014 is located very close to Garton Pond. On the northeastern corner of the monu- ment, Salt Spring is a small depression filled with highly saline water and is home to the White Sands Pup Fish.

Another spring identified on older maps is located on the eastern edge of the dunes near a large cottonwood tree. This spring, which appeared to discharge from the toe of the dune, no longer exists. Monitoring well WS-003 is located very close to this extinct spring. There are several ephemeral surface water bodies on the monument. Lake Lucero is an active playa that fills with water (Figure 16) after large rain events in the San Andres Mountains. There are also several playas that fill up due to flash floods in Lost River to the east. Other playas appear to respond more to rising ground- water levels rather than surface runoff. The depth to groundwater is very shallow in the dune field and it is common for groundwater level increases to result in flooding of the interdunal areas (Figure 17). This flooding of interdunal areas generally occurs during the monsoon sea- son after heavy rains or during the winter, when evaporation rates are low. Rising groundwater levels in the dunes also occasionally results in springs that discharge from the western edge of the dune field. This water usually flows into Lake Lucero (Pers. Comm., David Bustos, 2012). Groundwater Figure 18 shows the location of observation wells, which were used to measure water-levels and collect groundwater samples for chemical analyses. Occurrence of groundwater Within the study area groundwater is very shal- low (1\u201320 feet below the surface). To the east of the dune field, groundwater is observed in the alluvial and wetland basin-fill deposits that can be seen in the well log for WS-002 (Figure 13). These deposits consist of mostly low permeability clays and silt beds of slightly higher permeability. As will be discussed below, this shallow groundwater to the east of the dune field is hydraulically connected to the shallow Figure 16. Lake Lucero flooded (Photograph by David Bustos).

All obser- vation wells located outside of the dune field, which were sampled for this study are less than thirty feet deep. Therefore, water-levels measured and water samples collected from these wells are likely characteristic of a shallow hydrologic system, and the degree to which it is connected to the deeper regional system is unclear. However, it should be noted that the well located near Garton Pond (WS-014, Figure 18) may produce groundwater of deeper origin that has migrated upwards along flow paths associated with the original oil explora- tion well that allowed deep warm water to reach the surface, as described in the above section on surface water in the study area. Within the dune field, groundwater is observed in the gypsum sand which sits above clay and silt basin-fill deposits (Figure 14). The thickness of the gypsum sand varies and is generally thickest in the center of the dune field where there can be as much as thirty feet of accumulated sand in the interdunal area. Figure 18. Location of observation wells . Figure 17. Picnic area flooded in 2006 (Photograph by David Bustos). 23 W h i t e S a n d s needed to assess groundwater flow conditions in Alkali Flat. Hydraulic gradients It can be seen in Figure 11 that the regional hydraulic gradient is to the south and west, indi- cating that on a regional scale, groundwater flows from the north and the Sacramento Mountains in the east to the south and west. Although there is certainly some groundwater flowing to the east from the San Andres Mountains, we do not have observation wells in locations to show these groundwater flow paths. Groundwater levels measured in monitoring wells across the study area (Figure 19) also show a general hydraulic gradient to the west with water-level elevations being greater in the east (east of the dune field) and lower to the west (Alkali Flats). Figure 19 also shows the surface elevation at each well, and it can be seen that to the east of the dune field, the depth to water is greater than that in other areas in the monument. The occurrence of groundwater in Alkali Flat is not well known because there are very few observation wells in this area. At the northern boundary of the monument and the western edge of the dune field, near WS-015, water is com- monly observed at the surface, while the depth to water in WS-015 is usually approximately one foot below the ground surface. A few hun- dred feet to the west, where the surface elevation is lower, depth to groundwater is greater than ten feet (Pers. Comm., Dave Love, 2013). The depth to water in WS-019, which is also near the boundary between the dune field and Alkali Flat, fluctuates between half a foot and two feet below the surface. To the south and west near Lake Lucero, depth to groundwater is less than two feet. The landscape on Alkali Flat drops in elevation from east to west in a step-like fashion, where flat surfaces that resemble terraces are likely due to the presence of clay layers at the surface.

Groundwater level elevations as a function of UTM easting values show a hydraulic gradient to the west, similar to that observed in the regional hydrologic system in the Tularosa Basin.

It can be seen that at this location, there appears to be a local gradient to the east with a higher water- level elevation in the dunes, which is opposite to that observed for the overall gradient observed across the study area. Within the dune field, the hydraulic gradient is to the west. It should also be noted that this was the only location where this local gradient was measured directly due to the locations and limited number of observation wells. However, electrical resis- tance surveys in two locations along transects that cross the eastern edged of the dune field, one near WS-002 and one near WS-009 indicate relatively fresh water flows from the dunes to shallow basin-fill sediments to the east and north (see Appendix A) The vertical hydraulic gradient was assessed by observing groundwater levels in WS-018 and WS-007. WS-018 penetrates the gypsum sand (approximately thirty feet thick) to a total depth of 200 feet. The screen interval is between 150 and 200 feet deep. WS-007 extends to the bottom of the gypsum sand, approximately thirty feet below the surface, and is screened along the entire saturated zone. The depth to water in both of these wells is very shallow (less than three feet below the surface). There appears to be no significant difference between water-level elevations in these two wells, indicat- ing no vertical hydraulic gradient in this area. It should be noted that the vertical gradient was examined in only one area, and vertical gradients may exist in other areas in the dune field. Water-level fluctuations Figure 21 shows depth to water below the ground surface for wells located on the eastern edge of the dune field (A), wells within the dune field (B), wells west of the dune field (Alkali Flat) and near Lake Lucero (C), and daily precipita- tion (D). The depths to water in wells to the west and within the dune field are significantly shallower that those in wells located to the east of the dune field. Groundwater hydrographs in wells within the dune field (Figure 21B) show two different trends: 1) short-term responses to individual storm events, where groundwater levels increase by less than a foot and then Figure 20. Groundwater levels (blue solid and dashed lines) in the dunes at the eastern edge of the dune field are higher than those in the basin-fill sediments adjacent to the dune field, resulting in a local hydraulic gradient to the east. 4,000 4,010 3,990 3,980 3,970 3,960 Elev ftB B\u2019 mixed loess and alluvium alluvial and wetland basin-fill deposits gypsum silt and sand 3,982 feet 1,214 meter 4002 feet 1220 meter WS-002 WS-003 WS-006 Edge of Dune Vertical exaggeration = 4x 25 W h i t e S a n d s decrease to previous levels within hours to days and 2) long-term fluctuations where groundwa- ter levels increase by one foot or more and then decrease to previous levels over several months (Figure 22).

Groundwater levels then gradually decrease to levels observed in June 2010 by July 2011. Groundwater hydrographs in most wells east and west of the dune field exhibit long-term fluctuations only. Hydrographs for wells WS-011 and WS-014 show a three to four month lag time between the onset of the long-term fluctuations observed in wells within the dune field and long-term fluctuations observed in these wells. These trends show interactions between the shallow hydrologic system within the dune field and the shallow systems adjacent to the dunes. These interactions are shown in Figure 23. During time periods of little or no rain, the shal- low systems within and outside of the dune field are essentially in equilibrium, exhibiting simi- lar water-level elevations with a slight gradient towards the west. Groundwater is discharging by evaporation within and outside the dune field throughout the study area. During the monsoon season groundwater recharge appears to occur primarily in the dune field as precipitation quickly infiltrates through the highly permeable sand, resulting in the short-term fluctuations observed in hydrographs in wells within the dune field. The recession limbs of these short-term responses are due to water draining from the shallow system in the dune field to adjacent shal- low aquifers to the east and west. As monsoon storms continue to recharge groundwater in the dune field and then drain into adjacent shallow aquifers, shallow groundwater levels in the dune field and adjacent aquifers increase, resulting in the rising limb of the long-term hydrographs. After monsoon rains subside, groundwater levels within and outside the dune field decrease gradually due to evaporation. The one well, whose hydrograph does not necessarily conform to these trends described Figure 22. Illustration of short-term groundwater level fluctuations (1) that are responses to individual precipitation events. The recession curves of these short-term fluctuations are due to the draining of groundwater in the dune field into adjacent shallow groundwater systems. Long-term fluctua- tions (2) are due to the gradual filling of the shallow aquifers in the dune field and adjacent aquifers to the east and west and subsequent water-level decreases due to evaporation.

While some water-level fluctuations in this well correlate with long term fluctuations in other wells, other changes in water-level appear to be unrelated to recharge events within the dune field. For example, the water-level increase that begins in January 2001 does not correlate to changes in water-levels observed in any other wells in the study area. Most other wells show a general decline in water-levels during this same time period. These observations suggest that ground- water near Lake Lucero may be responding to a different or more regional hydrologic regime. Infiltration through gypsum sand dunes Tensiometer depths and matric potential data were used to calculate total head gradients at different depth intervals at tensiometer sites (WS-401 and WS-402). SM-401 is a group of four tensiometers that are installed at the approximate depths of one foot, three feet, five feet and nine feet at the crest of a dune. WS-401 is a group of two tensiometers that are installed at the approximate depths of one foot and three feet at the toe of the stoss side of a dune (Figure 24). Matric potential measurements are shown in Figure 25 for the top of the dune (A) and the toe of the dune (B), along with precipitation Figure 23. Water-level fluctuations represent interactions between the shallow groundwater system within the dune field and adjacent shallow systems to the east and west of the dune field. Increases in water-levels within the dune field (A) are due to infiltration of monsoon rains through the gypsum sand into the shallow groundwater system. Recession curves for these short-term fluctuations are due to water draining from the dune field aquifer into adjacent shallow systems. For the long-term fluctuations ( B) increases in groundwater level are due to the accumulation of recharge from the dune field over the monsoon season. The recession curve for the long-term fluctuations is due to evaporation of groundwater through the shallow unsaturated zone.

For the top of the dune, matric potential at an approximate depth of 1 foot shows much larger fluctuations than observed at other depths. It can be seen that dur- ing the typical dry period (between March and July) the matric potential at this shallow depth decreases significantly. This decrease is most obvious during the months of June and July 2011, where matric potential values get down to -15 feet of water. This decrease in matric poten- tial values is due to the removal of moisture from the sand due to evaporation. The onset of the monsoon season in late July results in the almost immediate increase to the approximate value of -2 feet of water. Although matric potential is most responsive to precipitation events at the shallowest depth, increases in matric potential values that are due to precipitation events can be seen at all depths. These increases are due to an increase in water content at that depth. It is interesting that at depths of 3 feet and deeper, matric potential values are relatively constant over time and average about -2 feet of water. This value is within the range of typical values for field capacity in fine to medium sands (Wierenga, 1995). Field capacity refers to the amount of water an unsaturated medium can retain against the pull of gravity. Therefore, if a known amount of water is added to a soil that is at field capacity, that same amount of water will drain downward due to gravity. It appears that field capacity is maintained in the dunes at depths greater 3 feet below the sur- face. Therefore, the volumetric water content in the unsaturated zone within the dune is relatively constant with time. This assessment is reasonable given that in the area where the experiment is being done, there is little or no vegetation to extract water from the sand. Furthermore, redistribution of unsaturated zone water due to evaporation and condensation resulting from subsurface temperature fluctua- tions is likely minimal. Figure 26 shows air temperature along with the temperature approximately six inches below the surface. It can be seen that diurnal temperature fluctuations are greatly attenuated just a few inches below the surface. Temperature fluctuations are surely even more attenuated at greater depths. This observed high attenuation of temperature fluctuations in the subsurface is probably due to the high albedo of the white sand, resulting in much of the sensible heat to be reflected back into the atmosphere. For the tensiometers at the toe of the dune (WS-402) (Figure 25B), again, large fluctuations in matric potential are observed at the shallowest depth of 1 foot. During the dry period before the monsoon season, values at this depth get as low as -9 feet of water due to evaporation of water in the sand. Rapid responses to precipita- tion events (precipitation data was not available for the early time period shown) is observed, and, as was observed at the top of the dune, upon the onset of the monsoon season in 2010, matric potential increased to an average value of about -2 feet of water, indicating that the sand is at field capacity at that depth. At 3 feet below the surface, matric potential values are signifi- cantly higher than -2 feet of water. These high values are a result of the tip of the tensiometer being just above the water table, where water is pulled up by capillary action, increasing the water content. Groundwater flows from high total head to low total head. The total head in the unsaturated zone at any point is the sum of matric potential (pressure head) and the gravitational poten- tial (elevation head).

Therefore, gravitational potential is the dominant potential energy that drives water flow in the unsaturated zone within the dune. Figure 27A shows hydraulic gradients at different depth intervals. Positive gradients indicate downward flow, and negative gradients indicate upward flow. At depths below three feet, hydraulic gradients are always downward, and generally approach the value of one, which indicates gravity drainage. The hydraulic gradi- ent between approximate depths of one and three feet is upwards during time periods with little or no rain, as a result of evaporation of water in the shallow sand. Almost immediately after monsoons begin, the shallow hydrau- lic gradient changes to a downward gradient, due to the infiltration of local precipitation. Tensiometers installed at the toe of the dune (Figure 27B) show similar trends between one and three feet. Tensiometer data clearly indicate the dune field is a recharge zone. On the top of dunes, there can be up to fifteen or twenty feet of unsat- urated sand above the water table. Within this unsaturated zone, hydraulic gradients are domi- nated by gravitational potential (downward). It appears that the volumetric water content at depths greater than three feet below the surface, are fairly constant and close to field capacity. Between the depths of one and three feet, the hydraulic gradient is upward due to evaporation during the dry season but then quickly changes to downward when the monsoon season begins. Because the unsaturated zone appears to main- tain field capacity, infiltration of precipitation at the surface quickly flushes water into the shallow aquifer system, resulting in the short term fluctu- ations observed in the groundwater hydrographs in the dune field discussed above. At the toe of the dunes and within the inter- dunes, the unsaturated zone is much shallower (one to three feet). Evaporation during the dry Figure 26.

Thin crusts observed in these areas also indicate evaporation of shallow groundwa- ter. Again, during the rainy season, hydraulic gradients are downward, which is consistent with local precipitation recharging the shallow aquifer. Geochemistry S amples were collected from eleven wells and one surface water location along Lost River within the monument (Figure 28, Table 2). Samples were analyzed for general chemistry, trace metals, stable isotopes of hydrogen and oxygen, tritium, tritium-helium, Carbon-14, and CFCs. In this section we will describe geochemi- cal data and interpretations. Field parameters The field parameters of pH, specific conductance (SC), temperature (T), and dissolved oxygen (DO) were measured in the field during sam- pling (Table 3). Measured pH values for most water samples ranged between 7.1 and 7.7. The groundwater sample collected from WS-023, a well near Lake Lucero, and the surface water sample from Lost River (WS-201) had pHs of 6.73 and 8.21 respectively. SC values ranged from 2,404 to 153,894 \u03bcS/cm. The lowest value was observed for water collected from a well installed on the top a dune (WS-006). The sample from WS-005, which is also located on a dune top, exhibits a relatively low SC value. The SC value for WS-007, which is installed in an interdune near WS-005 and completed in the shallow gypsum sand aquifer, was 14,080 \u03bcS/cm in May 2010, and 12,691 \u03bcS/cm in December 2010. WS-018 is completed in the basin-fill directly beneath WS-007 and exhibits a sig- nificantly larger SC value over 50,000 \u03bcS/cm. Samples collected from WS-009 and WS-011, which are completed in basin-fill sediments just to the east of the dune field and are approxi- mately twenty to thirty feet deep, had relatively lower SC values, similar to groundwater beneath the tops of dunes (4,193 and 3,735 \u03bcS/cm respectively). WS-014, which is located a couple miles east of the dune field near Garton Pond has a SC value of 11,728 \u03bcS/cm. Groundwater near Lake Lucero exhibited the highest SC value (153,894 \u03bcS/cm). Groundwater temperatures ranged from 14.39 to 22.31 \u00b0C, with the highest temperature being observed in WS-014, near Garton Pond.

The next highest temperature was observed in WS-023, near Lake Lucero. DO values for groundwater were highly variable, ranging from 0.01 to 7.27 mg/L. The observed spatial variability for SC values indicates that, within the dune field, fresher water is found directly beneath the dunes, while groundwater in interdunal areas is generally higher in total dissolved solids (TDS). Groundwater in the deeper basin-fill sediments beneath the gypsum sand apparently has higher TDS than all groundwater in the shallow dune field aquifer. Shallow groundwater just east of the dune field exhibits SC values closer to those observed beneath the dunes, suggesting that fresh local recharge from the dunes is flowing into the shallow groundwater system to the east, which is consistent with observed local hydraulic gradi- ents discussed above. The intermediate SC value and high temperature observed in WS-014 (near Garton Pond) may indicate that water is flow- ing upward from depth as discussed above, and Figure 28. Location of sites that were sampled for geochemical analyses. 33 W h i t e S a n d s therefore, this water may represent a regional groundwater component. The high SC value observed for WS-023 (near Lake Lucero) indi- cates a high TDS value, which may be indicative of a regional groundwater component. The high temperature is probably just due to the shallow depth to water and represents the average annual air temperature in the area. General Chemistry Water samples were analyzed for general chemistry, which includes the major ions of calcium (Ca2+), magnesium (Mg2+), sodium (Na+), bicarbonate (HCO3-), sulfate (SO4 2-), and chloride (Cl-). The relative chemical composition with respect to these ions, observed spatial variability in water chemistry, and interpreta- tions are presented in this section below. Total dissolved solids (TDS) values ranged from 2,323 to 256,922 mg/L. Figure 29 shows the spatial distribution for TDS values. Interestingly, as observed for SC values, the lowest values were found in wells completed in the shallow gypsum sand aquifer and installed at the top of a dune (WS-005 and WS-006). WS-007, which is located in an interdunal area near WS-005 exhibited a TDS value of over 10,000 mg/L, and WS-018, which is located approximately twelve feet from WS-007 but completed in the basin- fill sediments well below the gypsum sand at approximately 200 feet below the surface, shows a TDS value of 39,000 mg/L. Most observation wells located near the edge of the dune field, both to the east and west had TDS values of less than 5,000 mg/L, with the exception of WS-002, which is completed at a shallower depth than other wells that were sampled along the edge of the dune field. WS-014 has a TDS value of 8,498 mg/L. The highest TDS values were observed in the Lost River and groundwa- ter sampled near Lake Lucero (74,341 mg/L and 256,922 mg/L respectively).

All water samples have small relative HCO3 concentrations. SO4 is the dominant anion for water samples collected from wells on dune tops, in basin-fill sediments just to the east and west of the dune field. Water sampled from the shallow gypsum sand aquifer in interdune areas, near Lake Lucero and Lost River were observed to contain similar relative concentrations for SO4 and Cl. Cl was the dominant anion for ground- water in basin-fill beneath the dune field. The water sample that plots at the top corner of the diamond section of the piper diagram was collected from WS-006, located on the top of a dune at the eastern edge of the dune field. This well also produced the lowest TDS value. The water chemistry for this sample is primarily controlled by the dissolution of gypsum sand (Ca-SO4 water type) and represents the local recharge component that originates as precipita- tion in the dune field. Water samples collected near Garton Pond (WS-014), at Lost River (WS-201), near Lake Lucero (WS-023) and in the basin-fill sediments below the gypsum sand (WS-018) have higher TDS values and have higher relative abundances of sodium and chloride (Na-Cl water type). The water chemistry of these water samples is prob- ably due to other geochemical processes, not just the dissolution of minerals, such as cation exchange, and evaporation. These water samples likely represent some regional component. All other water samples plot between these two water types (local recharge component and regional component). The specific processes that control the water chemistry will be discussed below. Figure 29. Spatial distribution of TDS values. 35 W h i t e S a n d s Controls on water chemistry The general chemistry data discussed above shows two discrete chemical signatures; lower TDS Ca-SO4 water and a high TDS Na-Cl water. Geochemical modeling was used to determine the mechanisms that control the observed water chemistry. Figure 31 shows the ratio of Ca/SO4 as a function of SO4 concentration for all water samples along with models calculated for mixing and evaporation. WS-006 (top of dune near the eastern edge of the dune field) shows a Ca/SO4 ratio similar to that of the mineral gypsum (~0.42), which would be expected for water that has infiltrated through gypsum sand. The mixing model represents the mixing of the two apparent end members, WS-006 (top of dune in Heart of Dunes) and WS-023 (near Lake Lucero). The evaporation curve models the Figure 30.

Groundwater samples collected at the High Energy Laser System Test Facility (HELSTF) (Basabilvazo et al., 1994), approximately five miles south of the monument, at various depths up to 800 feet below the surface, are chemically similar to the four samples identified as regional groundwa- ter (WS-014, WS-023, WS-201, WS-018).

The fact that water sampled from WS-018 (basin-fill sediments below the gypsum sand) does not plot on the mixing curve just means that groundwater in that area that resides between 150 and 200 feet below ground does not enter the shallow aquifer system in the gypsum sand that lies above. The regional component that mixes with local recharge in the shallow aquifer in the dune field is probably best characterized by WS-014 (near Garton Pond).

Well cuttings from WS-017 and WS-018 show that basin-fill sediments below the gypsum sand contain signifi- cant amounts of gypsum, which would explain the relatively high Ca/SO4 ratio. The high clay content in the deeper basin-fill sediments and absence of a vertical gradient in this area also suggests that water from the deeper system is not flowing into the shallow system at this location. More research is necessary to understand where regional groundwater is entering the shallow aquifer in the dune field. Stable Isotopes of Hydrogen and Oxygen Figure 32 shows stable isotope data plotted as \u03b4D vs. \u03b418O. The data include stable isotopic compositions for local precipitation samples. Two of the precipitation samples plot very close to the global meteoric water line (GMWL), while the other shows evidence of being evaporated. It is not uncommon for precipitation in arid areas to exhibit an evaporative isotopic signa- ture. During light rain storms, rain drops evapo- rate as they fall to the ground. The groundwater samples are grouped by geographic location. It can be seen that ground- water collected from the well near Garton Pond (WS-014) plots on the GMWL, and therefore shows no sign of evaporation. This water likely represents regional groundwater that originated as precipitation in the Sacramento Mountains thousands of years ago. The isotopic composi- tions of water from Lost River and groundwater from near Lake Lucero can be explained by the evaporation of this regional ground water. The isotopic compositions of groundwater from the eastern edge of the dunes, within the dune field, and on Alkali Flats plot on the evaporation line or between the evaporation line and the GMWL.

Stable isotope data for all water samples suggest the isotope composition of Lost River, and groundwater near Lake Lucero can be explained purely as a result of evaporation of groundwater near Garton Pond (regional groundwater). The isotopic composition of all other water samples can be explained by evaporation of this regional component to a certain extent along with mixing of local recharge that occurs in the dune field. -100 -50 -40 -30 -20 -10 0 -90 -80 -70 -60 -11 -9 -7 -5 -3 -1 1 3 \u03b4D (\u2030) \u03b418O (\u2030) GMWL Precipitation Lake Lucero Alkali flats Dune field Eastern edge of dunes Lost River Garton Pond Lost River Lake Lucero Near Garton Pond Evaporation Mixing N E W M E X I C O B U R E A U O F G E O L O G Y A N D M I N E R A L R E S O U R C E S 38 and the GMWL can be explained by the mixing of evaporated regional groundwater with local precipitation that infiltrates through the dunes.

Groundwater Age and Residence Time T he residence time of groundwater is often inferred from its \u201cisotopic age,\u201d based on interpretation of environmental tracers such as tritium (3H), chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), or carbon-14 (14C). The isotopic age relates to the time elapsed between groundwater recharge and collection of a sample at a discharge point such as a well or spring (Mazor and Nativ, 1992). Tracer ages may also be influenced by mixing of groundwater from multiple sources, water-mineral interactions, and groundwater- atmosphere interactions. Therefore, it is advan- tageous to use several different environmental tracers to estimate groundwater residence time. In this section, we present results and interpreta- tions for environmental tracer analyses. Tritium Precipitation samples were not tested for tri- tium for this study. Newton et al.

(2012) found tritium levels in precipitation in the nearby Sacramento Mountains to range from 3 to 10 TU, reflecting typical seasonal variations, which gives an idea for the range of values that repre- sent \u201cmodern\u201d precipitation. Tritium concentrations in well samples from the study area ranged from 0.09 to 4.63 TU (Figure 33, Table 5). Most samples collected from wells near the eastern edged of the dune field, within the dune field, and just west of the dune field, are observed to have tritium Figure 33. Tritium values for water samples show \u201cmodern\u201d precipitation values for most locations. 39 W h i t e S a n d s concentrations between 3 and 5 TU. These tritium values likely reflect a mixture of modern and older waters, which is consistent with interpretations of hydrologic and geochemical data presented in previous sections. Local pre- cipitation infiltrates through the dunes and mixes with an older regional groundwater component. The only exception to this trend is WS-009, which has a tritium concentration of 0.09 TU, indicating a mixture of largely older water and a small component of modern water. This observa- tion is interesting because it is inconsistent with water chemistry data, which suggests that this well taps relatively low TDS water that comes from the near-by dune field. Samples collected from WS-014 (near Garton Pond) and WS-023 (near Lake Lucero) also show tritium values much less than 1 TU, reflecting mostly older water, with a small component of modern water. These data support ion chemistry data that sug- gests that these waters represent the regional component. The water sample collected from Lost River (WS-201) exhibits a tritium value of 4.42 TU, which appears to be higher than expected, based on ion water chemistry and isotope data that identifies this water as regional groundwater. It is likely that exposure to the atmosphere has resulted with partial re-equilibration with atmospheric tritium. For most other age dating methods, such as carbon-14 and CFCs, the concentration of the environmental tracer of interest is controlled by the partial pressure of a gas in the atmosphere or unsaturated soil at the time of recharge. Therefore, exposure of the water to the atmosphere at a spring or stream usually increases uncertainty in the estimated age due to re-equilibration with gases in the atmosphere. Tritium is more stable because it is part of the water molecule. However, given enough time, tritium concentrations in surface water will be controlled by tritium levels in water vapor in the atmosphere. The large evaporative isotopic signature observed for this sample suggests that water in the Lost River is exposed to the atmosphere for an extended period of time. The reach of Lost River that is in the study area is characterized by a very flat gradient, and it is difficult to visually observe movement of water in this stream. Therefore, it is likely that 4.42 TU is an over-estimate of the age of the water. Tritium-Helium / Noble Gases Noble gas analyses were performed on 5 groundwater sample locations within the study area and were used to derive tritium-helium (3H/3He) groundwater ages, which vary from 2.4 to greater than 50 years (Table 5). A sample with an age greater than 50 years indicates that the age is off the 3H/3He scale, and the true age Table 5.

All other water samples have R/Ra ratios significantly less than one, which is characteristic of older water that has accu- mulated 4He due to U/Th radioactive decay in the crust (Castro, 2004).

Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) Calculation of apparent age based on CFC concentrations in water samples is dependent on knowledge of the input recharge elevation and recharge temperature, with temperature being the more critical variable. Estimated recharge temperatures that are too cold will result in apparent CFC ages that are too old, while warmer estimated recharge temperatures will result in erroneously young apparent ages. Similarly, an overestimation of recharge elevation will result in apparent ages that are too young, and an underestimation of recharge elevation will produce erroneously old ages (Kazemi et al., 2006). For this study, because these parameters are unknown, recharge elevations were set to the elevations of the sample locations, and recharge temperatures were set to the temperatures of the water that was sampled. CFC-11 ages were not considered because of its greater potential for contamination and microbial degradation. Samples analyzed for chlorofluorocarbons have CFC12 ages ranging from 17.7 to 47.7 (Table 5). CFC113 ages are within seven years of the CFC- 12 estimates, and the CFC113/CFC12 ages are similar to the CFC113 ages for all samples ana- lyzed for CFCs, with the exception on WS-011, located at the eastern edge of the dune field. For this sample, the ratio age is younger than appar- ent age based on the concentration of CFC12 alone. Such a discrepancy between apparent and ratio ages usually implies that mixing of waters of different ages has occurred (Han et al., 2001; Plummer et al., 2006). Carbon \u2013 14 For the carbon-14 age estimates, it should be noted that these are apparent ages and have not been corrected for hydrogeologic processes, such as carbonate dissolution and exchange of carbon isotopes between the dissolved inorganic carbon and carbonate minerals. Judging by the water chemistry, and the old apparent ages, these processes have likely influenced carbon-14 concentrations. Almost all water samples are saturated or super saturated with respect to calcite, indicating that significant carbonate dissolution has taken place. Carbon that is derived from most carbonate rocks does not contain carbon-14. Therefore, carbonate dissolu- tion dilutes aqueous carbon-14 concentrations, making the water sample look older than it is. One method of correcting ages for carbonate dissolution uses 13C/12C ratios (\u03b413C). It can be seen in Table 5 that \u03b413C values range from -6.3 to -9.9 \u2030. These \u03b413C values are a result of the mixing of dissolved inorganic carbon derived by the dissolution of soil CO2 in the recharge area and carbonate derived by the dissolution of carbonate rocks in the phreatic system, as well as other geochemical processes, including matrix exchange and redox reactions (Clark and Fritz, 41 W h i t e S a n d s 1997). Without knowing recharge conditions such as the \u03b413C value of the soil CO2 in the recharge area, it is very difficult to correct car- bon-14 age estimates for these processes. We did attempt to correct carbon-14 age estimates using the measured \u03b413C values for dissolved inorganic carbon and assumed \u03b413C values for soil CO2 in the recharge area and for geologic carbonate, but could not yield reasonable estimates for all samples under the same assumptions. The range of apparent carbon-14 ages is large, and therefore these values can be used to assess relative ages amongst the water samples. As was observed for other age dating methods, the youngest apparent carbon-14 ages (360 and 390 YBP) were exhibited in water samples col- lected from the top of dunes (WS-005, WS-006) waters. Water sampled in the interdunal areas and slightly outside the dune field, both to the east and west, has older apparent carbon-14 ages that range from 860 to 3720 YBP. The two water samples that were chemically identified as representing regional groundwater, WS-014 and WS-023, exhibit the oldest apparent carbon-14 ages of 9,890 and 22,690 YBP respectively. Groundwater residence time The large range in apparent ages observed in the data described above is likely due to the range of ages that the different environmental tracers measure. For example, CFCs can only be used to date groundwater that has been recharged in the 1950s and after. Mixing of older CFC-free groundwater makes apparent CFC age estimates appear older but cannot provide an age estimate for the CFC-free water. Carbon-14, due to its relatively long half-life, is commonly used to esti- mate the age of groundwater that is much older (on the order of thousands of years). For the carbon-14 data presented above, apparent ages of the youngest samples (~300 YBP) represent mostly modern groundwater. Although the age estimates discussed above may not yield an actual groundwater age, the age estimates resulting from the different methodolo- gies show a common trend that is consistent with geochemical data discussed above. The youngest water is found in wells installed on top of dunes, indicating that local precipitation infiltrates through the sand dunes to recharge the shallow groundwater system. All other water samples appear to be older due to mixing with an older regional component. The R/Ra ratios (3He/4Hewater sample/3He/ 4Heatmosphere) show the same trend. Groundwater residing directly beneath the dunes exhibit R/ Ra ratios that indicate that the atmosphere is the main source of helium, which is consistent with a young water that represents local recharge. All other water samples, including shallow groundwater beneath interdunes, exhibit R/Ra ratios that are characteristic of older waters that have traveled along a flow path, acquiring geo- logic 4He. These R/Ra ratio data are consistent with other data discussed above that show that groundwater in the shallow groundwater system in the dune field is a result of mixing of young local recharge and an older regional component.

Aquifer Test in the Heart of the Dunes A n aquifer test was conducted beginning Thursday November 8 at 10:40 am and end- ing the morning of November 11. Water was pumped from WS-018, which is completed in basin-fill sediments below the gypsum sand that makes up the dune field (Figure 14, Figure 12). Water-level responses observed in this well and WS-017 (also completed in deeper basin-fill) were analyzed to estimate hydrologic parameters in this deeper aquifer system. Water-levels were also observed in WS-007, which is completed in the shallow aquifer in the gypsum sand. An observed water-level change in this shallow well due to pumping from WS-018 would show a hydraulic connection between the shallow groundwater system within the dune field and the deeper system that lies below the gypsum sand.

The pumping rate was initially set at approximately four gallons per minute, and adjustments were made during the test to try and maintain a constant flow rate. On Saturday morning, November 10, 2012, total drawdown in the pumping well was at about 140 feet, with only a ten foot water column above the pump. At this point, the flow rate was decreased to about three gallons per minute, which caused an increase in water-levels. Other abrupt changes in water-level fluctuations in WS-018 that are observed prior to the change in pumping rate correlate with times when the flow rate was adjusted. These adjustments were necessary because of the flow rate would decrease in a fairly abrupt manner, probably due to the dewatering of a more permeable sand unit. The pump was turned off on Sunday morn- ing, November 11, 2012, and we pulled the pump on Tuesday, November 13. No water level change was observed in WS-007 (shallow aquifer) during the test. Drawdown and recovery data were analyzed using AQTESOLV for windows (Duffield, 2007). Diagnostic analyses of these data can help to characterize hydrologic processes associated with water moving from the aquifer to the well bore and being discharged at the surface. Several different mathematical models exist that describe different flow regimes during an aquifer test. The equation solved by Papadopulos and Cooper (1967), which fits drawdown data well (Figure 35, Figure 36), applies to fully penetrating wells in a confined aquifer and accounts for wellbore storage. Figure 35 shows data, derivatives, and fitted curves for the pumping well (WS-018). Early time drawdown data show a linear trend with a slope close to one. Calculated deriva- tives, which are the change in drawdown with time, show a decrease close to the time when the Figure 34.

Hydraulic conductivity values were calculated assuming that the aquifer thickness was equal to the screened interval (50 feet). These values estimated from test data for the two different wells are similar. Hydraulic conductivity values are within the range of typi- cal values for silt or silty sand, and the storage coefficients are within the range of expected values for a confined aquifer. Results of this aquifer test show that the basin-fill sediments that lie directly below the dune field are characterized by a very low hydraulic conductivity. The large drawdown response to pumping at such low flow rates shows that these sediments do not convey water easily. It should be noted again that the water- level in WS-007, which is completed in the shallow dune field aquifer, showed no significant change during or after the test. We attempted to fit the drawdown and recovery data to mod- els that account for vertical leakage through an overlying confining bed with no success. It appears that the shallow dune aquifer system is effectively isolated from the deeper hydrologic system due to the low permeability sediments that exist directly below the gypsum sand. Water chemistry also supports this conclu- sion. Total TDS values for water pumped from the deeper system were significantly higher than groundwater collected in the shallow system within the dune field (Figure 29). Also, for water samples collected from WS-018 during the aquifer test, data do not plot on the mixing and evaporation curves shown on Figure 31, suggest- ing that the water chemistry observed for water collected from the deeper system is not necessar- ily controlled by the same processes that control water chemistry in the shallow system.

Although these different types of data characterized differ- ent processes within the hydrologic system, they complement each other, and the interpretations of these different data types largely tell the same story. This section will examine interpretations of these data and integrate them to develop a conceptual model of the shallow groundwater system in the dune field and how it interacts with the larger regional system. Water Sources that Contribute to Dune Aquifer System G roundwater level data, unsaturated zone characterization, water chemistry, groundwa- ter age data, and stable isotope data all strongly suggest that the dune field is a recharge zone. Water-levels within the dune field respond dra- matically to local individual precipitation events, while shallow water-levels just outside the dune field do not (Figure 21). Hydraulic gradients, in the unsaturated zone within a dune at depths I V . C o n c l u s i o n s greater than three feet, were observed to be relatively constant and in a downward direction (Figure 27). Water stored in the unsaturated zone within dunes is quickly flushed into the groundwater system due to the infiltration of local precipitation. Water chemistry data, including the major anions and cations, the stable isotopes of oxygen and hydrogen, and environmental isotopes that provide information about groundwater age, also show that most groundwater in the gypsum sand aquifer is a mixture of a local recharge component and a regional component. Again, the local component is derived from local precipitation and the regional component was likely derived from precipitation in the Sacramento Mountains. Table 7 shows how the different groundwater components are character- ized for the different data types. In general local recharge exhibits lower TDS values and dominant ions of Ca and SO4 due to the dissolution of the gypsum sand.

Groundwater samples within the dune field show a significant deviation from the evaporation line towards the GMWL, where summer precipitation typically plots (Figure 32). Therefore, the local groundwater compo- nent is derived from local summer precipitation. Groundwater age data shows a large range of ages, with the purest local recharge component having tritium levels above four tritium units and an apparent carbon-14 age of less than 500 years before present. The spatial variability of the data discussed above suggests that much of the recharge in the dune field occurs directly below the dunes, as opposed to interdunal areas. The youngest and lowest TDS waters were observed in wells located on top of dunes, while wells located in the interdunes produced water with a much larger proportion of the regional component. Resistivity data supports this interpretation (Appendix A). High resistivity values (fresher water) are observed directly beneath the dunes, while extremely low resistivity values are observed in interdunal areas (brackish water and brines). It should be noted that the results of this study indicate that regional groundwater makes up a much larger proportion of water in the shallow dune aquifer than local recharge. Aquifer-aquifer Interactions G eology, water-level data, and water chemistry, provide rationale for identifying the shallow groundwater system within the gypsum dune field as a single aquifer that is separate from the shallow groundwater systems to the east and west of the dune field and the system directly below the gypsum sand. Geologically, the dune field is defined by the relatively homogeneous accumulation of gypsum sand that can be up to thirty feet thick. This accumulation of sand gradually pinches out both to the east and west of the dune field. The shallow groundwater system to the east and west of the dune field, occurs in highly stratified basin-fill sediments, consisting of eolian, alluvial, and playa deposits. The boundary between the dune field and basin- fill sediments to the east is abrupt and quite vis- ible due to the color difference and topographic relief of the dunes (Figure 6). The nature of the western boundary between the shallow aquifers is not well characterized in terms of where the accumulation of gypsum sand ends and where the basin-fill sediments begin. However, a short distance to the west of the western most dunes, the elevation of Alkali Flat decreases in a step- wise fashion, indicating that the topography is likely controlled by the local stratigraphy. Groundwater level data reveal that at the eastern boundary of the dune field, the water table in the dunes is slightly higher than the water table in the basin-fill sediments just to the east (Figure 20). This water-level elevation difference represents a local hydraulic gradient to the east, which is different from the regional hydraulic gradient to the west. This local gra- dient indicates that groundwater flows from the dune field aquifer to the shallow aquifer system in the basin-fill sediments to the east. Groundwater level fluctuations in the study area, described above, indicate that water-level increases in the shallow system outside the dune field are due to interactions between the dune aquifer and the other shallow systems to the east and west (Figure 23). Local precipitation quickly recharges the dune aquifer, resulting in a rapid increase in water-levels in the dune field. This increase in hydraulic head causes water to drain to adjacent shallow aquifer systems, resulting in gradual water-level increases to the east and west of the dune field. Water chemistry and environmental tracer data also support the above interpretation. Groundwater with relatively low TDS values and younger ages, indicative of the local recharge component, were observed in shallow wells just outside the dune field (Figure 29). Resistivity data also show highly resistive fresh water flow- ing from the dunes down gradient into basin-fill sediments (see appendix A). It appears the shallow accumulation of gypsum sand at the eastern edge of the dune field W h i t e S a n d s 47 and the stratigraphy of the basin-fill sediments allows relative isolation of this fresher water along higher permeability layers. Interestingly, most archeological sites are located near the eastern dune field boundary where fresher water was likely accessible. Stratigraphic control on groundwater flow can also be observed to the west of the dune field. WS-015 shows the water table to be at approximately one and a half feet below the surface. However, this area often has standing water at the surface perched on top of a low permeability layer. This surface water and water produced from the well is relatively fresh, indicating that it is largely local recharge from the dunes, and is flowing laterally along playa sediments in Alkali Flat. Farther to the west, depth to water is highly variable and may be greater than ten feet below the surface in some areas, demonstrating the existence of localized perched aquifers throughout this area. In con- trast, local recharge that occurs in the center of the dune field, where accumulation sand can be up to thirty feet thick, there is no stratigraphy to focus the flow of this fresher water. Therefore, it just slowly mixes with higher TDS regional groundwater. Interactions between the shallow dune aquifer and the deeper regional system was investigated with an aquifer test, where water was continuously pumped from WS-018 for approximately three days. Water-levels in the pumping well and observation wells (WS-017, WS-007) were observed during pumping and the recovery period. Although there was significant drawdown in the deeper system that was being pumped (WS-017, WS-018), no drawdown was observed in the shallow aquifer (WS-007).

Aquifer test data show no evidence of leakage from the shallow system into the deeper system under the conditions of the test. The low perme- ability playa deposits that lie below the gypsum sand effectively limit interactions between the shallow and deeper hydrologic systems. It should be noted that, although the shal- low system does appear to be relatively isolated from the regional system, results from this study indicate the presence of an older regional component. This observation suggests that the shallow dune aquifer does interact with the regional system, probably on a much larger time scale than was represented for the aquifer test. This regional groundwater component probably enters the shallow groundwater system in the dune field from the east and localized areas from below. More research is needed to determine how and where the regional component is enter- ing the shallow gypsum sand aquifer system. Hydrogeologic Conceptual Model F igure 37 shows a conceptual hydrogeologic model along the cross-section A-A\u2019 (Figure 8). It should be noted that the vertical exaggeration is approximately 134x. This large vertical exag- geration is necessary to show the shallow system, which we are interested in. It could be seen that the shallow water table in the dune field is very shallow and slightly higher than the water table to the east of the dune field. The black arrows show the direction of groundwater movement. Local recharge occurs in the dune field as precipi- tation infiltrates through the high permeability sand. A regional component enters the dune field aquifer from the east and possibly north and from greater depths. Groundwater discharge primar- ily occurs as evaporation from the shallow water table through the unsaturated sediments. 3,880 3,890 3,900 3,910 3,920 3,930 3,940 3,950 3,960 3,970 3,980 3,990 4,000 0 10,000 20,000 30,000 40,000 50,000 60,000 70,000 80,000 90,000 Jarilla Fault ?

The use of multiple data types strengthens the interpretations and conclusions that have been drawn about the hydrologic system in the study area. However, the study area (WHSA) represents a very small proportion of the gypsum dune field. It would be very helpful to look at groundwater flow conditions throughout the entire dune field. As mentioned above, when considering regional groundwater flow and how the regional system interacts with the shallow dune aquifer, the effect of the Jarilla Fault on groundwater flow cannot be ignored. However, accurate characterization of this large fault in terms of the regional hydrogeologic framework is a very difficult task. Currently, the exact location of this structure is not known. The Jarilla Fault is denoted on geologic maps as a dashed line to show it\u2019s approximate location. As a part of this study, the NPS provided some funding for geophysical investigations to locate the Jarilla V . f u t u r e w o r k Fault within and near the study area. These investigations include electrical resistivity surveys (Appendix B) and seismic surveys (Appendix C). The fault was located by both methods just east of the WHSA Visitor\u2019s Center. The fault was easily located here due to the presence of exposed bedrock near the water tower on the east side of Highway 70. Efforts were also made to locate the fault near the north WHSA bound- ary, but the results were more ambiguous indicating a spatially complex fault zone. It would be worth the effort to conduct more geophysical surveys to improve our understand- ing of this important structure. We are currently in the process of using mathematical modeling approaches to estimate the volume of regional groundwater that makes its way into the shallow dune groundwater system and to assess the timescale on which changes in regional water-levels will affect water- levels in the shallow aquifer in the dune field. Much of the data described in this report is being used to calibrate these models.

The purpose of these surveys was to characterize the local and sub-regional hydrology of the dune fields and adjacent areas within the Monument, and their relationship to regional hydrologic conditions in the Tularosa Basin. This report provides a brief description of the results of this work. The basic operating principal for electrical resistivity surveys involves generating a direct current between two metal electrodes implanted in the ground, while the ground voltage is measured between two additional implanted electrodes. Given the current flow and measured voltage drop between two electrodes, the subsurface resistivity between the electrodes can be determined and mapped. Results of ER surveys are based on a com- puter-generated inverse model of measurements made in the field, and are referred to as the apparent resistivity. Resistivity profiles detect vertical and lateral variations in resistivity in the subsurface. The presence of water or water-saturated soil or bedrock will strongly affect the results of a resistivity survey. Saltwater and brine have very low resistivity, ranging from <1 to a few tens of ohm-meters. Fresh water will show a much higher apparent resistivity, up to several thousand ohm-meters depending on dissolved solids content. Brackish water will display a spectrum of apparent resistivity values ranging from brine to pure water. Air-filled pore space in sediment above the water table will also have very high resistivity. In a relatively homogeneous system such as dune sand, the total dissolved solids (TDS) content of the groundwater in an area will be the principal factor controlling apparent resistivity. Dune sands are considered to be an exceptionally challenging environment for conducting electrical resistiv- ity surveys, in part because of the very high contact resistance usually encountered between the electrodes and the sand. A secondary objective of this study was to determine the effectiveness of ER methods in the dune field environment at White Sands National Monument. Results Resistivity surveys were conducted along 4 different transects within the monument (Figure A1). The first transect was located at the eastern edge of the dune field near the piezometers WS-002, 003, and 006 and was A p p e n d i x A Electrical resistivity surveys at White Sands National Monument Figure A1.

The rollalong method incorporates a 50% overlap and allows for longer resistivity survey lines. Using a 6 meter electrode spacing, we achieved a depth of investigation of ~32 m (105 ft). The most distinctive fea- tures of this survey are the extensive zones of low apparent resistivity beginning ~5 meters below ground level, an indication that the dunes are probably saturated with very brackish water. Small areas of very high resistivity, indicated by bright orange and red colors, are probably artifacts of the inversion process, and an indication of the high noise level of this data set.

Horizontal scale in this and all other figures is in meters. On Thursday, 12/9, we transported the ER equipment to the northeast corner of the Monument, near the area where Lost River disappears beneath the dunes. We attempted to conduct a long survey of 672 meters over the projected path of Lost River. Although some of the data collected was compromised by logistical problems, we were able to recover 168 meters of the survey data (Figure A4). Using a 6 meter electrode spacing, we achieved a depth of investigation of ~36 m (118 ft). Two broad zones of very low resistivity below ~1190 m elevation probably represent brine-filled sand. A smaller zone of relatively high resistivity below the 125 m position on the profile, ~20 m below ground level, suggests the presence of a lens of porous sand containing fresher water. oriented from southeast to northwest. This survey was done three times using different transect lengths and elec- trode spacing that allowed us to examine the apparent resistivity profile at different scales. On Monday, 12/6, we conducted a 28 electrode ER survey at 3 meter electrode spacing (Figure A2). The terrain-corrected resistivity profile shows a maximum depth of investigation of ~18 m (59 ft). A shallow zone of very low apparent resistiv- ity on the southeast end of the profile probably results from a thin perched aquifer containing brackish water. A deeper zone of somewhat fresher water is suggested by higher resistivity values below 1204 m elevation, sepa- rated by a thin aquitard. Another pocket of fresher water is indicated by higher resistivity values in the dune area at the northwest end of the line. This high resistivity area appears to be connected with higher resistivity values further to the east, and suggests that the dunes may serve as a recharge area for the local hydrologic sys- tem southeast of the dune field. The other two surveys that were conducted in this area showed similar hydro- logic features and suggested the presence of an extensive brine aquifer at greater depth beneath the perched fresher water systems within the dunes.

The shallow area of very high resistivity at the center of the profile is caused by highly compacted sediment and asphalt where the survey line crossed the road bed. A zone of relatively low resistivity ~5 m below ground level, shown in green and extending across most of the profile, probably represents a perched aquifer that is locally recharged by the nearby dunes. Underlying the perched aquifer is an extensive zone of very low resistivity ~15 m below ground level, suggesting the presence of an extensive brine aquifer at greater depth below the perched system. Preliminary results of electrical resistivity surveys at White Sands National Monument clearly indicate that resistivity methods can be conducted in aeolian dune sand, in spite of very high contact resistance. Total dis- solved solids content of groundwater contained within the dunes and adjacent areas appears to be the principal factor controlling apparent resistivity distribution. In most areas surveyed, shallow perched aquifers containing water of variable TDS overlie an extensive brine-filled aquifer system at greater depths (usually 15-20 m below ground level).

The purpose of these surveys was to locate the Jarilla Fault, a basin-scale fault with no surface expression that apparently trends roughly north-south and passes beneath White Sands National Monument and the White Sands Missile Range.

WSNM = White Sands National Monument headquarters; HAFB = Holloman Air Force Base; WSMR = White Sands Missile Range headquarters; Tul = Tularosa; Alm = Alamogordo (modified from McLean, 1975). Geologic Setting The Tularosa Basin is an elongate, north-trending intermontane basin, formed by middle to late Cenozoic continental rifting (Chapin, 1971). The basin is bor- dered by the Sierra Blanca and Sacramento Mountains to the east, and the San Andres, Organ, and Franklin Mountains to the west and southwest (Figure B1). Major normal faults with several thousand meters of vertical displacement separate the basin from the east and west-flanking uplifts (Lozinsky and Bauer, 1991). Igneous and sedimentary rocks of Precambrian through Tertiary age are exposed in escarpments on the east and west sides of the basin (Orr and Myers, 1986). As regional uplift progressed, concurrent erosion of the surrounding highlands has resulted in deposition of several thousand meters of alluvial sediment in the adjacent rift basin. Previous investigations (e.g., Belzer, 1999; King and Harder, 1985) show that the basin consists of two north-trending half-grabens separated by the buried Jarilla fault zone. These grabens contain over 1800 m of Tertiary basin-fill material, consisting of unconsolidated to weakly-indurated gravel, sand, silt and clay eroded from the surrounding highlands. The alluvial fill is underlain by consolidated bedrock, thought to consist largely of Paleozoic carbonates. However, little is known of the underlying bedrock since very few boreholes have penetrated the entire section (McLean, 1970). N E W M E X I C O B U R E A U O F G E O L O G Y A N D M I N E R A L R E S O U R C E S Prior to this study, Healy et al. (1978) estimated the position of the Jarilla Fault based on a gravity high that extends northward from the Hueco and Jarilla mountains to a point southwest of Alamogordo. This gravity high is associated with a band of pre-Cenozoic bedrock that crops out through the valley fill within the Tularosa Basin, indicating a major normal fault system, downthrown to the west (Figure B2). Geologic mapping by Seager et al. (1987) shows the Jarilla Fault extending northward beneath White Sands National Monument; however, the precise location of the fault zone is poorly constrained. An isolated knoll of Paleozoic limestone located across Highway 70 from the WSNM visitors center (Figure B3) may represent a bedrock outlier on the upthrown side of the Jarilla fault zone. Figure B3.

W h i t e S a n d s | A p p e n d i x b | P a g e 2 / 6 Electrical Resistivity Methods The basic operating principal for electrical resistivity surveys involves generating a direct current between two metal electrodes implanted in the ground, while the ground voltage is measured between two additional implanted electrodes. Given the current flow and measured voltage drop between two electrodes, the subsurface resistivity between the electrodes can be determined and mapped. Resistivity profiles detect vertical and lateral variations in resistivity in the subsurface. The presence or absence of water or water-saturated soil or bedrock will strongly affect the results of a resistivity survey. Apparent resistivity values are highest in air-filled pore space in the unsaturated zone, ranging from several thousand to tens of thousands of ohm-meters, depending on factors such as porosity and clay content. Saltwater and brine have very low resistivity, ranging from <1 to a few tens of ohm-meters. Fresh water will show a much higher apparent resistivity, up to several thousand ohm-meters depending on dissolved solids content. Brackish water will display a spectrum of apparent resistivity values ranging from brine to pure water. In a relatively homogeneous system such as an unconsolidated sand and gravel aquifer, the total dissolved solids (TDS) content of the groundwater will be the principal factor controlling apparent resistivity. The depth of investigation for an ER survey is directly related to length of the array of electrodes \u2013 the lon- ger the array, the greater the penetration that can be obtained. For the White Sands investigation, 112 electrode arrays were deployed with an electrode spacing of 6 m, and a full array length of ~660 m. A standard dipole- dipole array configuration used to survey each ER line attained depths of ~150 m. To achieve a greater depth of investigation, the arrays were also coupled to an infinity electrode, creating a pole-dipole configuration that extended the depth of the survey to a maximum of ~230 m. EarthImager-2D\u2122 software was used to process the resistivity data collected at White Sands National Monument. The software uses a forward and inverse modeling procedure to create a synthetic data set based on measured apparent resistivity. This is an iterative process; an L2-norm error factor is calculated for each new iteration. Noisy data points are progressively removed over the course of several iterations until the L2-norm error is reduced to an acceptable level. Every iteration requires the removal of a certain number of data points to attain smoother model output, and ideally the iterative process terminates before too much useful data is filtered out. The resistivity profiles have been terrain-corrected using elevation data collected with survey-grade Topcon GR3\u2122 GPS receivers. The EarthImager software incorporates the elevation data into the inverse modeling pro- cedure to provide estimates of the elevation of subsurface phenomena. Results and Discussion November, 2011 surveys Data collected during the first three days of the November, 2011 investigation relied on shorter arrays of 56 and 82 electrodes at 6 m spacing, which were later deemed insufficiently long to adequately capture the transition from Permian bedrock outcrop to unconsolidated basin fill. The following discussion focuses on results of ER surveys on days 4 and 5 (11/17-18). WHSA4 survey ER survey WHSA4 consists of pole-dipole (Figure B4) and dipole-dipole (Figure B5) resistivity arrays that extend northwest to southeast from a low-relief area of gypsiferous basin floor sediment across a knoll of Permian Hueco Limestone (Figure B3). The pole-dipole survey attained a maximum depth of investigation of 233 m. The dipole-dipole survey, which sacrifices depth to provide greater data resolution, achieved a depth of investigation of 156 m. The position of the WHSA4 survey line was chosen because it crosses an outcrop of Permian Hueco Limestone. It is not clear based on surface geology alone if the limestone outcrop is simply an isolated erosional knoll projecting through the overlying basin fill material, or if it represents the upthrown side of the Jarilla fault (Figure B2). Seager et al. (1987) show the position of the fault about 5 km to the west (Figure B3). However, the location of the fault is based on interpretations of airborne gravity data several decades old (Healy et al., 1978) and is not well-constrained. The possibility exists that the fault trace actually occurs farther to the east. Results of the WHSA4 survey strongly suggest that the outcrop of Hueco Limestone east of the National Monument\u2019s visitor center is a surface indicator of the Jarilla fault zone.

Lower resistivity values at greater depth beneath the outcrop prob- ably reflect water saturated bedrock. The low-relief area of the survey line between 0 and ~350 m is entirely dominated by very low resistivity (<10 ohm-m) in the subsurface, values consistent with brackish to very saline groundwater. This region of low resistivity contrasts sharply with the area of the profile underlying bedrock outcrop, and probably represents Tertiary basin fill material saturated with saline groundwater. A wedge of brackish water-saturated sediment lapping onto the bedrock is also apparent between 396 to 528 m. It appears very likely that the WHSA4 survey line crosses the Jarilla fault zone somewhere between 330 and 430 m. WHSA5 survey The position of the WHSA5 survey line (Figure B3) was chosen in an attempt to cross the mapped location of the Jarilla fault based on the geologic map by Seager et al. (1987). Results from the WHSA4 survey of the previous day indicated that the fault probably occurs several kilometers farther to the east. However, absent any surface manifestation of the fault, its breadth and structural character are unknown, and it is possible that a more basinward section of the fault zone could be present in the area underlying WHSA5. The WHSA5 arrays extend northwest to southeast from the edge of the gypsum dune field across a region of very low relief consisting of basin floor sediment and small playas. The WHSA5 pole-dipole survey attained a maximum depth of investigation of 226 m. The higher-resolution dipole-dipole survey achieved a depth of inves- tigation of 134 m. Both profiles are remarkable for their uniformity and their very low subsurface resistivity (<4 ohm-m) (Figures B6 and B7). Unlike results from the WHSA4 surveys, data from the WHSA5 arrays do not indicate any subsurface structures or higher-resistivity bedrock. Variations in the color field on the resistivity profiles appear to show very subtle variations in the salinity of groundwater in the basin fill sand and gravel aquifer. A band of very low resistivity occurs in the first few meters below ground level between 0 and ~380 m, in an area dominated by small playas. This low resistivity interval probably represents highly brackish, electrically conductive groundwa- ter that has been concentrated by near-surface evaporative processes. Resistivity increases slightly with depth, probably indicating the presence of slightly fresher groundwater between ~1120 and 1190 m. However, we emphasize that this higher resistivity interval represents an increase of only 3 or 4 ohm-m, and is only made Figure B4. WHSA4 pole-dipole resistivity profile. Location of survey shown in figure 3. Solid lines here and in figure 5 diagrammatically indicate approximate location of Jarilla fault zone.

In fact, the most distinctive feature of both profiles is their lack of significant variations in subsurface resistivity. The lens-like appearance of slightly higher resistivity in the dipole- dipole survey is probably a data processing artifact due to fewer data points near the edges of the surveyed area. A slight decrease in resistivity near the bottom of the profile probably reflects a general increase in salinity in the basin fill aquifer at greater depths. August, 2012 surveys Based on results of the November, 2011 resistivity investigation, we conducted additional surveys about 10 km north of WSNM Visitors Center, near the northeast corner of the Monument (Figure B3). Two of the survey lines lie outside the Monument boundaries, on land administered by Holloman Air Force Base. Four ER surveys were conducted, but data from the WHS3 pole-dipole survey was not interpretable because of electrical shorts in the infinity cable. The fault identified during the previous year\u2019s work (Figures B4 and B5) provides one point defining the linear fault zone, but without additional \u201cpinning points\u201d the precise orientation of the fault cannot be determined. We chose the location of the August, 2012 surveys based on an assumption that the fault on line WHSA4 would extend approximately north-northeast, a structural fabric suggested by the gravity surveys of Healy et al. (1978). Survey lines WHS2, WHS1, and WHS4 are oriented approximately east-west (Figure B3). Although for convenience the lines are shown as conjoined in Figures B8 and B9, the ends of the lines were seperated by several tens of meters in the field (130 m between WHS2 and WHS1, and 68 m between WHS1and WHS4). The resistivity profiles have been terrain-corrected using elevation data collected with survey-grade Topcon GR3\u2122 GPS receivers, although this is not obvious because of the extremely flat topography in the study area. The dipole-dipole surveys (Figure B8) attained a maximum depth of investigation of 164 m; the two suc- cessful pole-dipole surveys (Figure B9) achieved a maximum depth of 227 m. The two westernmost dipole- dipole profiles show uniformly low resistivities, <10 ohm-m, and probably represent subtle variations in total dissolved solids of brackish water in the basin fill aquifer. WHS4, the easternmost profile, shows more"

Although for convenience the lines are shown as conjoined in Figures B8 and B9, the ends of the lines were seperated by several tens of meters in the field (130 m between WHS2 and WHS1, and 68 m between WHS1and WHS4). The resistivity profiles have been terrain-corrected using elevation data collected with survey-grade Topcon GR3\u2122 GPS receivers, although this is not obvious because of the extremely flat topography in the study area. The dipole-dipole surveys (Figure B8) attained a maximum depth of investigation of 164 m; the two suc- cessful pole-dipole surveys (Figure B9) achieved a maximum depth of 227 m. The two westernmost dipole- dipole profiles show uniformly low resistivities, <10 ohm-m, and probably represent subtle variations in total dissolved solids of brackish water in the basin fill aquifer. WHS4, the easternmost profile, shows more variation in resistivity, which increases with depth. This pattern of increasing resistivity at depth is also apparent on the easternmost pole-dipole profile (Figure B9). Resistivity values observed at greater depth on the eastern end of both profiles are consistent with resistivity values on line WHSA4 to the south (Figures B4 and B5) that we have interpreted as water-saturated Paleozoic bedrock. A thin high resistivity zone in the uppermost few meters of WHS1 and WHS4 may be a consequence of fresher water near the surface due to recent rainfall in the area. The data suggest that a fault is present between lines WHS1 and WHS4, seperating brackish-water satu- rated basin fill material on the downthrown side of the fault from saturated Paleozoic bedrock to the east, which Figure B7.

Our preliminary interpretation is that the increase in resistivity with depth on line WHS4 reflects a northward extension of the fault zone identified on line WHSA4 during last year\u2019s surveys (Figure B3). However, we emphasize that the two survey areas are seperated by over 10 km, and more subsurface or geophysical information is necessary to definitively support this interpretation. Conclusions Results from electrical resistivity surveys conducted at White Sands National Monument strongly suggest that the Jarilla fault occurs several kilometers farther east than indicated on existing surface geologic maps. Data from the WHSA4 resistivity surveys show higher-resistivity material underlying an area of Permian limestone outcrop transitioning abruptly into much lower resistivity material in the subsurface, consistent with brine-satu- rated basin fill sand and gravel. Results of the WHSA5 resistivity surveys are consistent with a relatively homo- geneous sand and gravel aquifer saturated with brackish to highly saline groundwater. No subsurface structural features are indicated in WHSA5, suggesting that this survey line did not cross the Jarilla fault zone. Resistivity surveys conducted 10 km to the north of WHSA4 also show evidence of water saturated bedrock overlain by ~50 to 150 m of basin fill, consistent with a northern extension of the fault zone.

The survey is made up of two lines totaling about 1.88 miles in length, located near Alamogordo, New Mexico (see Plate I). The purpose of the survey was first to locate the Jarilla Fault in the subsurface north of the Jarilla Mountains; and second, to gather data on its geologic structure. Line WS-1 is located near the White Sands National Monument Visitors Center, and Line WS-2 is located in the northwestern part of Holloman Air Force Base, approximately 3 Yz miles north of Line WS-1. Both lines show a steep, west-dipping normal fault near their eastern end, which is probably the Jarilla Fault. There also is a graben structure in each line, formed by the Jarilla Fault, a steep, east dipping normal fault near the west- ern end of both lines, and a number of fault blocks in between. The graben is wider and more complex on Line WS-2 than it is on Line WS-1, which suggests that it may be narrowing or even closing to the south. Seismic velocities consistent with Tertiary basin fill are present in the western half of Line WS-1, but only present near the surface(<25 ft depth) in Line WS-2. This suggests that the Jarilla Fault may define the margin of the deep Tularosa Basin at Line WS-1, but may be part of a buried bench or pediment at Line WS-2. The presence of this graben on both lines suggests that in this study area, the Jarilla Fault may fairly be described as a fault \"zone\" or fault \"system.\" Introduction During August and September, 2012, a shallow seismic survey was carried out in the area southwest of Alamogordo, in Otero County, New Mexico. The survey consisted of two seismic lines (Lines WS-1 and WS-2) totaling about 1.88 miles in length located near the White Sands National Monument Visitors Center (Line WS-1), and in the northwest part of Holloman Air Force Base (Line WS-2) (see Plate 1). Method The survey was done by Geological Associates' combined refraction and reflection technique. This is a two- man, one vehicle operation. The seismic energy source is an accelerated weight drop source, a Gisco ES-100, with multiple drops (usually between six and twelve) summed at each source point. The receiver array is a land streamer with twelve receivers spaced 10 meters (32.8 feet) apart for a total spread length of 393.6 feet or 120 meters towed behind the seismic truck. The recording instruments are a Geometries multi-channel system with digital recording. The lines were recorded along pre-existing dirt roads. This made the field operation far more effective, and improved data quality considerably. The seismic source is mounted on the back of a four-wheel-drive truck that is driven by the instrument operator. The second man walks behind, helps measure out the line distances, and operates the seismic source (weight drop or thumper). After the operator decides that enough thumps have been made at a given source- or A p p e n d i x C Shallow Seismic Survey Jarilla Fault Investigation Alamogordo, New Mexico August-September, 2012 N E W M E X I C O B U R E A U O F G E O L O G Y A N D M I N E R A L R E S O U R C E S drop-point, he makes a digital recording of the data at that station and the system is moved forward five meters or 16.4 feet, and the process repeated. This arrangement yields 322 stations and records per mile. A typical day's production is one quarter to one third of a mile of new seismic line (80 to 110 records). At each twentieth station a wooden stake marked with the line and station number is driven into the ground beside the track, to allow later recovery of the stations if needed, for example in locating drill sites. For mapping purposes, a band-held GPS is read at the start and end of each line, at line intersections and line bends. After a line is completed, the data are processed and analyzed in the Geological Associates office, which is located in Albuquerque. The refraction data are first analyzed by an experienced refraction interpreter using Rimrock Geophysics' SIP computer refraction analysis system. Our technique usually produces refraction data from the surface down to a depth of about 125-150 feet. The reflection data are next processed and interpreted, using computer programs written by ourselves specifically for data produced by our seismic system. This produces 1200% Common-Depth-Point data, usually composed horizontally to 2400% or 4800%. In other words, each final seismic trace consists of anywhere from twelve to forty-eight traces, digitally summed together. The depth of penetration by our reflection system is typi- cally about 1,000 feet in unconsolidated Tertiary-Quaternary strata. After completion of the field work on a project a final analysis, interpretation and geological assessment of the project are covered by a final report. This normally takes about as long as the fieldwork. Results The quality of the refraction data in this case is excellent. The reflection data are poor in places, but generally of fair to good quality in the zone of primary interest (surface to about 200 feet deep). Refraction data results are illustrated by seismic line, in Figures 1 and 2. The horizontal axis of each figure shows the seismic line profile, with stations represented by open circles. The vertical axis of each figure repre- sents depth below the surface in feet. The body of each figure contains a number of symbols, generally consisting of a line with numbers below. These symbols represent refractors and associated seismic velocities (in feet per second) at a given station. In general, every fifth seismic station or record (every 82 feet) was analyzed. In areas of extra interest or evident complication, more than every fifth profile was analyzed. Seismic velocities on Line WS-1 fall into three general groups"

In areas of extra interest or evident complication, more than every fifth profile was analyzed. Seismic velocities on Line WS-1 fall into three general groups (Figure 1). The first group, labeled Fault Block A, is located between station 1 and approximately station 40, and contains faster velocities approximately 12,000 ft/sec or greater. The second group is labeled Fault block B, and is located in the area between approxi- mately stations 40 and 170. Fault Block B mostly contains seismic velocities that vary between approximately 5,000 to 6,000 ft/sec, although the southeastern end of Fault Block B contains higher velocities ( >10,000 ft/sec) that are consistent with the velocities in Fault Block A. Fault Block C IS located west of station 170. Although the seismic velocities in Fault Block C are similar to those in the adjacent part of Fault Block B, Fault Block Cis still distinguished based on the clear evidence for faulting shown in the reflection data. Seismic velocities on Line WS-2 are more uniform than the velocities on Line WS-1, showing velocities gen- erally 5,000 to 8,000 ft/sec, within approximately 25 feet of the surface. Few seismic velocities typical of either igneous or metamorphic rocks, or younger Tertiary basin fill, were found on line WS-2. In general, seismic compressional wave velocity is a function of the induration of the material through which the seismic wave is travelling. Crystalline igneous or metamorphic rocks, and limestones, typically have the fastest seismic velocities and are much faster than loose, unconsolidated sediments, for example. Seismic velocities in unindurated or poorly indurated sediments typically vary from approximately 1,000 ft/sec to 6,000 ft/sec. Seismic velocities in clastic sedimentary rocks typically vary from approximately 5,000 ft/sec to 10,000 ft/sec. Crystalline rocks, such as limestones, igneous, and metamorphic rocks typically have seismic velocities higher than approximately 10,000 ft/sec. The wide range of values for each category is due to variations in degrees of induration, or alteration such as weathering or local cementation. (Hunt, 2007. See especially Table 1.9). 3,000 ft/sec is generally considered a representative compressional wave velocity for Santa Fe group basin fill It should be noted that if present, saline groundwater may increase the calculated seismic velocity. However, this is unlikely to substantially distort the general relationships described above. On Line WS-1, the seismic velocities calculated in Fault block A are probably crystalline rocks of the type found at the surface in the adjacent Jarilla Mountains. The southeastern end of Fault Block B shows velocities typical of the crystalline rocks in Fault Block A, but deepening from near the surface at approximately station 40, to approximately 50 feet by station 70. W h i t e S a n d s | A p p e n d i x c | P a g e 2 / 1 3 W h i t e S a n d s | A p p e n d i x c | P a g e 3 / 1 3 N E W M E X I C O B U R E A U O F G E O L O G Y A N D M I N E R A L R E S O U R C E S W h i t e S a n d s | A p p e n d i x c | P a g e 4 / 1 3 The remainder of Line WS-1, Fault Block B from approximately station 95 to 170, and Fault Block C, is mostly composed of velocities around 5,500 ft/sec. This is most likely to be older, more compacted Tertiary Santa Fe group basin fill although it is possible it could be clastic sedimentary rock. This seems unlikely, though, since there is little evidence of higher, crystalline rock seismic velocities as in the southeastern end of the line and the adjacent Jarilla Mountains. Thus, seismic velocities in this part of Line WS-1 suggest that the older Santa Fe group basin fill is located from near surface (less than 25 feet depth), to approximately 75 ft to 100 ft depth. Line WS-2 shows almost entirely seismic velocities ranging from 5,000 to 8,000 ft/sec at less than 25 feet depth. Velocities of 8,000 ft/sec or greater are present at greater than 25 feet depth throughout the line, but few velocities greater than 10,000 ft/sec are seen. This suggests that basin fill is at most approximately 25 feet thick throughout line WS-2, and the abundant crystalline rocks of the southeastern end of Line WS-1 are absent from Line WS-2. The faults (green lines) shown on the refraction depth sections are interpreted from the reflection sections (Figures 3 and 4). Not all the faults recognized on the reflection sections are shown on the refraction sections. This is because the refraction analyses alone do not necessarily always provide clear evidence for a fault, possi- bly because the fault in question may not be of severe enough displacement or deformation. The interpreted reflection sections for the lines are shown in Figures 3 and 4. On-interpreted copies of the same sections are shown in Figures 5 and 6. The processing sequence selected, after numerous comparisons, was demultiplex, filter 30-140, re-sample to 1 second at 2 ms sample rate, mute to remove first breaks and groundroll, normal moveout removal at 7,000 ft/sec, CDP stack 1200%, horizontal stack 2:1 to 2400%, hori- zontal stack 2:1 to 4800%, and plot variable area.

In general, the lines bad fair to good reflection data. Both lines show faults that define a graben, bounded on the southeastern and northwestern sides by west- and east-dipping normal faults, respectively. The graben contains five internal faults and is roughly a mile wide on Line WS-2, but only contains one internal fault and is less than half a mile wide on Line WS-1. This suggests that the graben may be narrowing or even closing to the south. Interpretation The refraction data were processed and analyzed first, using SIP. Refraction results suggest that Tertiary basin fill strata may be present in the northwestern part of Line WS-1, but not present on Line WS-2. Reflection results show a graben on both lines. The geometry of the graben is generally similar on both lines, and the two lines are only approximately 3 miles apart. This suggests that the two lines probably cross the same graben. Line WS-1 suggests that the graben contains the Jarilla Fault, given that it overall seems to place Tertiary basin fill strata to the northwest, against bedrock to the southeast. The easternmost normal fault is down to the west, and is therefore probably the Jarilla Fault itself. Given these results, though, it may be more accurate to refer to the Jarilla Fault in this area as the Jarilla Fault Zone or Fault System. Line WS-2 shows no evidence of deep Tertiary basin fill strata, suggesting that the Jarilla Fault or Fault Zone may be crossing a buried pediment or bench in this area, similar to what can be seen in other parts of the Rio Grande Rift such as the Hubble Bench (Kelley, 1982). If so, then deep Tertiary basin fill strata should be found west of Line WS-2 (see Plate II). Note that there is clear reflection evidence of faulting at the west end of Line WS-2, near the saline spring. This suggests that the spring is probably fault controlled. Conclusions 1. Seismic Lines WS-1 and WS-2 suggest that between White Sands and Holloman Air Force base, the Jarilla Fault forms the easternmost normal fault in a system or zone of faulting that defines a graben. This is supported by Line WS-1, which seems to place Tertiary basin fill deposits to the northwest, down against bedrock to the southeast. It is also supported by Line WS-2, which seems to document the same graben. 2. The seismic refraction results indicate that bedrock is exposed at or near the surface on the southeastern end of Line WS-1. This bedrock is probably very similar in composition to that exposed in the adjacent Jarilla Mountains. Bedrock is faulted down to the northwest along Line WS-1, by a series of normal faults.

The Jarilla Fault seems to form the boundary of the deep Tularosa Basin at line WS-1, as indicated by the presence of Tertiary basin fill. However, the Jarilla Fault seems to be crossing a buried pediment or bench at Line WS-2, as indicated by the uniformly very shallow bedrock. This indicates that the actual deep Tularosa Basin probably lies west of Line WS-2 (see Plate II). Recommendation Future investigation should include looking west of Line WS-2, to find the actual margin of the deep Tularosa Basin. References Hunt, R.

The newly constructed wells will be used to conduct a pumping test in order to investigate hydraulic properties of the aquifer system beneath the dune field.

A schematic diagram of the well construction is shown in Figure D2. Both wells are screened over the bot- tom 40 feet; the annuli of the screened intervals up to fifty feet above the bottoms of the boreholes are packed with 10-40 silica sand. Above that the boreholes are sealed with bentonite and grout to the land surface. The pre-existing monitoring well at the locality, WS-007, is 25 feet deep and will also be monitored during the pumping test in order to investigate the connectivity between shallow and deeper aquifer systems at this locality. Completion data for WS-007 is on file with David Bustos of the NPS, WHSA. The pumping well for the test was cased using 6-inch PVC pipe, and is located approximately 17 feet from the shallow monitoring well WS-007. The deeper monitoring well was completed using 2-inch casing, and is located about 60 feet from the pumping well. The USGS will provide specific records regarding drilling and completion of the two newly constructed wells. The USGS drilling supervisor, Art Clark, ran a suite of geophysi- cal logs in the boreholes and these results will be provided to project participants. Borehole cuttings were collected at five-foot intervals during drilling of the monitoring well and are pres- ently being stored by the New Mexico Bureau of Geology and Mineral Resources (NMBGMR), New Mexico Tech. Careful examination of these samples has not been undertaken because the pumping-well borehole was core-drilled from a depth of 25 to 192 feet. Core recovery was quite good, about 83%, and the two-inch diam- eter sediment cores provide a much better record of down-hole lithologic changes than the cuttings obtained during drilling of the monitoring well. The sediment core was photographed during drilling by NMBGMR geologist Bruce Allen, and this photographic record will be made available to project participants as soon as the WS-007 W h i t e S a n d s | A p p e n d i x D | P a g e 1 / 3 N E W M E X I C O B U R E A U O F G E O L O G Y A N D M I N E R A L R E S O U R C E S one-foot photo segments have been stitched together (see Fig. D3 for sample photographs of the sediment core).

It is anticipated that the drilling effort has resulted in the completion of two wells that will shed valuable information about the aquifer system beneath the White Sands, in particular (1) aquifer properties, and (2) connectivity between deeper groundwater and the shallow groundwater system that immediately underlies the dunes. The USGS drilling crew did a first-rate job of drilling and completing the wells, and the acquisition of sediment cores with a high recovery rate was an unanticipated and fortuitous contribution to the project. The next step will be to pump the 6-inch-cased hole in order to determine its yield (the drilling crew seemed to think that 5 to 7 gallons per minute was a good minimum estimate) and plan for the pumping test that will be con- ducted later this year.

Photographs of sediment-core segments obtained from the drilling site. W h i t e S a n d s | A p p e n d i x D | P a g e 3 / 3 Environmental Tracers Six shallow piezometers (WS-001 - WS-006) have been constructed in order to provide additional information about the shallow groundwater system beneath the gypsum dunes. Four of the piezometers are located along the dirt road that extends south from the Administration Building along the east side of the \"edge-of-the-dunes\", not far from NPS monitoring WS-011. The other two piezometers are located within the \"heart-of-the-dunes\" along the loop drive. The piezometers are screened over a relatively short depth interval, and sealed above the screened interval with bentonite. These new wells will allow identification of possible vertical hydraulic gradients or geochemical discontinuities in the shallow groundwater system that cannot be detected with the current array of monitor- ing wells (WS-007-WS-015), since those wells are screened essentially over their entire length. For example, the water level in a very shallow piezometer (screen depth ~3 to 4 feet) near the cottonwood grove south of WS-011 was about two feet beneath the land surface in May, 2010. Water level in a nearby piezometer at a similar elevation, screened at about 10-13 feet, is approximately five feet beneath the land surface. These measurements suggest that local zones of \"perched\" groundwater exist along the flanks of the sand dunes. Furthermore, the water level in the very shallow piezometer was below the screened interval in December, 2010, indicating that the perched aquifer there is ephemeral and subject to seasonal changes in precipitation and evapotranspiration. One of the new piezometers (WS-005) was constructed at the top of the dune (near the Evening Program Area) where tensiometer nests have been deployed. It has been equipped with a water-level datalogger system for continuous measurement of fluctuations in water level. The electrical conductivity of water collected from this piezometer is significantly lower than values obtained from the nearby interdune monitoring well (WS-007), indicating that it is fresher and likely derived in part from direct meteoric recharge on the dune. A piezometer (WS-006) was constructed in the interdune area immediately to the west of the cottonwood- grove piezometers mentioned above. Water level in this well is a little more than 2 meters higher than in the well just to the east of dunes, only ~170 m away. Electrical conductivity of water from this well indicates that it is fresher than waters in wells to the east of the edge-of-the-dunes, reinforcing the idea that the dunes are areas of meteoric recharge to the shallow groundwater system. A water-level datalogger system has been installed in this piezometer as well. In addition to the hydrologic data they will provide, information about the lithology of deposits beneath the dune area is provided by the NPS monitoring wells and new piezometers that have been constructed. Within the dune field, it is reasonably clear that the White Sands (eolian accumulations of gypsum sand) extend, broadly speaking, to a depth of 20 to 30 feet below interdune areas, and are underlain by older siliciclastic basin-fill deposits. These older deposits beneath the sand dunes and immediately to the east of the dunes consist of a mix of interbedded alluvial, eolian, and wetland deposits, of Pleistocene and Holocene age, which create a complex hydrogeologic framework of more permeable and less permeable (confining) beds. The depth scale of vertical heterogeneity in the basin-fill aquifer system underlying the dune field apparently ranges on the order of meters or less, and is therefore quite complex. Construction of a deeper well and performance of a pumping test (future goals of this project) will be needed to clarify the degree of connectivity between deeper (depth-scale 10s of meters) \"regional\" aquifer(s) and the shallow groundwater system that immediately underlies the sand dunes.

In recent years, water users across the region have noted declines in water levels, diminished water quality, reduced spring flow, and significant changes in precipitation frequency and amounts. This study has been an effort to help address some of these concerns. The work presented in this report covers the northeastern region of the Tularosa Basin, along the western mountain front of the Sierra Blanca and Sacramento Mountains, approximately from Carrizozo to northern Alamogordo. This study\u2019s goal was to improve understanding of the ground- water resources in this region by identifying recharge areas and quantities, determining Executive Summary groundwater flow rates and direction, and to interpret the groundwater/surface water interactions that exist in the region. Methods used in this effort included geologic map- ping, groundwater level measurements, and geochemical analyses of the groundwater, springs and streams. The detailed geologic mapping from this study reveals a very complicated geologic framework, with an equally complex aquifer system. In the northeastern region, north of Three Rivers, the geology of the Sierra Blanca Mountains is dominated by volcanic rocks, volcaniclastic sediments, and igneous intrusions. These rocks make up a network of fractured aquifers, crisscrossed by sills and dikes that act as barriers to ground- water flow. As result, this area has an abun- dance of springs. Moving down the mountain front, into the Carrizozo area, there are several permeable sedimentary units composed of interbedded sandstone channel-fills and lower permeability floodplain deposits, which collectively make productive aquifers. These units have a relatively high hydraulic conductivity based on the high proportion of channel-fill sediments, thick intervals of weak cementation, and the relative abun- dance of springs. East of Alamogordo and the steep escarpment of the southern Sacramento Mountains, the geology is composed of a very different group of rock units. Made up of sedimentary Permian and Pennsylvanian age rocks, the Sacramento Mountains are primarily composed of fractured carbonates, as well as conglomerates, sandstones, and siltstones, that dip to the east. Groundwater flows preferentially through these rocks NEW MEXICO BUREAU OF GEOLOGY AND MINERAL RESOURCES 2 primarily due to the karst processes that result in solution enlarged fractures and conduits that easily transmit water. Along the eastern border of the Tularosa Basin is the Alamogordo Fault, which is responsible for the down dropped basin, and the high topographic relief of the Sacramento Mountains. On the western down dropped side of the Alamogordo Fault, there is 3000 to 4000 feet of weakly cemented basin-fill deposits in the Tularosa area. These sedi- ments have a high hydraulic conductivity and are the primary aquifer in the basin. Using water-level measurements col- lected between 2009 and 2011, we were able to determine zones where aquifers are recharging, being pumped, declining, or not changing. Wells that showed recharge trends are generally found at high elevations, screened in the fractured volcanic rocks, as well as the permeable sedimentary units east of Carrizozo. The water levels in these wells are relatively shallow. Recharge enters the aquifers as winter snowmelt in the high mountains, and as monsoon precipitation at lower elevations. Hydrographs that show a pumping trend were found primarily in the basin-fill deposits at low elevations. These records closely follow the agricultural cycle of the area. Wells that show steady declines to the water table of more than 1 ft per year are scattered throughout the study area. The highest density is in the north, around the Nogal drainage. Hydrographs that demon- strated less than 1 ft of fluctuation per year were classified as \u201cno change.\u201d This trend made up about 30% of the wells that were monitored, and are primarily located in less permeable sandstones, near Carrizozo. The geochemical analyses of the groundwater, springs and streams served to emphasize the complex hydrogeologic system of the mountain front. The observations of spatial trends in water chemistry are highly correlated to the geology and the flow path that the groundwater follows through the subsurface. Water chemistry reveals weather- ing of carbonates is dominant, but silicate weathering is more common in some of the northern regions where volcanic materials are more prevalent. The stable isotopic compositions of well and spring samples collected in the study area was used to help identify recharge areas, assess recharge mechanisms, and character- ize groundwater flow paths. We found most water undergoes evaporation, either in the shallow soil or mountain streams before recharging the groundwater system. Further analysis of stable isotopes shows the majority of the groundwater recharge occurs as result of summer monsoon rain; however, several springs located at high elevations near Sierra Blanca are isotopically light, suggesting their source is winter precipitation. Groundwater age (or residence time) indicates that although much of the ground- water is very old, there is young water that makes its way into the system and mixes with the older water. There is no obvious correlation between the occurrence of this young water and topography. It should be noted that the mixing of young and old waters likely occurs by groundwater mixing due to spatial variations in the flow velocity of groundwater along a flow path. The tortuous flow paths through different lithologies and structures in this mountain hydrologic system likely result in a large range of velocities that cause the mixing of waters of different ages. Our results also suggest within the different drainages, water enters the system at different points along a flow path, thereby mixing younger water with older water. The high spatial variability in the groundwater ages is consistent with stable isotope results. This suggests that flow paths in different areas are isolated from each other. To quantify the total mean annual volume of recharge entering the basin we conducted Darcy Flow calculations along cross sections parallel to the mountain front. This calculation determined approximately 68,000 AFY of water enters the basin in this area. The Darcy Flow calculations were then northeastern tularosa basin region 3 compared with other recharge approxima- tions from previous studies to determine the approximate volume entering the system via the different recharge mechanisms: moun- tain-block recharge (MBR) and mountain- front recharge (MFR). MFR describes runoff"

The high spatial variability in the groundwater ages is consistent with stable isotope results. This suggests that flow paths in different areas are isolated from each other. To quantify the total mean annual volume of recharge entering the basin we conducted Darcy Flow calculations along cross sections parallel to the mountain front. This calculation determined approximately 68,000 AFY of water enters the basin in this area. The Darcy Flow calculations were then northeastern tularosa basin region 3 compared with other recharge approxima- tions from previous studies to determine the approximate volume entering the system via the different recharge mechanisms: moun- tain-block recharge (MBR) and mountain- front recharge (MFR). MFR describes runoff from ephemeral and perennial mountain streams infiltrating into adjacent basin sediments. A previous study approximated streamflow from the mountain front. MBR estimates the volume of water that recharges in the high mountains, slowly flows down gradient through the aquifers present in the mountain block, before entering the basin-fill aquifer. By subtracting the estimated stream- flow from the Darcy Flow calculation, we are left with the MBR amount. We found that sixty-six percent of recharge is from MFR, and the remaining thirty-three percent is from MBR. The results of this study have signifi- cantly increased our knowledge about the hydrologic system responsible for recharging the northeastern Tularosa Basin region from the east. With added pressures of population growth, local communities and agricultural needs are increasingly utilizing groundwater. Continued water level moni- toring will be crucial to monitor potential groundwater depletion. With increased dependence on local groundwater, commu- nity education related to water conservation is highly encouraged. NEW MEXICO BUREAU OF GEOLOGY AND MINERAL RESOURCES 4 Significance This report presents the results of a hydrogeo- logic investigation along the western Sacramento Mountains and the northeastern region of the Tularosa Basin. The principal objective of this study is to develop a better understanding of the water chemistry, physical hydrology and geologic framework that controls the occurrence and movement of groundwater in the region. Numerous small, rural population centers, inclu- ding Carrizozo, Nogal, Oscuro, Three Rivers, Tularosa, and La Luz, are located in the study area. These communities rely on high elevation watersheds in the Sacramento Mountains that serve as sources of recharge to local aquifers. These high elevation watersheds also feed the stream systems that drain into the Tularosa Basin. In recent years, water managers and users across the region have observed changes in precipitation patterns, climate variability, and declines in water levels and spring flow. In response to these stresses on the hydrologic system related to population growth, economic development, and water use changes, water resource managers are interested in understand- ing their groundwater system better, allowing them to make informed decisions regarding land and water resource management. Hydrologic study of the Tularosa Basin dates back to the early 1900s based on work by Meinzer and Hare (1915). This initial research, as well as more recent studies conducted in the past 50 years, has emphasized the role that precipitation, which falls on the adjacent Sacramento Mountains, plays on recharge entering the Tularosa Basin. Although the pres- ent study focuses primarily on the northeastern region of the Tularosa Basin, it adds to the understanding of the regional hydrogeology and provides evidence of the importance of high mountain precipitation in recharging adjacent I. INTRODUCTION regional aquifers. The results of this work includes identification of recharge areas, quantifi- cation of recharge to groundwater, determination of groundwater flow directions and flow rates, and it furthers the understanding of groundwater/ surface water interactions in this area. Description of study area Spanning the northeastern Tularosa Basin and the Sacramento Mountains, the study area exhibits a diverse array of landscapes ranging from scrubland deserts to alpine mountain slopes. The area of investigation extends from the town of Carrizozo in the north to Alamogordo in the south (Fig. 1). The high peaks of Sierra Blanca and Carrizo Mountain lie along the northeastern study area boundary, with the southern Sacramento Mountains on the southeast boundary. Many small communities in the study area include High Rolls, Tularosa, La Luz, Bent, Oscuro, Three Rivers, and Nogal (Fig. 1). Highway 54 gently curves from northwest to northeast (in a northward direction) near the western study area boundary. Highway 380 goes northwest-southeast through Carrizozo in the northern study area. To the south Highway 70 connects Ruidoso and Alamogordo. The west- ern boundary of the study area coincides with the eastern boundary of the White Sands Missile Range. Ranging in elevation from 1200 to 3649 m (4000 to 11,973 ft), the study area exhibits a variety of climates. Across this broad range of topography most of the precipitation accumulates during monsoonal storms in July, August, and September and only 26\u201327% falls in the cooler months of November through March. Average summer temperatures vary from 43\u201394\u00b0F and average winter temperatures of 18\u201364\u00b0F (http:// www.wrcc.dri.edu/summary/climsmnm.html).

These zones were identified using topographic and geologic characteristics. More detail on the physiography, topography, and geography of the study area is available in Koning et al. (2014) and Kelley et al. (2014). Data presented in this report for the SHM region are from the western escarpment of the SHM region, in contrast to work done by Newton et al. (2012) which described studies in the eastern high mountain region. Study Area Regions Tularosa Basin (TB) Well-known for its gypsum sand dunes (the White Sands) and the Carrizozo lava flow (commonly called the Malpais), the fault- bounded Tularosa Basin extends ~85 km (~53 mi) north-south and 30\u201334 km (18\u201321 mi) west-east. The study area encompasses parts of this basin (Fig. 2), where elevation ranges from 1200\u20131520 m (4000\u20135000 ft). The basin's eastern bounding fault, called the Alamogordo fault, is an important structure in the study area and we discuss it in more detail in the geologic structure section. Near Three Rivers and to the south, the landscape is characterized by west-sloping alluvial fans that coalesce westward into a gently west-sloping desert plain. The vegetation of this arid landscape is primarily Chihuahuan scrubland with sparse grass. Major shrubs include creosote, mesquite, and saltbrush\u2014the latter two becoming more abundant to the west and southwest. In the northwest corner of the study area, the floor of the basin is occupied by the extremely rough Carrizozo lava flow, which locally exhibits up to 15 m (50 ft) of topographic relief. Carrizozo Hilly Plain (CHP) The \u201cCarrizozo hilly plain\u201d refers to the low-relief terrain lying between the Alamogordo fault and the mountainous area of Sierra Blanca and Carrizo Mountain (Fig. 2). Although many hills and small mountains are present in this region, gently sloping piedmonts constitute the dominant landform. The piedmonts include alluvial fans adjacent to mountains that coalesce down slope to the west. Piedmont elevations range from 1390 to 2130 m (4550\u20137000 ft) and the surface is variably dissected. The various hills and mountains reach elevations of northeastern tularosa basin region 7 1950\u20132440 m (6400\u20138000 ft). South of Oscuro, the vegetation of this region is charac- terized by desert scrub dominated by creosote, mesquite, and saltbrush. Grass cover here is slightly denser than in the Tularosa Basin to the west. In a zone extending ~13 km (~8 mi) north of Oscuro, this scrubland transitions northward into grassy plains containing scat- tered soaptree yucca and very sparse mesquite. These grassy plains extend from Carrizozo eastward toward Nogal (Fig. 2). Northern High Mountains (NHM) The northern high mountains include Carrizo Mountain and Sierra Blanca (Fig. 2). In these mountains, pi\u00f1on and juniper trees dominate between 1800 and 2700 m (6000 and 9000 ft), locally with stands of ponderosa pine near ~2400 m (~8000 ft). Spruce and aspen trees may be found above ~2400 m (8,000 ft). Patches of scrub oak may occur between 2100 m and 3050 m (7000 and 10,000 ft). Carrizo Mountain lies northeast of Carrizozo and the Sierra Blanca highland extends north of Black Mountain, the later being located 28 km (17 mi) northeast of Tularosa (Fig. 2). Sierra Blanca consists of a broad ridge that gradually decreases in elevation northwards, from 3649 m (11,973 ft; the elevation of the highest point, Sierra Blanca Peak) to 2440\u20132680 m (8000\u20138800 ft) near Church Mountain and Diamond Peak (Fig. 2). The western and north- ern flanks of the Sierra Blanca highland boast the highest topographic relief in New Mexico and the flanks of Carrizo Mountain are also impres- sively steep. Southern High Mountains (SHM) High-elevation ridges extend south of Black Mountain and merge into the southern Sacramento Mountains in the vicinity of Bent (Fig. 2). In the study area, the north-trending crest of the Sacramento Mountains generally lies at an elevation of 2400\u20132700 m (8000\u20139000 ft). These mountains are capped by spruce and pon- derosa forests. Pinon-juniper interspersed with scrub oak patches extends from the crest down to ~1800 m (6000 ft) elevation, and Chihuahuan desert scrubs grow on the lower slopes. Purpose and Scope The purpose of this project is to provide fun- damental geologic data, hydrologic data, and interpretations on the northeastern region of the Tularosa Basin, from Carrizozo to Nogal, south to Alamogordo and High Rolls (Fig. 1). The primary objectives include: \u2022 Identification of the recharge areas for this region \u2022 Quantifying the groundwater recharge \u2022 Assessing the flow directions and rates of groundwater movement \u2022 Examining the interactions between differ- ent aquifers, as well as groundwater-surface water interactions NEW MEXICO BUREAU OF GEOLOGY AND MINERAL RESOURCES 8 Over the past 100 years, there have been numer- ous geological and hydrogeological studies in the Tularosa Basin. O. E. Meinzer, credited as the father of modern hydrogeology, did some of his first work in the field of hydrogeology studying the Tularosa Basin (Meinzer and Hare, 1915). In this section we will cover major conclusions of previous work done in this region. Geology The earliest publications germane to the study area pertained to the Carrizozo lava flow (Harrington, 1885; Tarr, 1891) and the general structure of the Tularosa Basin. Four workers inferred that the Carrizozo lava flow covered an old riverbed or that an underground stream flowed southward in channels carved beneath the lavas (Harrington, 1885; Herrick, 1900; Tight, 1905; MacBride, 1905). Herrick (1904), and MacBride (1905) also recognized that the Tularosa Basin represented a large block of the Earth's crust that was down-dropped between basin-bounding faults. Several early 20th century studies focused on various mining districts in the compilation area or analyzed the geology for petroleum potential. Koning et al.

Targeting an audience of oil geologists, Darton (1922) undertook an ambi- tious effort to summarize the stratigraphy and geologic structure of New Mexico. He described the igneous rocks of Sierra Blanca as \u201can older porphyry and a thick succession of late Paleo- gene fragmental and effusive sheets, dikes, and stocks of various kinds\u201d (Darton, 1922, p. 223). He also interpreted Carrizo Mountain as a stock and the Phillips Hills as a non-faulted anticline on the east side of a synclinal Tularosa Basin. II. Previous work Several detailed geologic investigations and mapping efforts, conducted in the late 1950s through the early 1990s, advanced our understanding of the stratigraphy and geologic structure in the study area. Foremost among these was geologic mapping by Lloyd Pray in the southern Sacramento Mountains (Pray, 1952, 1961). Although his work did not extend into the study area, the stratigraphy he developed laid the groundwork for future sedimentologic and strati- graphic studies in the Sacramento Mountains. Otte (1959) mapped the Sacramento Mountains between Alamogordo and 10 km (6 mi) north of Tularosa. Robert Weber (1964) made the first detailed geologic map of the area around and southeast of Carrizozo. Structural characteriza- tion of the Sierra Blanca Basin as a north- trend- ing, synclinal depression was first made by Wegemann (1914), an interpretation confirmed by Bodine (1956), Weber (1964), and Kelley and Thompson (1964). Under the tutelage of Vincent Kelley, Tommy Thompson investigated the Sierra Blanca volcanic field and established an initial stratigraphy for the rocks there (Thompson, 1966, 1972, 1973, 1974). Stratigraphic, sedimen- tologic, and paleontologic work on Cretaceous and Eocene strata southwest of Carrizozo was accomplished by Thompson (1973), Arkell (1983), Lucas et al. (1989), and Cather (1991). Additional research was conducted in the Sierra Blanca and surrounding mountains around 1990. This effort resulted in two geologic maps of the Mescalero Apache Reservation in the southern part of the Sierra Blanca volcanic field (Moore et al., 1988a, b). New data and ideas regarding the structure and igneous rocks of this area were presented in Moore et al. (1991). Studies by Allen and Foord (1991) and Pertl and Cepeda (1991) focused on the intrusions of the northern study area, with the former summariz- ing several radiometric ages (including those from Weber, 1971). northeastern tularosa basin region 9 Hydrogeology and hydrology The most significant and comprehensive previous study of the Tularosa Basin is Meinzer and Hare (1915). They investigated both the geology and groundwater of the Tularosa Basin, describing the physiography, geomorphology, bedrock and basin-fill geology, hydrology and precipitation trends. Specifically, Meinzer and Hare (1915) describe the spatial and tempo- ral variability of precipitation showing that precipitation varies with altitude, that most of it occurs in the months of June-September, and that precipitation increases somewhat to the north. The geologically young Carrizozo lava flows are very permeable according to Meinzer and Hare (1915). They also divide aquifers of the region into groups including: a) valley fill, b) Cretaceous-age rocks and overlying units (on the east wall of the Alamogordo fault), and c) Car- boniferous rocks (i.e., Permian and Pennsylvanian age layers). A regional water table map is included in Meinzer and Hare (1915). They suggest that infiltration of precipitation mostly occurs along proximal fans, with little to no infiltration (recharge) in the middle to distal fan locations. A more recent regional water table map, con- structed by Embid and Finch (2011), shows simi- lar trends to those shown in the map of Meinzer and Hare (1915). Most of the study area described in this report lies along the eastern and northeastern margin of the Tularosa Basin. The Tularosa Basin\u2019s groundwater is dominantly saline (total dissolved solids (TDS >1000 mg/L) with a large proportion of brines (TDS >35,000 mg/L) and less than 0.2% of the saturated deposits contain fresh water (McLean, 1970). Orr and Meyers (1986) estimated that 85% of the saturated deposits in the basin may contain saline water with TDS values greater than 3000 mg/L. Fresh water is primarily located in alluvial fan deposits on the eastern and western margins of the basin (Orr and Myers, 1986). In general, water quality decreases with depth and toward the center of the basin. Previous Recharge Estimates Previous research has attempted to quantify recharge to the Tularosa Basin. Here we will summarize this research and later will analyze how it compares with our findings. Rau (1986) estimated recharge entering the basin along a cross section at the mouth of the Nogal drain- age. This research used a Darcy Flow approxi- mation based on several aquifer tests conducted in the basin-fill. Waltemeyer (2001) assumed the sole source of recharge to the basin was via runoff. To estimate recharge, the study area was delineated into 12 separate drainage basins. The Basin- Climatic Characteristic Method was applied to each drainage basin to estimate streamflow (Waltemeyer, 2001). This method takes into account the area of each drainage basin and the average precipitation. It is very rough approximation and does not account for numerous important factors, such as rock type, slope, and vegetation. It is not as precise as a streamflow-gauging system. That said, the Basin-Climatic Characteristic Method is a simple approximation that can be conducted via com- puter entirely from existing data. Research conducted in 2006 by Livingston and Shomaker for the \u201c40-year water devel- opment plan\u201d used an alternative method to estimate recharge called the Surplus Precipitation Method. Similar to the work by Waltemeyer, the mountain front was"

Similar to the work by Waltemeyer, the mountain front was delineated into individual drainage basins. The analysis of watershed yield is based on finding the elevation at which pre- cipitation exceeds potential evaporation, plant transpiration, and interception. Then, by finding the area of each watershed above that eleva- tion, surplus precipitation (or recharge) can be calculated. This method accounts for all recharge entering the system and not only runoff. Like the Basin-Climatic Characteristic Method, this is a simple approximation that can be conducted on a computer with existing data. There is a great deal of uncertainty associated with both of these methods. NEW MEXICO BUREAU OF GEOLOGY AND MINERAL RESOURCES 10 Data description Existing and previously reported data used in this study include published geologic maps, subsurface geologic data from well records and lithologic logs, hydrologic consultants\u2019 reports, weather station data, and historical depth-to- water and water quality data from published and unpublished sources. New data collected by the NMBGMR, contractors and students from 2009 to 2012 includes: \u2022 Geologic mapping at 1:24,000-scale with cross sections \u2022 Subsurface geologic unit identification from well logs \u2022 Accurate measurements of field site locations \u2022 Characterization the geologic setting of spring and well sites \u2022 One-time and repeated depth-to-water measurements in wells \u2022 One-time and repeated geochemical, isotopic, and environmental tracer sampling from wells, springs, streams, and precipitation Water-level measurements can provide insight about the occurrence and direction of groundwater flow. Repeated water-level measurements and/or continuous measurements provide information about daily, monthly and seasonal fluctuations that occur in an aquifer system. Details about the new data collected for this study are described and interpreted in this report. Details about water sampling proce- dures, analysis methods and systematics are described in Timmons et al. (2013). III. METHODS Geologic data Geologic Maps and Cross Sections Geologic mapping at a scale of 1:24,000 was conducted August 2007 through July 2011 (Fig. 3). These 1:24,000-scale quadrangles were then compiled in two 1:50,000-scale geologic maps (Kelley et al., 2014; Koning et al., 2014). The general method for mapping the 1:24,000-scale quadrangles entailed field traverses and interpretations of aerial photogra- phy. Initial work involved reconnaissance inspection and/or mapping of representative parts of a quadrangle with a hand-held GPS unit and U.S. Geological Survey topographic maps. This preliminary map was then utilized in identifying and mapping units using aerial photography. On four of these quadrangles (Tularosa, Tularosa NE, Three Rivers, and Oscuro), Daniel Koning mapped contacts and identified units from aerial photographs using the PG-2 plotter at the U.S. Geological Survey in Denver. Line work from the aerial pho- tograph-based mapping was then field-checked during subsequent field visits to a quadrangle. After 2012, further air photograph mapping and contact refinements were accomplished on the Three Rivers, western Oscuro, and northern Godfrey Hills quadrangles using the Stereo Analyst extension for ArcGIS 10.1 and related 3-D viewing hardware. The compilation phase of the project spanned from July 2011 through June of 2014. The major tasks of this phase included devel- oping a map unit nomenclature applicable for the entire study area, writing unit descriptions for these regional map units, edge-matching the geology along the quadrangle boundaries, field checking geology in certain areas (such as along quadrangle boundaries), and construct- ing 14 cross sections. Given the large area and Figure 3\u2013Published 1:24,000-scale geologic maps (shown in gray) completed for this study. The red lines represent the boundaries Tularosa Basin geologic compilation maps. Note that there is overlap between the two geologic compilation maps in the Three Rivers area. northeastern tularosa basin region 11 the desired scale of 1:50,000, two compilation maps were constructed (Fig. 3). One compilation map covers the northern half of the study area (Koning et al., 2014) and the other encompasses the southern half of the study area (Kelley et al., 2014), with two quadrangles in the middle included in both (Three Rivers and the western half of the Golondrina Draw quadrangle). Location of sites All sample and measurement sites (wells, springs, streams, precipitation collectors) were located using a hand-held Garmin 76 or 76S global positioning system (GPS) and were assigned a study identification number (TB-####) (Fig. 4). The elevations of the sites were derived in ArcGIS from a 10-meter horizontal resolution digital elevation model. All spring sites were characterized in the field in terms of the physical characteristics of the discharge point and site conditions. Wells used in this study were inventoried in detail to describe the type of well, its construction, and a description of the measuring point used for water-level measure- ments (Appendix 1). Water-level data For this study, water-level measurements were obtained from numerous private wells (Fig. 4). Attempts were made to identify the well record associated with each well from the New Mexico Office of the State Engineer. The well records provide details about the drilling and construc- tion of the well, in addition to the geologic units encountered while drilling (Appendix 2). Water-level measurements in most wells were made on a monthly to bimonthly basis between fall 2009 and summer 2011(Appendix 3). From a specific measuring point on each well, depth to water measurements were made by staff of the Bureau using one of several different techniques. To insure accuracy, water levels measured with a steel tape were repeated until the measurement was within 0.02 feet of an earlier measurement. In wells with no dedicated pump equipment, water levels were measured with an electronic Figure 4A\u2013Site inventory map of the northern portion of the"

In wells with no dedicated pump equipment, water levels were measured with an electronic Figure 4A\u2013Site inventory map of the northern portion of the study area.

Eleven wells were monitored with continu- ous water-level recorders for various time inter- vals ranging from a few months to several years (Fig. 4). These were programmed to record water level and temperature at hourly intervals for the duration of the study. Water-level recorders were checked and downloaded every three to four months, and water levels were measured manu- ally at those times (Appendix 4). Geochemical Methods Chemical and isotopic analysis of precipita- tion, streams, springs, and well waters provide insight into the flow path of groundwater, where it is recharged, and its residence time in the subsurface. For this study, water was sampled for a number of analyses including major ion chemistry, trace metal chemistry, stable isotopes of oxygen and hydrogen, and several naturally occurring environmental tracers which provide estimates of groundwater age. Major ion chemistry and trace metals can provide informa- tion about the \u201clife\u201d of the water and the flow path it has traveled from recharge to dis- charge location, and various other influences within the hydrologic cycle. Stable isotopes of hydrogen and oxygen are useful tools for tracking precipitation through a hydrologic system, and determine what time of year water recharged the aquifer (i.e. monsoon precipitation or snowmelt). Tritium is an environmental tracer that can help determine the relative age of groundwater less than fifty years old. Another environmental tracer that we used to help determine the age of the groundwater was carbon-14. Chlorofluorocarbons (CFC) sampling can provide very accurate groundwater age dating. A more complete summary of sampling and analytical methods are described in detail in Timmons et al. (2013). northeastern tularosa basin region 15 Geology Regional Geology Tectonic forces associated with the Rio Grande rift, combined with extensive erosion over the past 25 million years, are largely responsible for the present-day landscape of the study area (Figs. 5, 6). The Sierra Blanca Basin is an important structure between Carrizozo and Ruidoso that began forming prior to rifting. Carrizo Moun- tain represents one of many intrusions along the Capitan lineament. Below, we expound on these three regional geologic features. Rio Grande Rift The Rio Grande rift is characterized by fault- bounded basins and mountains. This tectonic feature extends from southern Colorado south to the Las Cruces-El Paso area, where it merges with the larger Basin and Range extensional province. In southern New Mexico, the rift is 150\u2013160 km (90\u2013100 mi) wide and there are commonly 3\u20134 extensional basins along a given latitude. The Tularosa Basin exemplifies a fault- bounded basin in the southern Rio Grande rift. This basin is internally drained and has extensive deposits of salts, mainly gypsum, in the topo- graphically lowest area of the basin (southwest of the study area and west of White Sands National Monument). Structurally, the Tularosa Basin consists of two half-grabens tilted in opposite directions (Lozinsky and Bauer, 1991). The eastern half-graben is 25\u201330 km (15\u201320 mi) wide, tilted to the east, and is bounded on the east by the west-down Alamogordo fault zone. Rift basin-fill, called the Santa Fe Group, thick- ens eastward in this eastern half graben. Maximum basin-fill thickness estimates range IV. RESULTS from 900 to 2400 m (3000\u20138000 ft) based on data in Healy et al. (1978), Orr and Myers (1986), and modeling of Peterson and Roy (2005). Along the Alamogordo fault, basin-fill is probably deepest south of Alamogordo and shallower to the north (Koning, 1999). In the Tularosa area, researchers (Peterson and Roy, 2005; Healy et al., 1978; Orr and Myers, 1986) estimate a maximum basin-fill thickness of 900\u20131200 m (3000\u20134000 ft). Rift-related, west-down displacement along the Alamogordo fault created the western face of the southern Sacramento Mountains, which have been tilted eastward. The Sacaramento Mountains are underlain mainly by sedimentary rocks of Pennsylvanian to Permian age. East of the town of Tularosa, the lower mountain-front profile exhibits a bench-like geomorphic feature that generally overlies the Permian-age Abo For- mation (Fig. 5). There is 750\u2013850 m (2460\u20132800 ft) of topographic relief between this bench and the crest of the Sacramento Mountains. This higher escarpment is underlain by the Yeso Formation capped by the San Andres Formation (Fig. 6; Newton et al., 2012; Rawling, 2012). Sierra Blanca Basin Although the Sierra Blanca mountains are topographically high, the volcanic and intrusive igneous rocks that compose these mountains actually fill a large depression in the Earth\u2019s crust called the Sierra Blanca Basin. This structural depression extends between Three Rivers and Ruidoso and is identified on regional New Mexico geology maps by northeast-elongated exposures of Mesozoic rocks surrounded by Paleozoic rocks (Fig. 5). Near and north of Ruidoso, the eastern margin of the Sierra Blanca Basin coincides with west-down, north- to northeast-trending faults within a 4\u201312 km (2.5\u20137.5mi) wide zone.

Simplified from Koning et al. (2014) and Kelley et al. (2014). B northeastern tularosa basin region 19 contains a relatively dense network of similarly trending dikes (Rawling, 2009, 2011). The southern margin of the Sierra Blanca Basin is cut by at least four east- to northeast-striking, north-down faults with 200\u2013250 m (650\u2013820 ft) of vertical offset. Capitan Lineament A regional, west- to northwest-trending linea- ment of igneous intrusions is found near the northern boundary of the study area (Fig. 5). A lineament, in geologic terms, refers to a linear feature in a landscape which is an expression of an underlying geologic structure, in this case, a band of volcanic intrusions. These intrusions are generally of granitic composition (e.g., Carrizo Mountain and Capitan Mountains). However, the source of the basaltic Carrizozo lava flow, Little Black Peak, also lies along this lineament. Geologic Structure The geologic structure in the study area is generally a result of crustal blocks tilting between normal faults. Except for the eastern margin of the Sierra Blanca Basin , folding is relatively minor and generally related to either drag folding along normal faults or, to older tectonic events. Faults can influence groundwater flow and thus are important to consider in a hydro- geologic study. Offset along faults may juxtapose a high-permeability unit, such as porous sandstone, against a low-permeability unit like mudstone\u2014thereby creating fault barriers and potentially blocking groundwater flow. Faults in bedrock create a fracture network that may enhance permeability and direct groundwater flow parallel to the fault. Some springs in the study area, such as Aguilar Spring (TB-1029) and Maxwell Spring (TB- 1010), are associated with bedrock fault zones. Faulting in basin-fill commonly results in low-permeability fault damage zones and clayey fault cores, which may create local groundwater barriers. A more complete discussion of faults is given in Koning et al. (2014) and Kelley et al. (2014). Hydrology Precipitation Groundwater recharge to the Tularosa Basin comes in the form of precipitation. It is impor- tant, therefore, to understand regional climatic and geographic controls on the spatial and temporal variability of precipitation in the area. In this section we discuss important regional weather patterns and analyze existing local precipitation data. Precipitation Patterns The primary source of precipitation in the Tularosa Basin and surrounding mountains is associated with the North American Monsoon. This northward migration of moist air from the eastern Pacific and the Gulf of California, as well as the Gulf of Mexico, results in intense afternoon thunderstorms in July, August and September. These rains account for more than half of the annual precipitation. Conversely, November through April is usually the driest period, with April typically the driest month (Malm, 2003). The spatial variability of precipi- tation is usually related to surface elevation. As air is forced up and over topographic features such as mountains, moisture within the air condenses and falls as precipitation. Therefore, areas of high elevation usually receive more precipitation than those at lower elevations (Liebmann et al., 2008, Stensrud et al., 1995, Gochis and Higgins, 2007, Ritchie et al., 2007, Ritchie and Szenasi, 2006, National Weather Service, n.d. a, National Weather Service, n.d. b, National Weather Service Southern Region Headquarters, 2006, National Weather Service Climate Prediction Center, 2003). There are several climate disturbances that can impact the precipitation received by the area. Tropical storms originating in the Gulf of Mexico or eastern Pacific can also add signifi- cant amounts of rain to the southwestern U.S. These storms generally occur at the end of the monsoon season (National Weather Service Climate Prediction Center, 2003; Ritchie et al., 2007; Ritchie and Szenasi, 2006). During the winter, frontal storms are the primary source Figure 7\u2013 Average annual precipitation versus elevation. The total annual precipitation at weather stations listed in Table 1 increases linearly with elevation, indicating that there is more precipitation at higher elevation than at lower elevations. 4500 6500 7500 9500 8500 5500 3500 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 R2 = 0.95 Elevation (feet amsl) Rainfall (in) Table 1\u2013NOAA weather stations within the region used for examination of historical precipitation, as well as an analysis of the 2009 and 2010 precipitation.

For a more detailed analysis of the precipitation patterns throughout the region, please refer to Newton et al. (2012). Historic Precipitation Daily precipitation amounts have been recorded in the Tularosa Basin and vicinity for most of the past century, with some records dating back to 1895. These detailed records are available from the Western Regional Climate Center, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) (see http://www.wrcc. dri.edu/summary/climsmnm.html). Portions of this record have been compiled to show general trends in annual and seasonal precipitation in the study area. Average annual precipitation ranges from 66 cm/year (26.0 in/year) in Cloudcroft to 26 cm/year (10.2 in/year) in Tularosa. Figure 7 shows a linear regression for average annual pre- cipitation reported at weather stations listed in Table 1, as a function of elevation. Correlation with elevation is good with an R2 value of 0.95, indicating that elevation is a strong predictor of average annual rainfall in the study area. Using precipitation data collected at seven different weather stations in the area, we com- pared the historical climate record with the time frame over which the study was conducted (Table 1). The previous study in this area, which focused on the eastern side of the Sacramento Mountains, was conducted from 2005\u20132009 (Newton et al., 2012). During this study period precipitation values were quite high, exceeding the average by 18%. The 2005\u20132009 period was unique in that it saw the wettest month on record, July 2008, and the third wettest year on record, 2006 (Newton et al., 2012). Water-level measurements from the western side of the Sacramento Mountains and Tularosa Basin were collected between 2009 and 2011. Whereas the three previous years had above average rainfall, 2009 received 17% less precipi- tation than average throughout the study area. 2010 saw a slight increase in precipitation receiv- ing 5% more precipitation than average (Table 1). The 2009 monsoon season was one of the driest on record, with only 8.5 inches of pre- cipitation at Cloudcroft, compared with the 13 inch annual average. The 2009 to 2010 winter, however, saw nearly 11.5 inches of equivalent precipitation, compared with 6.5 inch average.

Three Rivers is an ephemeral stream that flows southwest from the western slopes of Sierra Blanca in the central region. At its head- waters are several springs which discharge from Sierra Blanca volcanic rocks. Three Rivers drains The 2010 to 2011 period saw an entirely opposite record, receiving above average precipi- tation (20.9 inches) during the 2010 monsoon, and only 2.1 inches of precipitation during the winter of 2010 to 2011. Streams and Drainage Basins Previous research conducted in the area suggests streamflow plays a major role in recharging the Tularosa Basin aquifers (Garza and McLean, 1977; Orr and Myers, 1986; Waltemeyer, 2001; Huff, 2004; Livingston and Shomaker, 2006). It is therefore important to analyze streamflow and its contributing factors. Surface water that flows from the Sacramento Mountains generally originates from springs and seasonal runoff. A study conducted by the USGS focused on major drainages and watersheds along the edges of the Tularosa Basin (Waltemeyer, 2001). The range front was delineated into 12 drainage basins, ranging from 0.87\u2013157 mi2. Waltemeyer (2001) used a Basin-Climatic Characteristics Method that attempts to estimate annual stream flow by taking into account the drainage basin area, the average precipita- tion, and evaporation. Precipitation estimates were determined based on the average elevation of each drainage basin. These elevations were plotted on the trend line created by the annual precipitation vs. elevation graph (e.g., Fig. 7) to estimate an average annual precipitation value for each drainage basin. This method estimates 45,300 acre-feet/year (AFY) of streamflow, on average, enters the basin (about 6% of the annual mean precipitation). There are three main streams that drain the northern, central, and southern mountains; Nogal Creek, Three Rivers, and the Tularosa River (Fig. 8). Nogal Creek is an ephemeral stream whose headwaters are located on the eastern flank of Nogal Peak in the northern high mountains. As it descends from the moun- tain it curves north around Church Mountain and finally west before it discharges into the Carrizozo hilly plains. Several springs are loca- ted along the margins of the stream as it passes through the town of Nogal. Unfortunately, there is no stream gauge record to measure flow, though total flow is estimated to be approximately NEW MEXICO BUREAU OF GEOLOGY AND MINERAL RESOURCES 22 at the margin of all four topographical regions (NHM, SHM, CHP, TB). The only streamflow data pertaining to Three Rivers was collected from 1956 to 1977 by the USGS and only recorded peak flow (Livingston and Shomaker, 2006). Waltemeyer (2001) estimated 8300 AFY of total streamflow. The largest perennially flowing stream in the area is the Tularosa River. The Tularosa River flows southwest down the southern mountain front and through the town of Tularosa before infiltrating into the alluvial-basin aquifers. The headwaters of the stream originate in the can- yons on the Mescalero Apache Indian Reserva- tion in the northern Sacramento Mountains. Spring flow, derived largely from snowmelt, con- tributes a large part of the total flow (Garza and McLean, 1977). Several of the smaller tributaries contribute to the streamflow via runoff from monsoon rains. The Tularosa River is the only stream in the area with a currently functioning stream gauge.

Several of the smaller tributaries contribute to the streamflow via runoff from monsoon rains. The Tularosa River is the only stream in the area with a currently functioning stream gauge. Discharge measurements have been recorded since 1932. While the river flows year round at an average of 13.5 cubic feet per second (CFS) (9800 AFY), during monsoon rains the river has flooded to over 100 CFS (72,400 AFY). Stream- flow is historically lowest in June, averaging 11.0 CFS (8000 AFY). In August stream flow spikes to an average of 15.1 CFS (10,900 AFY) from monsoon runoff. A second, more sustained peak occurs in the winter between January and February as snowmelt and springs feed the river, averaging 14.6 CFS (10,600 AFY). Averaged discharge has fluctuated quite significantly throughout its 81 year record. From 1932\u20131947 the average flow was around 10,000 AFY. Between 1948 and 1977 flow was significantly lower, around 7000 AFY. Flow increased dramatically between 1978\u20131995, discharging approximately 16,000 AFY. From 1996 to present the river has been flowing on average around 10,000 AFY. Curiously, Walte- meyer\u2019s (2001) calculation of annual streamflow is significantly higher, estimating 17,500 AFY of streamflow from the Tularosa River drain- age basin. This inconsistency with measured vs. approximated flow highlights the rudimentary and rough estimation of the Basin-Climatic Characteristics Method. Two other ephemeral streams in the area, which Waltemeyer (2001) identified as providing significant streamflow to the Tularosa Basin are Temporal Creek and La Luz Creek. Temporal Creek, which flows from Rinconada Canyon is located between Three Rivers and the Tularosa River, is estimated to discharge 9200 AFY. La Luz Creek, located just south of the Tularosa River, is estimated to discharge at 5300 AFY. Groundwater Hydrogeologic Cross Sections A useful visual representation of the geologic structure of the study area is given in the cross sections of Figure 9, which represent a subset of the cross sections presented in Kelley et al. (2014) and Koning et al. (2014). These cross sections show the stratigraphic units that are dis- cussed below. Hydrostratigraphic Units The study area contains a diverse array of sedimentary and igneous rock units. Sedimen- tary units include carbonates (limestone and dolomite), evaporites (gypsum and anhydrite), and clastic sedimentary rocks (conglomerate, sandstone, siltstone, claystone) or their non-lith- ified, weakly consolidated counterparts (gravel, sand, silt, clay). Carbonates and evaporites are restricted to older marine rocks of the Paleozoic. Igneous rock units consist of lava flows and intrusions. Intrusions take the form of dikes, sills, and stocks. Below, we describe the rock units from old- est to youngest, with emphasis on properties that may control groundwater storage and flow. The rock units are grouped according to common lithologic properties that may affect groundwa- ter flow. A schematic stratigraphic section that illustrate Paleozoic, Mesozoic, and early Cenozoic strata is given in Figure 10. Please refer to Kelley et al. (2014) and Koning et al. (2014) for more detailed descriptions and genetic inter- pretations of the rock units.

Beeman (BEMN) and Holder (HLDR) Forma- tions (Pennsylvanian Period)\u2014The grayish Holder and underlying Beeman Formations are composed of shale and fossiliferous limestone with sparse beds of sandstone, mudstone, and limestone conglomerate (Fig. 10). These for- mations generally make poor aquifers, except where fractured. The combined thickness of these formations is approximately 230 to 425 m (750\u20131400 ft) (Otte, 1959). Bursum Formation (Pennsylvanian and Perm- ian Periods)\u2014The gray to red Bursum Forma- tion contains conglomerates interbedded with sandstone, fossiliferous limestone and shale (Fig. 10). Some of the discontinuous beds of sand- stone, conglomerate and fossiliferous limestone could be potential aquifers east and northeast of Tularosa. The Bursum Formation east of Tularosa is 170 to 300 m (560\u20131000 ft) thick, thickening from south to north (Otte, 1959). Abo Formation (Permian Period)\u2014The brick-red Abo Fomation is dominated by mudstone (50%) together with sandstone and conglomerate (40%) (Fig. 10). Fossiliferous limestone and car- bonate (10%) are primarily found in the basal 150 m (500 ft) of the unit (Otte, 1959). The discontinuous sandstones and conglomerates in the Abo Formation form localized aquifers east and northeast of Tularosa. The Abo is 430 to 550 m (1400\u20131800 ft) thick near Tularosa (Otte, 1959; Speer, 1983) and 530 to 630 m (1740\u2013 2070 ft) thick farther north in the subsurface near Three Rivers. Yeso Formation (Permian Period)\u2014The Yeso Formation can be divided into three parts in the study area. The exposed lower part consists of red and yellow siltstone, gray limestone, and thinly bedded gypsum (Fig. 10). A 30 m (100 ft) thick limestone is observed in the middle por- tion of the formation. Rocks of the upper part of the Yeso Formation include gypsum, limestone, and yellow to red siltstone. Fractured limestones serve as aquifers in the Yeso Formation. Dis- solution of gypsum locally creates sinkholes and deforms overlying rock units. The maximum thickness of this unit is 372 m (1200 ft) east- northeast of Tularosa, but it thickens to 610"

The maximum thickness of this unit is 372 m (1200 ft) east- northeast of Tularosa, but it thickens to 610 m (2000 ft) near Three Rivers. San Andres Formation (SNAN) (Permian Period)\u2014The San Andres Formation in the study area includes the Rio Bonito and Fourmile Draw Members (nomenclature adapted from the tripartite subdivision of the San Andres from Kelley, 1971) (Figs. 10, 11). The lower unit, the Rio Bonito Member, is 40\u201360 m (150\u2013200 ft) thick and consists largely of dark-gray limestone (Figs. 10, 11). The overlying Fourmile Draw Member is 177\u2013183 m (580\u2013600 ft) thick and composed of brownish gray, interbedded dolo- mite, limestone, and gypsum or anhydrite (Figs. 10, 11). The Glorieta Sandstone, which consti- tutes a good aquifer in central New Mexico, is not seen in the southern study area but to the north is present as one or two relatively thin beds, each <3 m (10 ft) thick, in the Rio Bonito Member. This sandstone is absent in the vicinity of Bent and is a single bed northeast of Tularosa. Based on surface exposures on the east flank of the Sacramento Mountains, the predominance of groundwater flow in the San Andres Formation is via fractures enlarged by dissolution. Maxwell Spring (TB-1010) in Temporal Canyon is associ- ated with faulted San Andres limestone (Fig. 12). Clastic Rocks (KTRP) (Permian, Triassic, and Cretaceous Periods)\u2014The Grayburg Formation is an easily eroded unit that consists of orangish- red, moderately cemented, fine-grained sand- stone, silty to clayey very fine- to fine-grained sandstone, and subordinate siltstone and shale (Fig. 12). In the southern compilation map area, thick gypsum or anhydrite beds are interbedded in these deposits. The Grayburg is about 105\u2013 110 m (~350\u2013360 ft) thick. No springs discharge from the Grayburg Formation and groundwater is inferred to flow interstitially or via fractures. The Moenkopi Formation in the study area is about 85\u2013105 m (290\u2013345 ft) thick (maxi- mum thickness from Lucas, 1991) and consists of reddish-brown, fine- to coarse-grained sandstone, mudstone, and 1\u20135% pebble- conglomerate.

The two mappable members of the San Andres Formation (Fourmile Draw and Rio Bonito) are well exposed on this steep slope 1.8 km (1.1 mi) in the Temporal Creek drainage. Note their gray color and ledge-forming outcrop character. Where seen here, both of the members are mostly composed of carbonate rocks (with the Rio Bonito predominately composed of limestone), but the Fourmile Draw Member contains interbedded gypsum or anhydrite beds as well. Below lies the Yeso Formation, which is more of a slope-former than the San Andres Formation. B. A faulted contact between the Fourmile Draw Member of the San Andres Formation (Psf) and the Grayburg Formation of the Artesia Group (Pag); photo taken 14.5 km (9 mi) southeast of Three Rivers. The light tan strata in the Fourmile Draw Member consist of gypsum and the darker bands are composed of dolomite or limestone B A northeastern tularosa basin region 27 Moenkopi are well-cemented and groundwater flow is probably through fractures. No springs discharge from the Moenkopi Formation and its well-cemented sandstones and clayey floodplain deposits may impede groundwater flow. The Dakota Sandstone is relatively thin (30\u201350 m (100\u2013170 ft) thick), generally com- posed of fine- to very coarse-grained sandstone, and is very well cemented (Fig. 12). Up-section, beds of siltstone, very fine-grained to fine-grained sandstone, and shale-mudstone become increas- ingly common. Because of its well-cemented nature, there is likely minimal interstitial (between sand grains) groundwater flow in the Dakota Sandstone. Rather, flow is probably through fractures/joints or via bedding planes, as seems to be the case for the spring at Bull Gap (TB-1038) (K. Zeigler, pers. commun., 2011). West of Oscuro, the western spring asso- ciated with Phillips Springs (TB-1047) discharges from the Dakota Sandstone. Marine Shales (MNCS) (Late Cretaceous Period)\u2014This succession of shale-dominated rocks thickens to the north. The unit includes two tongues of the gray to yellow Mancos Shale, the lower being 100\u2013120 m (330\u2013380 ft) thick and the upper being 90\u2013140 m (310\u2013450 ft) thick. The two shale tongues are separated by a 20\u201330 m-thick (70\u2013100 ft-thick) tongue of sandstone-dominated strata (the Tres Hermanos Formation) (Fig. 10).

NEW MEXICO BUREAU OF GEOLOGY AND MINERAL RESOURCES 28 increasingly common in the upper half of the upper tongue (Fig. 12). Because of its clay-rich lithology, the Mancos Shale hosts relatively few springs and likely functions as an aquitard. One spring in the Mancos Shale is Aguilar Spring (TB-1029), which discharges from a fault 7.5 km (4.7 mi) southeast of Three Rivers. A spring (now dry) once discharged from the Tres Hermanos Formation at a location 5.8 km (3.6 mi) southwest of the Carrizozo airport. The existence of this spring is noteworthy as it indicates that the Tres Hermanos Sandstone can act as a confined aquifer within the adjoining Mancos aquitard.

A D B E C F northeastern tularosa basin region 29 of Black Mountain. These include Scotts Spring, alongside Highway 380 west of Carrizozo, and Anchor Spring, located 1.2 mi (2 km) west of the Carrizozo airport. A line of seeps extends 490 m (1600 ft) north of Anchor Spring, paral- lel to bedding strike, and the northern seeps discharge ~15 stratigraphic meters (~50 ft) below outcrops of Gallup Sandstone, indicating a strong component of interstitial flow or bedding plane flow in confined, stratal conditions. Several springs occur in narrow canyons incised deeply into the Gallup Sandstone 7 km (4.5 km) southeast of Three Rivers, at the western foot of Black Mountain. The entire Crevasse Canyon Formation is 530\u2013760 m (1750\u20132500 ft) thick, the lower half of which is included in this lower-permeability unit. The basal 30\u201390 m (100\u2013300 ft) of the Crevasse Canyon Formation is transitional stratigraphic unit because of laterally extensive, several meter-thick shale tongues in the former and the fact that the latter is mostly composed of low-permeability, fine-grained flood-plain deposits (Fig. 14). Collectively, these fine-grained deposits likely act to retard groundwater flow and may result in low hydraulic conductivity values for this unit. The Gallup Sandstone con- sists of laterally extensive tongues of white to yellow sandstone separated by subordinate gray shale. The sandstone is weakly to well cemented, with cemented intervals common near large volcanic intrusions (e.g., White Oaks area and west side of Willow Hills) (Fig. 14). The Gallup Sandstone is 105\u2013195 m thick (350\u2013640 ft thick), being thickest in the White Oaks area. Springs discharging from the Gallup Sand- stone are limited to the Carrizozo area and west NEW MEXICO BUREAU OF GEOLOGY AND MINERAL RESOURCES 30 with the underlying Gallup Sandstone. In the lower Crevasse Canyon Formation, the sandstone is generally yellow, very fine- to medium-grained, and commonly deposited within former river channels. Floodplain sediment between the sandy channel-fills is characterized by mudstone or clayey-silty very fine- to fine-grained sandstone. Coal or carbona- ceous mudstone beds may be found as inter- beds in swamp- or floodplain-mudstone in the lower half of the Crevasse Canyon Formation (Fig. 14). Lower Coyote Spring (TB-1027) and Bloom Spring discharge from the lower Crevasse Canyon Formation, ~3 km (~2 mi) southwest of the Carrizozo airport, and outcrop observations suggest stratal-controlled discharge from sandstone under confined conditions (Fig. 12). Clastic rocks (TKSCC) (Late Cretaceous Period and Eocene Epoch)\u2014These units include the upper Crevasse Canyon, Cub Mountain, and Sanders Canyon Formations. The thickness of the hydrostratigraphic unit ranges from 800 to 1160 m (2600 to 3800 ft) (Fig. 10). A 3\u20138 m-thick (10\u201326 ft-thick) zone of strong cementation lies at the boundary between the Crevasse Canyon and Cub Mountain Forma- tions, coinciding with a paleosol. Strata are characterized by interbedded sandstone channel- fills and lower permeability floodplain deposits composed of mudstone and very fine- to fine- grained sandstone (Fig. 15). Floodplain deposits are subequal to or subordinate to sandstone channel-fills, which are fine- to coarse-grained and locally contain pebble beds (Fig. 15).

Clastic rocks (TKSCC) (Late Cretaceous Period and Eocene Epoch)\u2014These units include the upper Crevasse Canyon, Cub Mountain, and Sanders Canyon Formations.

These rock units are weakly to well-cemented, with the upper 100\u2013300 m (300\u20131000 ft) generally weakly cemented. Springs are common in sandstone intervals (e.g., Milagro (TB-1011), Jakes, and Shady Springs (TB-1034)) and outcrop observations indicate bedding plane, fracture, and interstitial ground- water flow (Koning et al., 2014). We infer a relatively high hydraulic conductivity value for this unit based on the high proportion of chan- nel-fills, thick intervals of weak cementation, and the relative abundance of springs. Sierra Blanca Volcanic Field (SBV) (late Paleo- gene Period)\u2014Because igneous rocks underlie high topography in the Sierra Blanca highland and Carrizo Mountain, groundwater recharge in the northern study area occurs in these rock types and thus their hydrologic properties are important to consider (Figs. 6a, 10, 16). Except for the White Oaks area and Carrizo Mountain, practically all the igneous rocks in the study area relate to the Sierra Blanca volcanic field. Sierra Blanca volcanic rocks and volcanic- lastic sediment\u2014Up to 1400 m (4600 ft) of inter- bedded volcanic sedimentary rocks composed of volcanic detritus are preserved in the deepest part of the Sierra Blanca basin (i.e., beneath the Sierra Blanca highland). Recent geologic map- ping has greatly refined the volcanic stratigraphy and has differentiated the Walker Group of Thompson (1966, 1972) into the Hog Pen and Three Rivers Formations (Fig. 10)(Kelley et al., 2014; Koning et al., 2014; Kelley et al., in press). For the purposes of this investigation, however, the volcanic lithologic units are treated as a single hydrostratigraphic unit. The volcanic rocks are mostly alkalic andesite lavas, with minor alkalic basalt, dacite, and rhyolite flows.

The sedimentary rocks consist of gray to red, well- cemented sandy conglomerate and clayey-pebbly sandstone derived from eroded lava flows (Fig. 16). Springs are common in volcanic rocks in the Sierra Blanca high country and feed perennial streams in the Ruidoso area. Springs are locally found in canyons that drain the lower western slopes. Spring locations in the Sierra Blanca highland commonly coincide with flow breccias at the bottoms or tops of lava flows (Fig. 16).

The dikes originally consisted of hornblende- and biotite-bearing trachyte but have been significantly altered by hot water after their emplacement (hence the orange oxidation colors). Note how the hydrothermal waters did not notably alter the Mancos Shale, which still retains its gray color. Rather, the flow of the hydrothermal waters, and resulting alteration, appears to have been restricted to the dikes because the dikes were more permeable than the Mancos Shale. northeastern tularosa basin region 33 understanding groundwater flow. Fractures in large intrusive bodies, such as those underlying Sierra Blanca Peak, appear to extend at least hundreds of meters (>1000 ft) in some areas and probably facilitate deep recharge. Meinzer and Hare (1915) noted that sills in the Carrizozo area acted as groundwater aquitards, with the groundwater table forming step-like geometries (in a profile view) over a given sill. Field observations from recent geologic mapping efforts indicate a less simplistic view of the roles of sills and dikes in groundwater flow (Koning et al., 2014). Fractured dikes and sills may act as preferential groundwater pathways when surrounding strata is of relatively low permeability, such as in the Mancos Shale. An example is Kitty Spring (TB-1009), which flows directly out of fractures in a >50 m- (>160 ft)- thick sill that intruded Mancos Shale (Fig. 18). However, dikes and sills appear to act as groundwater barriers or aquitards where hosted by hydrostratigraphic units with higher hydraulic conductivities. This is seen at Milagro Springs (TB-1011), which flows out of the upper Crevasse Canyon Formation immediately up-gradient of a sill-dike complex (Koning et al., 2014). In addition, the northern limit of seeps associated with Anchor Spring, located 4 km west of Carrizozo, is clearly controlled by the presence of a northwest-trending dike (Koning et al., 2014). Basin-fill (QTBF) (late Paleogene through Quaternary Periods)\u2014The basin-fill unit inclu- des weakly to well consolidated, non-to strongly cemented sediment that fills the Tularosa Basin and underlies most of the Carrizozo hilly plain region (Fig. 14). Basin-fill is thickest in the Tularosa Basin, where it is likely as old as late Oligocene at depth. Basin-fill is 900\u20131200 m (3000\u20134000 ft) thick in the Tularosa area (Peterson and Roy, 2005; Healy et al., 1978; Orr and Myers, 1986) but likely thins northward. Inspection of well data in the Tularosa and Alamogordo areas indicates that the basin-fill contains an upper, 30\u2013140 m-thick (100\u2013450 ft- thick), coarser subunit that overlies a somewhat finer-grained subunit (Fig. 9). Both the lower and upper subunits become finer-grained with increasing distance from the mountain front (Fig. 9). Sand and gravel domi- nate within 1\u20132 km (0.6\u20131.2 mi) of the mountain front. Westward, tongues of sand and gravel (amalgamated channel-fills) occur within clayey-silty fine sand and the extent and number of these tongues likely decrease in a basinward direction. Groundwater preferentially flows in these coarse-grained tongues and they have greater groundwater yields (Shomaker, 2005, unpublished consultant report on the La Luz well field). High permeability, eolian sand units are likely in the subsurface in the Three Rivers area and west of Tularosa.

It is differentiated from basin-fill where it underlies the floors of relatively narrow, <0.5 km (0.3 mi) wide valleys. Figure 20\u2013Location of springs inventoried in the study area, along with what sample analysis was preformed. northeastern tularosa basin region 35 Springs Springs are the primary source of water for many streams in the area that drain into the Tularosa Basin. Seventy springs were inventoried in this study, of which thirty-five were sampled (Fig. 4, 12). Spring discharge rates are generally low, less than 0.013 cfs (6 gallons per minute (gpm)), however, there are five that have dis- charge more than 0.22 cfs (100 gpm). Spring discharge rates were measured using a bucket and stopwatch method, or estimated by eye. Whereas on the eastern side of the Sacramento Mountains the vast majority of springs were confined to the high mountains (80% above 7400 ft), springs on the western side are more evenly dispersed (80% above 5200 ft). The majority of the springs are located in the high mountains and hilly plains regions; 40% in the NHM, 30% in the SHM, and 27% in the CHP (Fig. 21). The geologic unit with the highest density of springs is the volcanic rocks found in the NHM (29%); the Yeso Formation in the SHM has the next highest number of inventoried springs (19%). Twenty percent of the springs discharge from Quaternary alluvium and are evenly dispersed in the northern high mountains and Carrizozo hilly plains (Table 2). The emergence of springs is heavily con- trolled by the geology of the area, typically discharging above impervious units, or from fractures in bedrock. Springs in Sierra Blanca volcanic rocks typically have higher flow rates. Presumably the highly fractured nature of the volcanics contributes to the abundance and greater discharge rate of springs in this area.

There are numerous seeps west of Carrizozo which are clearly controlled by the presence of a northwest-trending dike and discharge from the clastic rocks of the Late Cretaceous Period and Eocene epoch (Koning et al., 2014). Fractures and faults in other lithologic units also play a key role in where springs emerge. These fractures allow groundwater to flow freely through the rock with little resistance. The largest spring in the area, Maxwell Spring (TB-1010), discharges near a fault in the Yeso Formation, which flows at roughly 6.7 cfs (3000 gpm) (E. Ranney, pers. commun., 2009). Also of note is Carrizozo Spring (TB-1037), located just north of Carrizozo. This spring is unique in that it creates a local groundwater high point. Carrizozo spring discharges from Ceno- zoic basin-fill (QTBF), though it is likely flowing under artesian conditions from a deeper, older groundwater source. Primary Aquifers The primary source of groundwater varies greatly throughout the study area. In the Tularosa Basin, based on lithologic logs in water wells, the Cenozoic basin-fill (QTBF) is the primary source of groundwater (Fig. 9). This unit is made up of coarse unconsolidated streambed sediments and valley fill, mainly cobbles, sand, and silt, making it a very produc- tive aquifer where saturated. The average depth to water in wells sampled in the Tularosa Basin is 55 m (180 ft) on average. Basin-fill is 900\u20131200 m (3000\u20134000 ft) thick in the Tularosa area (Peterson and Roy, 2005; Healy et al., 1978; Orr and Myers, 1986). Aquifer tests show that values of transmissivity vary greatly throughout the unit, ranging from 50 to 3000 ft2/day (Garza and McLean, 1977; Orr and Myers, 1986; Morrison, 1989). As distance from the mountain front increases, the basin-fill is generally composed of finer grained, less perme- able material. While it is generally treated as an unconfined aquifer, interbedded clay layers lead to partially confined conditions throughout the aquifer. To the north in the Carrizozo hilly plains there are several available aquifers which are utilized, the most common being the Eocene- Cretaceous sediments (TKSCC), Gallup Sandstone (GLUP), Sierra Blanca volcanics (SBV), and Cenozoic basin-fill (QTBF) (Fig. 9). The average depth to water in the area is 22 m (71 ft). The majority of wells (34%) are screened in TKSCC relatively coarse-grained strata (Table 2). These include the Sanders Canyon Formation, Cub Mountain Formation, and the upper part of the Crevasse Canyon Formation. These strata are characterized by interbedded sandstone channel-fills and flood plain deposits, and are weakly to well cemented.

Springs are common in sandstone intervals (e.g., Milagro (TB-1011), Jakes, and Shady Springs (TB-1034)) and field observations indicate that bedding plane, fracture, and interstitial groundwater flow occurs (Koning et al., 2014). We infer a relatively high transmissivity value of 90 ft2/day for this unit based pumping tests (Rau, 1986; Finch, 2001), the high proportion of channel-fills, thick intervals of weak cementation, and the relative abundance of springs. The Sierra Blanca/Sacramento Mountain front to the east of the Tularosa Basin has the highest number of springs in the area, and the fewest wells. In this report the mountains are divided into two sections; the northern and southern high mountains. Sixty percent of wells in the NHM are screened in the Sierra Blanca volcanic rocks and sediment. The median depth northeastern tularosa basin region 37 to water is relatively shallow, roughly 21 m (69 ft) deep. These igneous rocks are permeable only where they are fractured, and they generally yield only small amounts of water to wells. This makes it difficult to make estimations for flow from these volcanic aquifers to the basin floor. The main way in which this unit is believed to contribute to the basin is via springs which dis- charge into streams that flow to the valley floor. The aquifers available west of the escarp- ment in the Sacramento Mountains are different from the eastern side studied by Newton et al. (2012). Wells in the southern high mountains (SHM) are primarily (47%) completed in the Abo Formation. The Abo formation is com- posed of fluvial deposits dominated by mud- stone, as well as sandstone and conglomerate. The discontinuous sandstone and conglomerates in the Abo Formation form localized aquifers. The median depth to water in this area is 27 m (87 ft). While the Abo Formation is not the most productive aquifer, it is the most prevalent in the region west of the escarpment. This is in contrast to the Sacramento Mountain report (Newton et al., 2012), which found the Yeso Formation to be the primary aquifer east of the escarpment. Groundwater Flow Conditions To understand groundwater flow within and surrounding the northeastern Tularosa Basin region, a water elevation surface was devel- oped (Fig. 22; Land et al., 2014). Contours of the regional water-level elevation in the study area were drawn by hand based on water-level measurements made between 2009 and 2011. Water-level elevations from wells were combined with spring elevations and valley floor elevations. Where these data were not available, static water levels were used from recent New Mexico Office of the State Engineer well records (Appendix 2). No attempt was made to distinguish between perched and regional aquifers. The hydrologic gradient was estimated by measuring the dis- tance between the water-level contours. The general trend that can be seen from the water- level contours is that groundwater flows is driven by the topographic gradient from high to low elevation (Fig. 22), or from east to west. The complex geology of the area plays a major role in groundwater flow patterns. In the southeastern portion of the study area, the SHM are composed of Paleozoic sedimentary rocks, while the NHM are dominated by younger Neogene volcanics. Running north-south, to the west of the mountains, is the Alamogordo fault. This is a normal fault and it is responsible for the down-dropped basin floor, which resulted in a steep mountain front compared with the more gently dipping strata on the eastern side of the southern Sacramento Mountains (Newton et al., 2012). These geologic conditions lead us to classify the western flank of the mountains as a Mountain-Front Recharge zone. Because of the steep slope the majority of the precipitation that falls on the western side of the mountains does not infiltrate into the aquifers, as it does on the eastern side. Instead, precipitation results in runoff that quickly drains into the Tularosa Basin, as Mountain-Front Recharge (MFR). MFR is a predominant source of recharge to basins in arid and semiarid regions, however it is also very difficult to quantify (Wilson and Guan, 2004). Uncertainty stems from climate variability, anthropogenic distur- bances, and the geologic complexity often associ- ated with these conditions. Evidence of MFR can be seen by water table mounding near the mouths of drainage basins. This effect can be seen most clearly in the Three Rivers drainage and where it discharges into the Tularosa Basin. In the upper reaches of Three Rivers the water table is sloping toward the river, creating a \u201cV\u201d shape which points up gradient, indicating that water from the surrounding rocks drains into the river (Fig. 23). This section of the river is classified as a gaining system, which is reinforced by the springs which discharge along the incised river bed. As the river enters the basin, however, the water table is inverted and points down gradient, creating a mound- ing effect (also seen on Fig. 9). This change in gradient indicates that water from the stream is now infiltrating into the aquifer, and is identified as a losing system. The transition occurs just as the river crosses the Alamogordo fault and flows over the more conductive basin-fill sediments. Groundwater flow in the NHM is heavily influenced by the volcanic intrusions. Volcanic Figure 22A\u2013Water table surface map for the northeastern region of the Tularosa Basin.

As the river enters the basin, however, the water table is inverted and points down gradient, creating a mound- ing effect (also seen on Fig. 9). This change in gradient indicates that water from the stream is now infiltrating into the aquifer, and is identified as a losing system. The transition occurs just as the river crosses the Alamogordo fault and flows over the more conductive basin-fill sediments. Groundwater flow in the NHM is heavily influenced by the volcanic intrusions. Volcanic Figure 22A\u2013Water table surface map for the northeastern region of the Tularosa Basin. Average water-level elevation contours (in feet) show the regional groundwater movement is controlled by topography. Groundwater flows from the eastern escarpment to the lower elevations to the west. Contours do not distinguish between perched and regional aquifers. The actual direction of groundwater flow at a local scale, particularly in the high mountains, may differ from that indicated by the regional elevation contours due to lithologic heterogeneities, the presence of regional faulting and intrusions, and variations in topographic relief.

NEW MEXICO BUREAU OF GEOLOGY AND MINERAL RESOURCES 40 rocks make very poor aquifers as spaces between the individual mineral crystals of igneous rocks are microscopically small, few, and generally unconnected; therefore, porosity is insignificant. These igneous rocks are permeable only where they are fractured, and they generally yield only small amounts of water to wells. Where wells intersect a fracture, however, they can be highly productive. Nogal Creek, which drains the igneous rocks of the Sierra Blanca highlands, is an ephemeral stream that flows into the CHP. To the east of Carrizozo there is a north-south trending normal fault that results in a sudden increase in depth of the permeable aquifer under Carrizozo. This permeable unit pinches out just west of Carrizozo as the less permeable aquifers slope up to the surface (Fig. 9a). As a result, this fault is responsible for a very shallow and flat water table at the mouth of the Nogal Creek drainage under Carrizozo (Fig. 22). In SHM on the eastern side of the Sacramento Mountains escarpment, water flows eastward toward the Pecos Slope through the Permian age Yeso Formation (Newton et al., 2012). On the western escarpment, however, water flows through the Pennsylvanian and Permian age units (ABO, BRSM, HLDR, BEMN, GBLR) (Fig. 9d). The water table slopes steeply to the west, with a hydraulic gradient of roughly 350 feet/mile at higher elevations. This steep gradient reflects the very low conductivity of the Paleozoic sedimentary rocks which make up the SHM. The fractured nature of these units coupled with very few hydraulic conductiv- ity measurements makes it difficult to estimate groundwater flux through the mountain-block. The water table flattens out dramatically as it crosses the Alamogordo fault. On the western side of the down-dropped fault is the basin-fill aquifer, which has a significantly higher hydraulic conductivity. All of these factors contribute to the water table\u2019s low gradient of roughly 30 feet/ mile in the basin (Fig. 22). Water-Level Changes and Hydrographs To better understand the hydrodynamics and physical properties of the various aquifers we looked for patterns in the changes in water levels in wells and how they relate to different aquifers and topographic settings. Records were collected with continuous data loggers in ten wells, and bimonthly from approximately 100 wells between August 2009 and July 2011. These records show Figure 24\u2013Bar graph showing the percent of wells within of each hydrograph trend by topographic location.

Pumping Trend Tularosa and Alamogordo have experienced extensive groundwater pumping over the past 100 years. Hydrographs from pumping wells closely follow the agricultural cycle of the area. The wells that show a pumping signal are most often located in the Tularosa Basin, at an average elevation of 1387 m (4550 ft). Depth to water in these wells is on average 53 m (175 ft) below ground surface. The majority of pumping trend wells (80%) are screened in basin-fill (QTBF). When the growing season starts and farm- ers begin to water their fields, the water levels decrease from their highest point in March. Water levels decrease throughout the rest of the summer months, reaching their lowest point in September. The majority of the drawdown seems to occur in the spring. The monsoonal rains begin in July, resulting in less groundwater pumping. As a result, the water levels decline more slowly with additional variation in the hydrographs near the end of the growing cycle. In September, when the growing season ends, the pumps are shut off and the water level quickly rebounds through December and begins to level out by March, before pumping resumes once again (Fig. 26). On average, there is 1.2 m (4 ft) of fluctuation between maximum drawdown and recovery, though the maximum rebound during the study period was 3.7 m (12 ft). Sixty-three percent of pumping hydrographs show ground- water depletion, meaning groundwater levels did not fully recover from 2009 to 2010, with an average deficit of 9 cm (0.3 ft).

Com- parison of the water levels in these wells with Figure 25\u2013Map indicating the location of wells that were used in the hydrograph analysis, with corresponding trend. Locations of example hydrograph trends (Fig. 26) are enlarged. NEW MEXICO BUREAU OF GEOLOGY AND MINERAL RESOURCES 42 the atmospheric pressure recorded at the ground surface reveals an inverse relationship (i.e. when the atmo- spheric pressure rises, the water level in the well drops) (e.g. Fig. 27). In both wells the magnitude of the water level change is about two-thirds of the atmospheric changes. This indi- cates the aquifer in which these wells are screened is confined. An aquifer that is confined has a less permeable layer above and below it. As result, water cannot move up or down from the confined unit. Determining that the aquifer is confined tells us that recharge likely does not occur in the vicinity of the well. Water instead enters the aquifer some distance away in the high mountain recharge areas or at the alluvial fans in the foot of the mountain front. Recharge Trend Recharge trends are defined by hydrographs that show monsoonal precipitation or snowmelt (Fig. 26) entering the aquifer, leading to a rise in water levels. This can be very difficult to determine as the water level rise associated with recharge occurs at roughly the same time as the rebound period in pumping wells. Wells which show recharge are typi- cally completed in hydrostratigraphic units TKSCC (22%) and SBV (26%). In general, wells that demonstrate recharge are at higher elevations, with 80% greater than 1830 m (6000 ft), and depth to water is relatively shallow, averaging 23 m (75 ft). Wells along the upper Nogal Creek responded strongly to the heavier snow fall during the winter of 2009\u2013 2010, with steep water level rises of approximately 3 m (10 ft) on average over a 3 month period (Fig. 26). The proximity of the wells to Nogal Creek suggests they are closely linked to the baseflow in the stream. The abrupt rise, coupled with the equally Figure 26\u2013Examples of the four major trends seen in well water levels throughout the study period: recharge, pumping, decline, and no change. Figure 27\u2013Comparison of the water levels with the atmospheric pressure recorded at some wells reveals an inverse relationship-when the atmospheric pressure rises, the water level in the well drops and vise versa.

As opposed to the wells near Nogal that show snowmelt recharge, the well field in the vicinity of Carrizozo also has a significant number of recharge wells that react to monsoon precipita- tion (TB-097, 101, 113, etc) (Fig. 25). This is likely the result of runoff from the Nogal arroyo recharging the aquifer. These wells show a more attenuated recharge signal, generally no more than 0.6 m (2 ft) of rise. No Change Trend The hydrogeology of the Sierra Blanca moun- tain front is very complicated owing to the vast number of faults and heterogeneous lithologies throughout the area. As a result, water-level trends are quite varied, and do not always fluctuate in a predictable fashion. Wells that fluctuate less than 0.3 m (1 ft) per year are defined as \u201cno change trend\u201d (Fig. 26). This trend makes up 30% of the recorded hydrographs in the study area (Fig. 25). The majority of wells which show no change are completed in the Gallup Sandstone (21%), and are located pri- marily in the Carrizozo hilly plains. Decline Trend Hydrographs with decline trends are charac- terized by greater than 0.3 m (1 ft) of decline per year (Fig. 26). The average water level drop per year in the decline wells is 1.3 m (4.3 ft), though there is one outlier that declined 21 m (68 ft) (TB-223, excluded from calculation). This trend makes up just 11% of the hydrographs. Wells that have a decline trend are scattered through- out the study area, though the highest density is in the north, around the Nogal drainage. Water Chemistry For this study, we examined several different chemical components of the groundwater, and performed several measurements in the field.

Figure 28\u2013Map of specific conductivity measurements from field sampling locations, showing springs and wells. northeastern tularosa basin region 45 Field Measurements Using field instruments, we measured parameters including pH, temperature, and specific conductance prior to collecting a water sample. As shown in Table 4, for all samples, the pH ranges from 6.4 to 8.3, residing in a fairly neutral pH range. The temperature of springs is generally cool, from 4.2 to 28.9\u00b0C (4.2\u201384\u00b0F) with a mean of 14.3\u00b0C (57.7\u00b0F). Well water samples ranged from 10.4 to 28\u00b0C (50.7\u201382.4\u00b0F), with a mean of 18.2\u00b0C (64.8\u00b0F). Streams range from 9.4 to 25.7\u00b0C (48.9\u201378.3\u00b0F), with a mean of 17.7\u00b0C (63.9\u00b0F). One simple way to examine the ion content of a water sample is with a measurement of the specific conductance (SC). SC measured in springs ranges from 80 to 6164 \u00b5S/cm, with an average of 1949 \u00b5S/cm. In well samples, we found SC values in the range of 834 to 5289 \u00b5S/cm, but with a higher mean of 2383 \u00b5S/ cm. Streams range from 560 to 5325 \u00b5S/ cm, with the lowest mean of 1584 \u00b5S/cm. Springs and wells (Fig. 28), in the high mountains generally have lower SC, and therefore lower ion content. In general the water in this region, except for high in the mountains, has fairly high levels of ion content, making the water very mineralized. This is often observed as elevated \u201cwater hardness.\u201d In this region, the water hardness (lab calc., summarized in Appendix 7) ranges from 28 mg/L in the high mountain springs, to 3451 mg/L in lower elevation locations. The average hardness in this region is 1163 mg/L, which is extremely hard. Major Ion Chemistry and Water Type The ion chemistry of groundwater in this region is variable. Calcium is the dominant cation in most of the water samples col- lected, followed by magnesium and then sodium, in various combinations. The dominant anion in this area is sulfate, with chloride to a lesser extent. The water chem- istry can be summarized spatially with Stiff diagrams and with a Piper plot, as shown Figure 29\u2013Map showing locations and results of sampled water chemistry using Stiff diagrams. Stiff diagrams graphically show the dominant cation and anion concentrations for each spring and well sampled in this study, as depicted in the inserted diagram. NEW MEXICO BUREAU OF GEOLOGY AND MINERAL RESOURCES 46 in Figures 29 and 30. The water type designa- tions are also included in the data tables in Appendix 7. Looking at the Stiff plots on the map in Figure 29, we see a similar trend as with SC, showing that water samples in the high moun- tains regions have lower concentrations of ions. Waters from springs and wells sampled in the southern region of the study area, especially in lower elevations of the basin tend to have higher concentrations, as observed by the larger Stiff symbols with high levels of calcium, sulfate and chloride. In the northern portion of the study area, around Carrizozo, the Stiff symbols are thinner, indicating lower concentrations of ions. Looking at the ion chemistry in terms of the spatial trends of calcium and sulfate (Fig. 31a, b), we see a similar pattern. With a few exceptions, we observe lower levels of calcium and sulfate in the high mountains regions, with highest levels in the southern, low elevation region of the study. Relative to the southern area, the northern region around Carrizozo has low concentrations of calcium and sulfate. Figure 31c shows the spatial dis- tribution of silica concentration. In this map, the concentrations are higher in the northern region, with the opposite of the spatial trend of calcium and sulfate.

Controls on Water Chemistry The influence of regional geologic variations on water chemistry is apparent. As ground- water interacts with rocks in the subsurface, the ion content and trace metal chemistry of the water can change. This is dependent on a number of factors, including rock type, water temperature and pH, and the amount of time the water spends within the rocks. Groundwater flow through carbonates and evaporites influences the water chemistry we observe throughout the region (Fig. 31a, b). These units include the San Andres and Yeso Formations. In the northern areas, where more volcanic rocks are present, water chemistry reflects silicate weathering with higher con- centrations of silica in the groundwater (Fig. 31c). Figure 32 shows that the weathering of 20 40 40 40 60 20 40 60 80 80 Calcium Chloride Magnesium Carbonate + Bicarbonate Sodium + Potassium Sulfate 20 20 20 40 60 60 60 80 80 80 20 0 0 0 0 40 60 100 100 0 0 100 0 100 100 0 100 Chloride + Sulfate Calcium + Magnesium SHM NHM TB CHP Streams TDS proportional value Figure 30\u2013Piper diagram shows percentage of ion content in spring, well and stream samples in the regions of NHM, SHM, TB and CHP.

Other plots, such as shown in Figure 33b, indicate dis- solution of gypsum, calcite and dolomite, which indicates that carbonate dissolution from lime- stone is the dominant process influencing the water chemistry. In order to assess the possibility of chloride- rich brines mixing with fresh groundwater, we examined the sodium (Na) to chloride (Cl) molar ratio in the groundwater samples. In Figure 34a, many samples have nearly a 1:1 ratio of Na/Cl dissolution of halite (salt). Samples with more carbonates is dominant, but silicate weathering is more common in some of the northern regions where volcanic material is more prevalent. If the molar ratio of bicarbonate to silica is greater than ten it implies that carbonate weathering predominates. However, if the ratio is less than five, then silicate weathering predominates (Hounslow, 1995). The observations of spatial trends in water chemistry are highly correlated to the geology and the flow path that the ground- water follows through the subsurface. The chemistry data also indicates that many of the sampled waters have undergone cation exchange.

Stable Isotopes of Hydrogen and Oxygen Because all groundwater and surface water in the study area is derived from precipitation in the Sacramento Mountains, it is important to characterize the stable isotopic composition of local precipitation. Figure 35 shows locations of precipitation collection sites, which were distributed throughout the study area at a range of elevations (Table 5). The linear regression of stable isotope data from precipitation defines a local meteoric water line (LMWL) for the west- ern slopes of the Sacramento Mountains (Fig. 36) with an equation of: \u03b4D = 7.9\u03b418 O + 10.8 This equation is almost identical to the global meteoric water line defined by Craig (1961). It should be noted that the three points with positive \u03b418O values were not used for the linear regression that defines the LMWL. These points represent samples collected in June 2011, and the isotopic compositions clearly indicate that this water has undergone significant evaporation, which likely occurred as rain drops descended through the atmosphere. There- fore, the observed isotopic compositions of these three samples do not represent the isotopic composition of atmospheric water at that time. The seasonal variability of the isotopic composition of precipitation is shown in the shaded areas of the LMWL (Fig. 36) as winter precipitation, which is a mixture of rain and snow that fell between December and March and summer precipitation, which is primarily monsoon rains that occur between June and September. Variations in the stable isotopic composition of precipitation are probably due to two seasonal factors (Rozanski et al., 1993): 1) changing temperature and 2) changing source areas of vapor and/or different storm trajectories. In this area, the average temperature difference between summer and winter is approximately 15\u00b0C (59\u00b0F). The domi- nant source area of winter storms is the Pacific Ocean, while summer storms associated with the North American Monsoon originate from the Point ID Altitude (ft) Date Installed Date Removed TB-2001 6565.84 6/12/2009 9/1/2011 TB-2002 4505.58 6/12/2009 9/1/2011 TB-2003 4982.00 6/11/2009 9/1/2011 TB-2004 5248.48 6/11/2009 9/1/2011 TB-2005 6300.60 6/11/2009 9/1/2011 TB-2006 7774.96 6/11/2009 9/1/2011 Table 5\u2013Site elevations and periods of precipitation collection.

An elevation effect on the isotopic composition of precipitation was not observed. No other spatial trends were observed. The stable isotopic compositions of well and spring samples collected in the study area can help to identify recharge areas, assess recharge mechanisms, and characterize groundwater flow paths. For this discussion, we will divide the study area into southern and northern regions (Similar to division on maps in Fig. 4). Figure 37 shows the stable isotopic compositions for wells, springs and streams in the southern region of the study area, which includes the TB and the SHM regions. It can be seen that most points plot below the LMWL, indicating that this water has undergone evaporation to some degree. How- ever, the data are highly variable and do not indi- cate a single linear trend. It is likely that the iso- topic compositions of most of these well, spring, and stream samples are due to evaporation of water with different initial isotopic composi- tions. The hypothetical evaporation line shown, which can explain some of the data, intersects the LMWL at the very top of the region where winter precipitation usually plots, indicating that this original water was winter precipitation. Most other data, which plot between this evapo- ration line and the LMWL, can be explained by other evaporation lines (not shown) with original isotopic compositions that are typical of summer precipitation. Other data points plot on the LMWL in the range of values expected for summer precipitation. These data suggest that most groundwater recharge actually originates as summer precipitation. The observed high vari- ability in isotopic compositions in groundwater indicates a complex system where recharge occurs at different rates in different areas. Additionally, it suggests that flow paths in different areas are isolated from each other. Although it appears that most water undergoes evaporation, either in the shallow soil or mountain streams before recharg- ing the groundwater system, some water (whose isotopic composition plots along the LMWL) has made it into the hydrologic system quickly enough to avoid evaporation. Stable isotopic data for springs, streams, and wells in the northern portion of the study area, which includes the NHM and the CHP, exhibit similar trends as those observed to the south (Fig. 38). Much of the data plots below the LMWL, and therefore indicate that these waters have undergone evaporation to some degree. Figure 38 shows two possible evaporation lines, one of which intersects the LMWL within the transition zone between areas where summer and winter precipitation usually plots. The other evaporation line intersects the LMWL in the region where summer precipitation generally plots. Many springs in the northern high mountains plot on the LMWL with summer precipitation values. Again, these data suggest that most, but not all water has undergone evaporation in the shallow Figure 37\u2013Stable isotopic compositions of water samples collected from wells, springs,"

The apparent presence of multiple evaporative trends indicates that indi- vidual groundwater flow paths are not intercon- nected on a large scale, thus waters are not well mixed. As observed in the stable isotope data in the southern portion of the study area, summer precipitation appears to be the primary source of groundwater recharge. However, there are several springs that plot near the LMWL with isotopi- cally light values typical of winter precipitation. All of these springs are located at high elevations near Sierra Blanca. The isotopic composition of these springs indicate that they discharge from largely isolated perched groundwater systems that are recharged primarily by snowmelt. Groundwater Age and Residence Time The residence time of groundwater is often inferred from its \u201cisotopic age,\u201d based on interpretation of environmental tracers such as tritium (3H), chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), or carbon-14 (14C). The isotopic age relates to the time elapsed between groundwater recharge and collection of a sample at a discharge point such as a well or spring (Mazor and Nativ, 1992). Tracer ages may also be influenced by mixing of groundwater from multiple sources, water-min- eral interactions, and groundwater-atmosphere interactions. Therefore, it is advantageous to use several different environmental tracers to estimate groundwater residence time. In this Figure 39\u2013Tritium values for well, spring, and stream samples. Larger values indicate younger water. There are no obvious spatial trends observed. NEW MEXICO BUREAU OF GEOLOGY AND MINERAL RESOURCES 54 section, we present results and interpretations for environmental tracer analyses. Results are summarized in Table 6. Tritium Precipitation samples were not tested for tri- tium for this study. Newton et al. (2012) found tritium levels in precipitation in the southern Sacramento Mountains ranged from 3 to 10 tritium units (TU), reflecting typical seasonal variations and providing a range of values that represent \u201cmodern\u201d precipitation. For a detailed explanation of tracer systematics, see Timmons et al. (2013). In the current study area, tritium concentra- tions in well samples range from 0 to 3.8 TU, with an average value of 1 TU. Tritium concen- trations in springs are slightly higher, ranging from 0 to 5 TU, with an average of 2 TU. Fifty percent of all well and spring samples exhibit tritium values less than 0.8 TU, indicating sub- modern recharge prior to 1952 (Clark and Fritz, 1997). The remaining well and spring water samples are a mixture of recent (5\u201310 years old) and sub-modern recharge. Figure 39 shows the spatial variability of tritium values for samples collected from streams, springs, and wells. Tritium values appear to be spatially distributed randomly, with the exception of samples collected near the northern study area boundary, where all samples exhibit tritium concentrations less than 0.2 TU. Figure 40 shows tritium values as a function of elevation. Apart from the two highest tritium concentrations observed in the northern high mountains, there is no observed correlation between tritium concentrations and elevation. This apparently random spatial variability observed for tritium values suggests a complex hydrologic system, in which recharge occurs in different areas at different rates, and flow paths are relatively isolated from each other. Tritium-Helium / Noble Gases Noble gas analyses were performed on three well sample locations (TB-100, TB-192, and TB-070) within the study area and were used to derive tritium-helium (3H/3He) groundwater ages. The 3H/3He ages for TB-100 and TB-070 were both greater than 50 years, which indicates Figure 40\u2013Tritium concentrations in well and spring samples as a function of elevation. There is no obvious correlation between tritium concentrations and elevation. Figure 41\u2013Map showing location of C-14 sampling and corresponding age.

The old age of most water samples in the study area make this dating method not very useful. Carbon-14 Carbon-14 (C-14) age estimates discussed in this section have been corrected to account for the dissolution of carbon-dead calcium carbon- ate and isotopic exchange between dissolved inorganic carbon and soil CO2, using the mixing model (Clark and Fritz, 1997) (See Appendix 7). It should be noted that this correction method is based on assumed recharge conditions and does not account for other processes such as matrix diffusion of C-14 and sulfate reduction. However, these values are an improvement over the uncorrected or apparent C-14 ages and are sufficient for comparing relative ages of ground- water in the study area. It can be seen in Figure 41 that, as with the tritium data discussed above, C-14 age estimates do not correlate well with elevation. It should be noted that the four youngest age estimates (highlighted in blue) are likely in an open sys- tem where isotopic exchange between dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and soil CO2 occurs (See Appendix 7), resulting in complete or partial equilibration between C-14 in soil CO2 and DIC. Therefore, the true ages of those four samples are likely significantly older than the age estimate shown. Excluding those four samples, the aver- age C-14 age is about 7000 years before present for the springs and wells sampled. The oldest Figure 42\u2013CFC113/CFC12 ratio ages as a function of CFC12 ages. Most ratio ages are younger that CFC12 ages, suggesting that waters of different ages are mixing. 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 CFC12 age (YBP) 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 CFC113/CFC12 age (YBP) NEW MEXICO BUREAU OF GEOLOGY AND MINERAL RESOURCES 56 groundwater sample was collected north of the study area, indicating that recharge to this par- ticular aquifer occurred approximately 17,000 years ago. Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) Calculation of apparent age based on CFC concentrations in water samples depends on the recharge elevation and recharge temperature, with temperature being the more critical vari- able. For this study, we used a recharge eleva- tion of 1828 m (6000 ft) above sea level, which represents an average elevation in the mountains where most recharge probably occurs. We used a recharge temperature of 10\u00b0C (50\u00b0F), which is the average annual temperature at Mescalero, NM according to the Western Regional Climate Center (http://www.wrcc.dri.edu/). These values are reasonable estimates for recharge elevation and temperature. Samples analyzed for chlorofluorocarbons have CFC12 ages ranging from 26 to 56 years, with an average age of 40 years (Table 6). CFC113 ages are generally younger, with an average age of 33 years. Most of the different CFC species apparent ages are not concordant among each other, with discrepancies of 2 to 18 years between CFC12 and CFC113. CFC ratio ages were determined using CFC 2005\u20132a, a U.S. Geological Survey spreadsheet program for preliminary analysis of CFC data (Busenberg and Plummer, 2006). Groundwater apparent ages based on CFC113/CFC12 concentration ratios range from 0 to 49 years, with an average age of 25 years. For most water samples, the ratio ages are younger than apparent ages based on concentrations of CFC12 alone (Fig. 42). The relationship between these two age estimates is indicative of the mixing of waters of different ages (Han et al., 2001; Plummer et al., 2006). In mountain hydrologic systems, mixing of different waters with different ages is a com- mon process. To evaluate the CFC data, we used a simple binary mixing model that assumes that the observed CFC concentrations are a result of the mixing of a \u201cyoung\u201d CFC-bearing component and an \u201cold\u201d CFC-free component (recharged before 1950). Under such circum- stances, the CFC ratio age represents the age of the young component, and the proportion of young water in the mix can be calculated (Han et al., 2001; Plummer et al., 2006; Land and Huff, 2010; Newton et al., 2012). Mixing calculations indicate that young groundwater components in samples collected in the study area represent recharge that occurred between 1984 and 1991. The percentage of young water in well and spring samples ranges from 98% to 8% (Fig. 43). The strong correlation between the CFC12 apparent age and the fraction of young water in the mix, with the oldest samples containing the smallest percentage of young water, indicates that the assumptions associated with this binary mixing model are valid. This correlation also suggests that the percentage of young water is the principal factor influencing groundwater apparent age based on individual CFC species (e.g., Long et al., 2008). This assertion is also supported by the correlation between the estimated proportion of young CFC-bearing water and tritium concentrations (Fig. 44). Higher proportions of young CFC-bearing water correlate with higher tritium concentrations. Figure 45 shows spatial distribution of CFC data in terms of the proportion of young water in the water sample. It should be noted that the number of data points is insufficient to accurately characterize the spatial variability of groundwater ages. However, it is appa- rent that, similar to the observed spatial variability of groundwater age estimated by other methods described above, there are no Figure 44\u2013Tritium concentrations as a function of the proportion of young water, calculated based on CFC data. Higher tritium concentrations correlate with higher proportions of young recharge.

NEW MEXICO BUREAU OF GEOLOGY AND MINERAL RESOURCES 58 obvious spatial trends, indicating a complex system where recharge occurs at various regions at different rates. Groundwater Residence Time From the groundwater age data described above, it is apparent that most samples collected in the study area contain water that is hundreds to thousands years old. This old water is observed at high elevations in the mountains as well as lower elevations in the basin. The pres- ence of this old water in sedimentary and volca- nic rocks in the mountains with relatively high hydraulic gradients suggests that this ground- water is moving very slowly, likely as a result of barriers that effectively restrict groundwater in the mountains from flowing directly into the basin-fill aquifer to the west as mountain block recharge. This interpretation is in agreement with most other researchers (Garza and McLean, 1977; Orr and Myers, 1986; Waltemeyer, 2001; Huff, 2004, Livingston and Shomaker, 2006) who assume that most recharge to the basin-fill aquifer occurs as mountain-front recharge as a result of runoff in the different drainage basins. Water that makes it into mountain streams can potentially recharge the basin-fill aquifer at and west of the Alamogordo Fault. Tritium and CFC data indicate that although much of the groundwater is very old, there is young water (less than 50 years old), that makes its way into the system and mixes with the older water. This young water, according to CFC analyses, generally represents recharge that occurred between 1984 and 1991. Again, there is no obvious correlation between the occurrence of this young water and topography. It should be noted that the mixing of young and old waters likely occurs by two mechanisms: 1) macrodis- persion, and 2) multiple recharge areas along a flow path. Macrodispersion is mixing of a sub- stance, in this case environmental tracers, due to spatial variations in the flow velocity of ground- water along a flow path. The tortuous flow paths through different lithologies and structures in this mountain hydrologic system likely result in a large range of velocities that cause the mixing of waters of different ages. It is also very likely that along flow paths in the different drainages, water enters the system at different points along a flow path, thereby mixing younger water with older water. The high spatial variability in the groundwater ages discussed above is consistent with stable isotope results that suggest that flow paths in different areas, the locations of which are controlled by the location of the large drainages coming off the mountains, are isolated from each other. northeastern tularosa basin region 59 In this section we draw conclusions from the data set we have described so far. Integrating results from geologic mapping, hydrograph analysis, water chemistry and age dating analy- sis, we can identify recharge areas for this region, quantify the groundwater recharge, assess the flow directions and rates of groundwater move- ment, and examine the interactions between different aquifers, as well as groundwater-surface water interactions.

We compare our results and previous studies, identify the location and mechanism for recharge, and then suggest future work to be done. Estimating Darcy calculation values To quantify how much groundwater is recharg- ing the basin we performed a basic Darcy Flow calculation to estimate volumetric flow rate (Q) of groundwater across three transects (Fig. 46) perpendicular to the mountain front. Thanks to our robust data set we are able to calculate the total flow into the basin with more certainty than previous studies which used similar meth- ods (Rau, 1986). The Darcy Flow equation used to quantify volumetric flux is described as: Q = -K \u2217 \u0394h \u2014 \u0394s \u2217 A where A is the saturated cross sectional area of the aquifers, and K is the average hydraulic conductivity of the aquifers. The gradient of the water table ( \u0394h \u2014 \u0394s) is defined as the change in head (\u0394h), divided by the change in distance (\u0394s). Estimating saturated aquifer area is necessary to calculate the quantity of water that can move through each aquifer. The three cross sections that run perpendicular to flow directions into the basin were created for the purpose of determin- ing the aquifers present, and estimating the cross sectional area of the saturated aquifers. The northern cross section trends northeast near Carrizozo to the Bald Hills running approxi- mately 10.6 km (6.6 mi) (E-E\u2019). The central section trends northeast from Three Rivers to Carrizozo and stretches 27.7 km (17.2 mi) (F-F\u2019). This section runs parallel to the Godfrey Hills. The southern cross section extends 37.2 km (23.1 mi) southeast from Three Rivers, paral- lels Highway 54 along the mountain front to Alamogordo (G-G\u2019). In this way, all water that enters the aquifers, either from stream infiltra- tion east of the cross sections, or through deeper flow paths in the mountain block is calculated. Estimating the hydraulic properties of the aquifers present in each cross section is necessary to calculate how quickly groundwater can flow through them. Basin-fill is present in the north- ern section, though very little of it is saturated near Carrizozo and as a result does not contrib- ute much to the groundwater flow. Using hydro- stratigraphic unit descriptions from the geologic mapping efforts, we are able to make educated estimations of hydraulic properties of the other aquifers. The primary aquifer in the northern section is the TKSCC. Hydraulic conductivity is difficult to estimate for this unit as there have been only a few aquifer tests with highly variable results. Based on the unit description of channel fill, weaker cementation, and the existence of numerous springs, we assign a fairly high con- ductivity value to this unit: 0.61 meters/day (2 ft/day). Beneath the TKSCC we find the GLUP hydrostratigraphic unit. We assume a very low hydraulic conductivity as it is made up of highly cemented sandstone, and no springs emerge from this unit: 0.003 meters/day (0.01 ft/day). The central cross section has many of the same aquifers that are present in the northern cross section. The southern cross section is different in that the primary aquifer present is basin-fill.

Recharge Estimates North Using the Darcy Law equation we were able to estimate the total recharge to the basin. In the north, we estimate 4600 AFY moves through the cross section, recharging the basin. This can be normalized to be approximately 650 AFY per mile. The majority of the flow is believed to pass through the TKSCC aquifer. Rau (1986) esti- mated 3000 AFY of recharge. This estimate northeastern tularosa basin region 61 only accounted for flow through the basin-fill aquifer, and assumed 30 m (98 ft) of saturated basin-fill sediment at the mouth of the drainage basin. From our more rigorous aquifer cross section area estimation we find that the majority of the basin-fill in the area of the cross section, at present day, is unsaturated. As the depth of the aquifer was not well constrained in the Rau (1986) recharge calculation, our estimate is likely a more accurate approximation. The USGS study (Waltemeyer, 2001) did not extend north to this portion of the mountain front. Applying the same methods we calculated that approximately 4300 AFY of recharge results from runoff. The Livingston and Shomaker (2006) surplus pre- cipitation calculation for the drainage basins that drain through the northern cross section are estimated to total 8300 AFY of recharge. Central Through the central transect, west of the God- frey Hills, we estimate approximately 4300 AFY of recharge, or 350 AFY per mile. Hydraulic conductivity in this area is believed to be signifi- cantly less than in other areas due to the heavy faulting and volcanic intrusions associated with the Godfrey Hills. These faults and intrusions impede groundwater movement and as a result we reduce the conductivity of the aquifers in the area by an order of magnitude. The USGS (Waltemeyer, 2001) estimates only 640 AFY of stream runoff recharging through this transect. This small value of surface runoff is due largely to the lack of significant drainage basins in the area. Additionally, the Godfrey Hills intrusion acts as a barrier, and as a result, precipitation that falls to the east of these hills drains south before entering the Three Rivers drainage. Livingston and Shomaker (2006) estimate 5800 AFY of recharge. South Recharge through the southern transect is where we see the majority of flow entering the basin. In this area, which is dominated by thick basin- fill deposits, we estimate approximately 60,000 AFY of recharge. That is approximately 2600 AFY of recharge per mile. The stream runoff estimation calculated 40,300 AFY of recharge entering the basin in this area (Waltemeyer, 2001). The Livingston and Shomaker (2006) report estimate was very close to our approxi- mation of recharge, calculating 60,500 AFY of recharge through this transect. Totals In total, the Darcy Flow calculations estimate approximately 67,900 AFY of annual recharge to the basin for the entire study area (Table 7). The average annual volume of precipitation that falls on the study area is roughly 761,500 AFY. (This volume is calculated by taking the mean elevation of each drainage basin and multiply- ing it by the average annual rainfall which falls at that elevation). Our estimate of groundwater recharge to the basin is roughly 8.9% of the total precipitation. This compares well with the Maxey-Eakin estimates of mountain-front recharge for Nevada (Watson et al., 1976), and Utah (Hood and Waddell, 1968). The Darcy Flow recharge value is similar to the surplus pre- cipitation estimate of 75,000 AFY by Livingston and Shomaker (2006). Our Darcy Flow calcula- tion is 22,500 AFY more than the 45,300 AFY estimate of surface water runoff using the Basin- Climatic Characteristic Method for the area. Each flow calculation methods has its own assumptions, uncertainties, and limitations. Darcy\u2019s Law functions under the assumption that the aquifers are isotropic and homogeneous, and the hydraulic conductivities are well defined. As a result, there is a degree of uncertainty associ- ated with these calculations.

There are two mechanisms that facilitate recharge from mountain precipitation to these basin aquifers; mountain-front recharge (MFR), and mountain- block recharge (MBR).

This type of recharge is classified as \u201cmountain-front-recharge\u201d (MFR), and is typically found in arid and semiarid climates. MFR helps to describe the contribution of mountain regions to the recharge of aquifers in adjacent basins (Wilson and Guan, 2004). Water table mounding in the alluvium at the mouths of some drainages supports recharge in these locations. The most prominent example of this can be seen at the mouth of the Three River drainage, and near Carrizozo (Fig. 22). In the upper reaches of most rivers the water table is sloping toward the river, creating a \u201cV\u201d shape which points up gradient (Fig. 23). This indicates that water from the surrounding rocks in the mountains drains into the incised river channel. As the river enters the basin, however, the water table is inverted and points down gradient, creating a mounding effect. This change in gradient indicates that water from the stream is now infiltrating into the aquifer. The transi- tion generally occurs just as the river crosses the Alamogordo fault and flows over the highly conductive basin-fill sediments. Recharge hydro- graphs are also prevalent in these locations, particularly near Carrizozo. Further evidence of MFR is substantiated by determining the residence time/ age of ground- water. Groundwater that enters the basin-fill aquifer via MFR can have a very young age. This is because MFR mainly consists of runoff from storms that is quickly flushed into the basin, where it recharges quickly. The presence of young groundwater in the Tularosa Basin supports this mechanism for providing recharge to the basin (Figs. 39, 41, 45). Groundwater that enters the basin via MFR does not necessarily have to be young however. Water in the streams that lead to MFR can mix with older water discharging from springs at higher elevations. Additionally, older water in the basin mixes with the younger water and confounds the estimated date. Other evidence of MFR is shown by evapora- tion signatures. Groundwater that originated as runoff or streamflow generally has an evapora- tive isotopic signature. Samples collected in the Tularosa Basin commonly show an evaporative isotopic signature (Figs. 37, 38). Estimating the rate of MFR can be fairly straightforward. Recharge can easily be estimated by gauging streams or calculating runoff from a watershed. While the majority of the recharge entering the basin from MFR is from precipita- tion runoff, perennial streams receive additional flow via groundwater/ surface water interactions and springs. The exact volume that is contributed to streamflow in this way is difficult to deter- mine and was not the focus of this report. To get a rough estimate of MFR we used the results presented by Waltemeyer (2001), which calcu- lated stream runoff to the basin. Sixty-six percent of total recharge to the basin is believed to be derived from streamflow/ MFR. High Mountains: Mountain-Block Recharge (MBR) The mountain regions on the eastern border of the study area, which extend from Carrizo northeastern tularosa basin region 63 Mountain in the north to Cloudcroft in the south, are at significantly higher elevations than the rest of the area. With more precipitation fall- ing at high elevations (Fig. 7), recharge is certain to enter the mountain aquifers. The higher eleva- tion also allows for the development of a snow pack in the winter months. Even though the winter precipitation only accounts for a quarter of total precipitation, it provides a slower, more sustained, source of recharge. The water that recharges here slowly flows through the mountain-block, flowing down gradient through the aquifers present, before entering the basin- fill aquifer. This is defined as mountain-block recharge (MBR). While it is difficult to delineate flow paths, we believe the flow generally follows the most direct path down the mountain. Assumed flow paths are from east to west, perpendicular to the water table contours (Fig. 47). Preferential flow can occur along faults. Faults in bedrock create a fracture network that may enhance permeability and direct groundwater flow paral- lel to the fault. Offset along faults may juxta- pose a high-permeability unit, such as porous sandstone, against a low-permeability unit like mudstone, creating fault barriers and potentially blocking groundwater flow. As the western side of the Sacramento Mountains is the result of faulting determining flow through these rocks is very difficult. Evidence of recharge occurring in the high mountains is supported by well hydrograph analysis. Sixty percent of wells located in the HM regions show recharge trends, which corre- late with monsoonal precipitation, or spring melt recharge (Figs. 24, 25, 26). Chemistry data in the basin points to recharge from the high mountains. In the north, well and spring data show high silica values, and in the south there are high values of carbonate and evaporite elements (Ca, SO4, Cl). These chemical signatures are the result of groundwater being in prolonged contact with the rocks present in the high mountains.

Offset along faults may juxta- pose a high-permeability unit, such as porous sandstone, against a low-permeability unit like mudstone, creating fault barriers and potentially blocking groundwater flow. As the western side of the Sacramento Mountains is the result of faulting determining flow through these rocks is very difficult. Evidence of recharge occurring in the high mountains is supported by well hydrograph analysis. Sixty percent of wells located in the HM regions show recharge trends, which corre- late with monsoonal precipitation, or spring melt recharge (Figs. 24, 25, 26). Chemistry data in the basin points to recharge from the high mountains. In the north, well and spring data show high silica values, and in the south there are high values of carbonate and evaporite elements (Ca, SO4, Cl). These chemical signatures are the result of groundwater being in prolonged contact with the rocks present in the high mountains. Silica concentration found in the northern portion of the basin tells us that the groundwater passed through the igneous materials in the Sierra Blanca Mountains. Higher carbonate levels in the groundwater in the southern basin suggest that it drained through the sedimentary rocks in the southern Sacramento Mountains. This means that some of the groundwater originated in the HM before slowly moving through the mountain rocks and finally into the basin. We call this mountain-block recharge. Another indicator of mountain-block recharge is samples with a high chloride to sodium ratio. Higher ratios of chloride indicate contact with a brine source. Samples that indi- cate brine mixing are associated with faults, which may provide a conduit for bringing up brines from depth, through longer flow paths (Figs. 31, 32, 34). Stable isotope chemistry was conducted to shed more light on mountain-block flow paths in the area, and to answer questions of when, where and how fast recharge occurs. This data set served to reiterate how complicated the groundwater system is. In the NHM we see a wide range of values that demonstrate distinct summer and winter precipitation. Addi- tionally we see distinct summer and winter evaporation trends. This broad range of values indicates a non-mixed system, showing that individual groundwater flow paths are not interconnected on a large scale. Groundwater age, estimated with tritium, CFC, and C-14, shows that while the individual flow paths are not mixed, water within the flow paths is. The presence of young and old water within the flow paths likely occurs as result of spatial variability in the flow velocity as result of different lithologies and structures, and multiple recharge zones. The SHM stable isotope data suggest that the majority of the groundwater recharge originates as summer precipitation, with a smaller percent derived from winter precipitation. The wide range of values again indicates that this is not a well-mixed system, and that recharge in the high mountains occurs at different rates in different areas. Flow paths in different areas appear to be isolated from each other. Spatial distribution of ground- water age supports this slow, non-mixed model of mountain-block recharge we see throughout the mountains. To estimate the volume of recharge to the basin via MBR we looked at the difference between the Darcy Flow calculations and the Figure 47\u2013Estimated flow paths, based on water table contours. NEW MEXICO BUREAU OF GEOLOGY AND MINERAL RESOURCES 64 Basin-Climatic Characteristic stream flow estimates (Walte- meyer, 2001). If the Walte- meyer study accounts for all surface runoff entering the basin via MFR, and the Darcy calculation accounts for both infiltrated surface water (MFR) and deeper flow paths (MBR), then we estimate that on average 33% comes from deeper flow paths, or mountain-block recharge. Our findings agree with the conclusions of Eastoe and Rodney (2014) that both MBR and MFR play a role in recharging the Tularosa Basin in this study area. Groundwater-Surface Water Interactions As streams flow down the mountain front a certain amount of mixing of water from different origins occurs. Adding to the complexity are springs, which generally occur at breaks in slope, changes in lithologies, and faults. Alternatively, streams can also lose water as they flow down the mountain. Stream water typically is young and has an evaporative signature. When this water infiltrates into the mountain aquifers it can be incorporated into the deeper flow paths and lead to the appearance of groundwater from a mixture of different sources. Water-levels in wells in the vicinity of streams are closely linked to stream flow. These wells often respond more rapidly to precipitation or snowmelt events, and have larger fluctuations. northeastern tularosa basin region 65 Implications and Future Work The results of this study have significantly increased our knowledge about the hydrologic system responsible for recharging the Tularosa Basin from the east. Surface water and ground- water, which originate from the western side of the Sacramento Mountains, is crucial for sustaining water levels in the basin aquifers. Previous studies in the area suggested that runoff infiltrating to the basin from streams is the primary source of water entering the basin, or MFR. With the help of groundwater-level records, chemical analysis, age dating of water, detailed geologic mapping and the construction of detailed cross sections we were able to evalu- ate the potential input from deeper flow paths entering the basin through MBR. Our work suggests that deep flow paths do exist, however flow is highly variable due to the fractured and faulted mountain-block geology. Environmental tracer data suggests that the individual flow paths are isolated from each other. Within the flow paths, however, mixing occurs due to heav- ily fractured aquifer systems. As a result of the different lithologies and structures in the moun- tain hydrologic system, a large range of velocities exist that cause mixing of waters of different ages. Comparing existing MFR approximation with our Darcy Flow calculations we were able to estimate that roughly 22,500 AFY replenishes the basin through MBR. Our results suggest approximately 68,000 AFY of water enters the basin along this stretch of mountains. A total of 66% is estimated to enter the basin via streams and runoff at the mountain front, while 33% is believed to derive from deeper mountain-block flow paths. While the portion represented by MFR is considered to be potable water, the portion entering the basin via MBR may not be. Groundwater that recharges the basin via the deep flow paths is typically very old water, and has been in contact with the mountain aquifers for an extended period. The longer water is in contact with the aquifers the more dissolution occurs, and as a result, the potability of the water is diminished. While the quality of the MBR is not ideal it is a fairly reliable source. Additionally, the long tortuous flow paths associated with MBR makes it less susceptible to drought. While recharge derived from MFR is a good source of fresh, potable water, it is not a very reliable source of recharge. MFR is highly dependent upon precipitation, and as a result is heavily impacted by periods of drought. Many of the streams whose flow was estimated to account for MFR are ephemeral, and rely on runoff from storm events. This has important implications on"

This has important implications on how this hydrologic system may respond to variability in precipitation. Future research on the effects of global climate change on the North American monsoon and hurricane systems will help to predict how climatic controls on ground- water recharge may change in the near future. An additional line of research for future work is the creation of a detailed 3D groundwa- ter flow model of the area. Models of ground- water flow in the basin already exist, however flow through the mountain-block has not yet been attempted. Previously a study modeling the flow through the mountain-block would not have been feasible, however, with the help of the detailed geologic mapping that was conducted for this study a comprehensive groundwater flow model of the basin and adjacent mountains is possible. Not included in this report is the potential impact of the closure of Bonito Lake in 2012. Prior to the Little Bear Fire that lead to its closure, Alamogordo was receiving 20% of its water from the lake. An increased dependence (albeit temporarily) on groundwater, as a result of the closure of Bonito Lake, will likely lead to a decline in the water table. As result, continued water level monitoring will be crucial to observe future groundwater depletion. With the city\u2019s increased dependence on local groundwater, community outreach relating to water conserva- tion is highly encouraged.
