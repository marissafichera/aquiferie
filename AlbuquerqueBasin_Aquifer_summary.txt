The text repeatedly indicates uncertainty about the exact aquifer name due to difficulty extracting information from a PDF, but several formations and aquifers are mentioned. References point to the Santa Fe Group aquifer system—particularly the axial facies of the Sierra Ladrones Formation (QTsa)—as well as the Albuquerque Basin aquifer. The associated geological formations (Zia, Abiquiu, etc.) are discussed largely for their stratigraphic and hydrogeological significance, suggesting the study focuses on the broader Santa Fe Group aquifer system in the region, with possible emphasis on the Sierra Ladrones Formation.
