Annual NMGS Fall Field Conference Guidebooks Every fall since 1950, the New Mexico Geological Society (NMGS) has held an annual Fall Field Conference that explores some region of New Mexico (or surrounding states). Always well attended, these conferences provide a guidebook to participants. Besides detailed road logs, the guidebooks contain many well written, edited, and peer-reviewed geoscience papers. These books have set the national standard for geologic guidebooks and are an essential geologic reference for anyone working in or around New Mexico. Free Downloads NMGS has decided to make peer-reviewed papers from our Fall Field Conference guidebooks available for free download. This is in keeping with our mission of promoting interest, research, and cooperation regarding geology in New Mexico. However, guidebook sales represent a significant proportion of our operating budget. Therefore, only research papers are available for download. Road logs, mini-papers, and other selected content are available only in print for recent guidebooks.

INTRODUCTION Numerous lithostratigraphic units in the Santa Fe Group have been differentiated near Espa\u00f1ola during recent STATEMAP geo- logic mapping. These units are based primarily on their composi- tion and gross texture. Textural properties in\ufb02uence the perme- ability of clastic materials and groundwater \ufb02ow to wells. For example, a well-sorted, clean sand or gravel can more readily release groundwater from storage and allow faster groundwater \ufb02ow than a silty-clayey, poorly sorted sand. If mapped lithostrati- graphic units are differentiated in part on properties that also in\ufb02u- ence groundwater \ufb02ow, then there may be signi\ufb01cant differences in hydraulic parameters between these units. This study addresses that possibility near the city of Espa\u00f1ola by comparing values of hydraulic conductivity (K) derived from aquifer test data in wells screened across recognizable lithostratigraphic units. The city of Espa\u00f1ola lies in the heart of the Espa\u00f1ola Basin (Fig. 1), one of several basins near the Rio Grande formed by tectonic extension associated with the Rio Grande rift (Kelley, 1956; Spiegel and Baldwin, 1963; Chapin, 1971). The Espa\u00f1ola Basin is \ufb01lled with relatively thin Quaternary deposits, resting upon siliciclastic sediment (primarily sand, with lesser mud and gravel) of the Santa Fe Group of Spiegel and Baldwin (1963), which ranges in age from late Oligocene through late Miocene (Smith, 2004; Koning et al., 2004). Galusha and Blick (1971) subdivided the Santa Fe Group into the Tesuque Formation and overlying Chamita Formation. The Tesuque Formation, in turn, was subdivided into various members, including the Chama-El Rito and Ojo Caliente Sandstone Members in the northwestern part of the basin, and the Pojoaque, Skull Ridge, and Nambe Members in the eastern part of the basin. Cavazza (1986) rec- ognized that basin-\ufb01ll sediments in the eastern part of the basin, represented by the Pojoaque, Skull Ridge, and Nambe Members in the Galusha and Blick (1971) stratigraphic scheme, could be differentiated lithostratigraphically into two units having differ- ent composition and provenance: lithosome A and lithosome B (Figs. 2, 3). Recent mapping in the central and eastern parts of the basin found the lithosome stratigraphic scheme of Cavazza (1986) more recognizable and easier to differentiate in the \ufb01eld, WHERE IS THE WATER? \u2013 A PRELIMINARY ASSESSMENT OF HYDROGEOLOGIC CHARACTERISTICS OF LITHOSTRATIGRAPHIC UNITS NEAR ESPA\u00d1OLA, NORTH-CENTRAL NEW MEXICO DANIEL J. KONING1, SCOTT ABY2, AND STEVE FINCH3 1 New Mexico Bureau of Geology and Mineral Resources, 801 Leroy Place, Socorro, NM 87801, dkoning@nmt.edu 2 Muddy Spring Geology, Box 488, Dixon, NM 87527. 3 John Shomaker and Associates, 2703-B Broadbent Parkway, Albuquerque, NM 87107 ABSTRACT \u2014 For lithostratigraphic units near Espa\u00f1ola, potential hydrologic differences were assessed by estimating hydraulic conductivity (K) from transmissivity values. These transmissivity values were obtained from aquifer tests of wells (120-1500 ft deep) screened across one or more of these lithostratigraphic units, which include Quaternary valley-\ufb01ll sediments and units in Santa Fe Group basin-\ufb01ll sediments (late Oligocene to late Miocene). Depths of particular Santa Fe Group lithostratigraphic units vary with location due to faulting and west-tilting of the Espa\u00f1ola half-graben. Values of hydraulic conductivity ranged over two orders of magnitude, from 0.1 to 34 ft/day. The Quaternary valley \ufb01ll has the highest hydraulic conductivity (0.7 to 34 ft/day, averaging 10 ft/day). The Chamita Formation and middle to upper Ojo Caliente Sandstone of the Tesuque Forma- tion may provide the most productive water-bearing zones in the Santa Fe Group (with K ranging from 0.7 to 7.3 ft/day), fol- lowed by a combined unit consisting of interbedded Ojo Caliente Sandstone-Cejita Members and underlying lithosome B of the Pojoaque Member of the Tesuque Formation (K of 0.7 to 1.4 ft/day). In general, hydraulic conductivity for the remaining lithostratigraphic units, located in a lower stratigraphic position, range from 0.1 to 3 ft/day, with lithosome B of the Pojoaque and Skull Ridge Members being on the higher end of that range. Hydraulic conductivity generally decreases with stratigraphi- cally lower units. Other in\ufb02uences on hydraulic conductivity and well yields include, but are not limited to, faults that act as barrier boundaries and secondary mineralization (cementation). FIGURE 1.

For this study, we compiled information from existing well records and consultant reports that incorporated aquifer test data of Santa Fe Group units. We focused our search in the Espa\u00f1ola Basin north of the Pojoaque River and south of Velarde, and between Espa\u00f1ola and Medanales in the Abiquiu embayment (note that the Ancha Formation is not present in this area). The study area lies to the north of a previous hydrogeo- logic study conducted by Johnson and Koning (2005) south of the Pojoaque River. Aquifer test data (from pumping tests) were used for a preliminary correlation of hydraulic conductivity and lithostratigraphic units. METHODS We searched the library of the Of\ufb01ce of the State Engineer (OSE) for hydrogeologic consultant reports associated with pro- posed subdivisions in the study area, and noted those that had raw aquifer test data and/or analyses of these data (e.g., calculated transmissivity values). Typically, aquifer tests were performed by pumping wells at a given discharge and measuring drawdown in the well as a function of time. Additional consultant reports not found in the OSE library were generously provided by Glo- rieta Geoscience Incorporated and John Shomaker and Associ- ates. Table 1 lists consultant reports that had usable data. Table 2 contains a summary of these aquifer test data, and the associated wells are shown on Figure 1. We also determined which of the lithostratigraphic units of Figures 2 and 3 were encountered in the wells with aquifer test data by reviewing drillers\u2019 reports, infor- mation from the consultant reports, geologic maps of the area, and personal inspection of drill cuttings and down-hole geophysi- cal logs. For this study, we commonly grouped lithostratigraphic units identi\ufb01ed in previous geologic mapping into combined units (Fig. 4) based on practicality. For example, screened intervals might extend across a particular combination of previously identi\ufb01ed lithostratigraphic units, resulting in the inability to isolate the hydrologic characteristics of a single unit in that combination. However, that combination might be commonly encountered in screened intervals of other wells and thus serves as a useful comparative unit. A screened interval may not fully penetrate all units in these combinations. Such groupings of lithostratigraphic units may yield a somewhat heterolithic combination of other- wise distinctive lithostratigraphic units (in our case, eolian and \ufb02uvial strata), but it allows one to compare similar stratigraphic FIGURE 2.

Schematic cross-section near Espa\u00f1ola illustrating the main lithostratigraphic units differentiated in the area by Koning (2002a, 2003), Koning and Manley (2003), and Koning et al.

In some wells, we had to make educated guesses regard- ing the depth interval of the \ufb01lter pack (italicized in Table 2). Hydraulic conductivity values calculated from the aquifer tests were then depicted for each of the comparative lithostratigraphic units on two box-and-whisker plots (Figs. 5, 6), where the lithostratigraphic units are arranged approximately from young- est (on top) to oldest (on bottom). RESULTS Twenty-two wells in the study area contained both aquifer test data and useful lithologic logs. We were able to correlate pump- ing test results to all seven of our comparative lithostratigraphic units. However, four of these units have data from only one or two pumping tests: lithosome A of the Nambe Member, lithosome TABLE 1. Consultant reports for Espa\u00f1ola area with pump test data.

We refer to these combined and uncombined lithostratigraphic units as \u201ccomparative lithostratigraphic units\u201d in this paper. The comparative lithostratigraphic units used in this study (Table 3; Fig. 4) include 1) lithosome A of the Nambe Member (Ttan); 2) lithosome B of the Nambe Member (Ttbn); 3) lithosome B of the Pojoaque and Skull Ridge Members (Ttbps); 4) lower Ojo Caliente Sandstone and upper Chama-El Rito Member (Ttol-Ttchu); 5) inter\ufb01ngering Cejita Member and Ojo Caliente Sandstone overlying lithosome B of the Pojoaque Member (Tto- Ttce/Ttbp); 6) middle to upper Ojo Caliente Sandstone and the overlying lower Vallito Member of the Chamita Formation (Tcvl- Ttomu); and 7) relatively young Quaternary valley-\ufb01ll sediments (Qay). From the transmissivity data in Table 2, we calculated a range of hydraulic conductivity values by dividing the transmissivity by the length of the saturated \ufb01lter pack (for a minimum value) 478 KONING, ABY, & FINCH B of the Nambe Member, the intercalated Ojo Caliente-Cejita Member together with underlying lithosome B of the Pojoaque Member, and the lower Ojo Caliente Sandstone-upper Chama El- Rito Member (Tables 2, 3). Absence of data for these units means that our interpretations of their hydrogeologic character must be considered as tentative and preliminary. The remainder of the comparative lithostratigraphic units had three or more aquifer test data: lithosome B of the Pojoaque-Skull Ridge Members, the lower Vallito Member and middle-upper Ojo Caliente Sandstone, and the Quaternary valley-\ufb01ll sediments. Six pump-tests could not be used because the screen extends across two saturated units, one common case being saturated Quaternary valley-\ufb01ll and the underlying Santa Fe Group; in that case one cannot isolate hydro- logic data for a single unit and these units are suf\ufb01ciently differ- ent to consider combining them. Santa Fe Group The Santa Fe Group includes the Tesuque and Chamita For- mations. These formations are generally composed of \ufb02uvial sediments derived from the Sangre de Cristo and Tusas Moun- tains. The Ojo Caliente Sandstone of the Tesuque Formation is primarily an eolian dune \ufb01eld deposit. The \ufb02uvial parts of these units are generally poorly to moderately sorted and locally may contain appreciable thicknesses of claystone or mudstone beds and volcanic ash beds (Table 3). The Ojo Caliente Sandstone is a moderately well-sorted, upper \ufb01ne- to lower coarse-grained sand. The middle and upper part of the Ojo Caliente Sandstone is generally a medium- to coarse-grained sand and grossly coarser than underlying strata (Table 3). Hydraulic conductivity in the range of ~0.1 to 3 ft/day typify most sediments in the Santa Fe Group, consistent with estimates of Hearne (1980) in the Pojoaque River valley. Exceptions are values of 0.7 to 9 ft/day (mostly 0.7-7.3 ft/day) obtained in the Agua Sana #1 and #2 wells, which draw from the middle and upper parts of the Ojo Caliente Sandstone together with the lower part of the Vallito Member of the Chamita Formation (Table 2). However, this same comparative lithostratigraphic unit pro- duced lower values of 0.1-1.0 ft/day at the Tres Montes well (RG-74486). The comparative lithostratigraphic unit consist- FIGURE 4.

Quaternary valley-\ufb01ll sediments Wells drawing water exclusively from the younger Quaternary valley-\ufb01ll sediments generally have high hydraulic conductivity that ranges from 0.7 to 34 ft/day and averages approximately 10 ft/day. These data support earlier inferences regarding the relative hydraulic conductivity of this unit (Hawley, 1995) DISCUSSION Quaternary valley-\ufb01ll alluvium The Quaternary valley-\ufb01ll alluvium tapped by the examined wells is between 40 and 240 ft thick, whereas the maximum saturated thickness of Quaternary alluvium is 116 ft. Some units reported as Quaternary alluvium are not axial river gravel but include sediment derived from tributary arroyos (e.g., east of the Rio Grande in the Alcalde area). This tributary Quaternary allu- vium may be less coarse-grained than axial-type \ufb02uvial deposits and therefore may have somewhat lower hydraulic conductivity values. We conclude that the Quaternary alluvium underlying the modern river valleys generally constitutes the most permeable (i.e. highest-yielding) sediments in the northern Espa\u00f1ola Basin. Both its range of hydraulic conductivity (0.7 to 34 ft/day) and its average (10 ft/day) are signi\ufb01cantly higher than those of the Santa Fe Group units. This result is probably due to the relatively coarse-grained nature of the valley-\ufb01ll alluvium, together with its general lack of cementation and compaction. The Quaternary valley-\ufb01ll aquifer is also the most vulnerable to contamination because most people live on top of this shallow unit in the valleys. Speci\ufb01c water quality problems associated with this unit include high nitrates or coliform due to improperly spaced or sited septic tanks, and in\ufb01ltration of solvents in some industrial areas. In\ufb02uence of faults on hydraulic conductivity Analysis of drawdown curves of aquifer test data for the Agua Sana #1, Ojas #1, and the Espa\u00f1ola #8 and #9 wells showed that impermeable boundaries or low-permeability units were encoun- tered, as indicated by steepening of the drawdown curves toward the end of long-term (>90 hr), constant pump-rate tests. Both the original reports and our geologic mapping indicate that the most likely factor causing the steepening of the drawdown curve in these wells is the presence of one or more faults. Faults can act as either barriers to groundwater \ufb02ow (where cataclasis or crushing of rock or sediment in the fault zone creates a \ufb01ne-grained, low permeability, steeply dipping zone) or as conduits for enhanced groundwater \ufb02ow (where fracturing of competent rock enhances porosity).

If a fault initially acted as a conduit for groundwater \ufb02ow, the relatively high \ufb02ux of solutes may lead to enhanced cementation and sub- sequent plugging of \ufb02ow paths. Therefore, it is possible that an individual fault can initially enhance groundwater \ufb02ow and then later impede it. One type of fault common in the Ojo Caliente Sandstone is the sand deformation band fault (Fig. 7). These faults, in addition to cementation effects, may in\ufb02uence hydraulic conductivity values (Goodwin et al., 1999). The middle to upper Ojo Caliente Sand- stone has relatively high hydraulic conductivity east of the Santa Clara fault in Agua Sana wells #1 and #2 (0.73 to 8.9 ft/day) and lower hydraulic conductivity west of this fault at the Tres Montes well (0.13 to 1.0 ft/day). A single test of the lower Ojo Caliente Sandstone and uppermost Chama-El Rito Member west of the fault (MFM Finch well at Cedar Ridge) also showed a relatively low hydraulic conductivity (0.15 to 1.4 ft/ day). Field observa- tions indicate more small-scale faults and localized cementation on the western, footwall side of the Santa Clara fault (fault shown in Fig. 1) and this may partly or wholly account for this apparent difference in hydraulic conductivity. It should be noted that the Agua Sana wells are roughly twice as deep as the Cedar Ridge (MFM Finch) and Tres Montes wells, and that the \ufb01rst aquifer test shortly after initial completion the Agua Sana well #1 gave a relatively low hydraulic conductivity (0.88 to 2.2 ft/day). These values and the average of this range, however, are still higher than that of wells in the Ojo Caliente Sandstone west of the Santa Clara Fault. These faults and cementation will probably also result in lower than expected yields in the stratigraphic gradation between the Ojo Caliente Sandstone and the underlying Chama- El Rito Member immediately west of the Santa Clara fault. How- ever, higher values of transmissivity and hydraulic conductivity may be present in the Ojo Caliente Sandstone and Chama-El Rito Members in areas distant from major fault zones. Hydrogeologic character of the comparative lithostratigraphic units Our limited data set suggests a steady decrease in hydraulic conductivity with stratigraphically lower comparative lithostrati- graphic units in the Santa Fe Group, and that Quaternary valley- \ufb01ll sediments can be expected to have the highest conductivity (Figs, 5, 6). This is likely due to a general coarsening-upward FIGURE 7. Examples of sand deformation band faults near the MFM-Finch Well (upper left) and the Tres Montes Well (remaining three photos). Increments on staff are 10 cm. 483 WHERE IS THE WATER? trend in the Santa Fe Group (Koning, 2002a, b; 2003; Koning et al., 2005), the relatively well-sorted nature of the stratigraphi- cally high Ojo Caliente Sandstone, and the loss of pore space in stratigraphically older strata owing to more compaction and cementation. The lower part of the Tesuque Formation is represented by two lithostratigraphic units, one in lithosome A one in lithosome B of the Nambe Member. Each of these units had a single aquifer test in our database; these two tests indicated a low hydraulic conduc- tivity of 0.015 to 0.082 ft/day. These low values may possibly characterize the lower Tesuque Formation unless coarse-grained, high-permeablility channel-\ufb01ll deposits happen to be encoun- tered that are both extensive and hydraulically connected to other channel \ufb01lls. Hydraulic conductivity for lithosome B of the Pojoaque \u2013 Skull Ridge Member and the upper Chama-El Rito Member and lower Ojo Caliente Sandstone exhibits a wide range of 0.058 to 3.0 ft/day. Thus, wells in these aquifers potentially may produce slightly higher yields and hydraulic conductivities than the lower part of the Tesuque Formation. However, the paucity of pumping test data for the lower part of the Tesuque Formation makes this comparison tenuous. The two comparative lithostratigraphic units that include the Ojo Caliente Sandstone had several aquifer tests that yielded a range of hydraulic conductivity of 0.13-8.9 ft/day, which indicate generally higher-yielding units relative to other Santa Fe Group units. However, groundwater movement in the Ojo Caliente Sandstone is also affected by cementation and sand deformation band faults, as discussed above. CONCLUSIONS Our preliminary \ufb01ndings are as follows: 1. Quaternary alluvium, where adequately saturated, is the best unit for high-yielding wells. However, it is also the most vulner- able to contamination. 2. Two of our comparative lithostratigraphic units involving the Ojo Caliente Sandstone may offer higher-yielding zones rela- tive to other Santa Fe Group, basin-\ufb01ll units. These are 1) the Ojo Caliente Sandstone and the overlying Vallito Member of the Chamita Formation; and 2) intercalated Ojo Caliente Sand- stone and Cejita Member strata underlain by lithosome B of the Pojoaque Member. Aquifer tests conducted on these two units yielded hydraulic conductivity of 0.13-8.9 ft/day. Factors that may signi\ufb01cantly limit well production in these two units include bar- riers or impermeable boundaries from faults and reduced perme- ability from secondary mineralization (cementation). Such faults and cementation seem to be relatively common in the vicinity of the con\ufb02uence of the Rio Ojo Caliente and Rio Chama, located a few kilometers northwest of the Santa Clara fault. These barrier boundary conditions have the potential to reduce yields to nearby wells. 3. Hydraulic conductivity decreases in stratigraphically lower lithostratigraphic units in the Tesuque Formation, with a range from 0.1 to 3 ft/day. Lithosome B of the Pojoaque and Skull Ridge Members is on the higher end of that range. Based on lim- ited data, hydraulic conductivity may generally decrease down section within the Tesuque Formation.

Hydraulic conductivity decreases in stratigraphically lower lithostratigraphic units in the Tesuque Formation, with a range from 0.1 to 3 ft/day. Lithosome B of the Pojoaque and Skull Ridge Members is on the higher end of that range. Based on lim- ited data, hydraulic conductivity may generally decrease down section within the Tesuque Formation.
