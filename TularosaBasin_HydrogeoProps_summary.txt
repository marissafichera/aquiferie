Across several referenced sections, the reports consistently do not provide detailed, quantitative values for many hydrogeologic properties—such as porosity, permeability, specific storage, and specific yield. While some documents note that water flow varies by sediment type (e.g., sands/gravel versus silts/clays) and briefly mention or estimate hydraulic conductivity, transmissivity, and storage coefficients (often tied to aquifer thickness or well data), they generally focus on broader topics. These include overall hydrogeology, sediment characterization, groundwater salinity distribution, and the study area’s geography and recharge dynamics, rather than offering comprehensive or explicit measurements of key hydrogeologic parameters.
