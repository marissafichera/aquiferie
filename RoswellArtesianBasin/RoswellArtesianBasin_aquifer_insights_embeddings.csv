"Based on the text provided, the section appears under the heading “Effects of Forest Harvest on Water Yields” by Lee H. MacDonald, which is the closest match to a study title in the excerpt.","They focus on three closely related aquifers: the Roswell Basin shallow (alluvial) aquifer, the Roswell artesian aquifer, and the Capitan aquifer (near Carlsbad).","They present a west–east cross section (a two-dimensional slice) through the Roswell artesian basin, showing the aquifer units and confining beds. However, the text does not describe or map the full aerial (plan-view) extent of the aquifer in two dimensions.","No. The cited text does not explicitly define the base of the aquifer or the specific data used to delineate it. It indicates that the Seven Rivers and Yeso Formations act as “regional confining units,” implying that the aquifers lie above those formations, but the report does not provide details on how the base of the aquifer was specifically determined.","No. While the study used standard USGS MODFLOW software and other modeling tools, the text does not indicate that a separate, published digital product explicitly defining the aquifer extent was released.","Yes. The report identifies the San Andres as the main artesian aquifer, the Seven Rivers and Yeso Formations as confining units, and a shallower alluvial aquifer. They use geologic cross sections, formation descriptions, and well data (e.g., water levels, geologic logs) to delineate these units and thereby define the basin’s hydrostratigraphy.","No. The sections discuss which formations act as confining units and show a generalized flow pattern on a west–east cross section, but they do not explicitly define subsurface structural controls such as faults or folds. They rely on stratigraphic information (e.g., the Seven Rivers and Yeso Formations) rather than describing specific structural data to explain groundwater flow.","Yes. Although not labeled as “recharge zones” and “discharge zones” in formal headings, the text describes recharge areas (mountain fronts, rivers, streams, arroyos, and faults where precipitation infiltrates) and discharge areas (springs, wetlands, and streams where groundwater emerges). This understanding is based on observed water‐level gradients and the known pathways of precipitation infiltration into aquifers.","They do not provide specific numerical rates for any one aquifer or site, only broad estimates. The text notes that recharge from precipitation can range from 0.03% to 20% of mean annual precipitation (depending on local conditions), and mentions typical groundwater flow rates, but does not cite the exact data or methods used to derive these estimates. There are no direct, detailed discharge values or tabulated numbers in the text.",No. The text only describes a west‑east cross section illustrating groundwater flow and aquifer relationships. It does not mention producing a water table elevation map or a depth to water map.,They are based on water-level measurements taken from wells completed in the aquifer; those measured values are then mapped or contoured to show water-table elevation or depth to water across the basin.,"The text does not mention new water‐level measurements being collected specifically for this study. Instead, it indicates that the agencies (OSE/ISC) rely on data provided by the USGS and other entities (irrigation districts, federal agencies), suggesting that the information was compiled from existing sources rather than newly collected.","No. Although the report discusses water quality issues and the concept of total maximum daily load (TMDL), it does not provide specific water quality measurements or data.","It appears that the study primarily used existing historical data records—such as gage measurements, pumping data, and meteorologic records from 1967 to 1996—rather than gathering entirely new data specifically for this project.","They are not explicitly listed in the text. However, based on the discussion of TMDLs and the role of the Surface Water Quality Bureau (New Mexico Environment Department), one can infer that water quality data primarily come from state-led monitoring efforts under the Bureau’s programs and any related TMDL studies. Additional data may be gathered through local watershed assessments and other environmental monitoring activities referenced by the Bureau.","No. The text discusses concepts like porosity and mentions that limestone aquifers have “relatively small storage capacity” and transmit water rapidly, but it does not provide quantitative or specific hydrogeologic properties (e.g., numerical values or defined hydraulic conductivity, transmissivity, etc.).",N/A,"Future work centers on gathering all stakeholders within each river basin and aquifer to collectively negotiate and plan realistic solutions, underpinned by reliable data and clear legal frameworks. Key recommendations include:

• Formal Negotiation/Planning: Bring together water users (e.g., irrigation districts, municipalities, industry, environmental groups) with facilitation by the state. Motivating factors—such as unavoidable legal or supply constraints—are essential for achieving agreement.  
• Water Rights Analysis: Compile accurate, up-to-date water-rights information (quantities, priorities, diversion points, places of use) to guide fair and feasible reallocation decisions.  
• Regulatory and Technical Support: The State Engineer’s Office and the Interstate Stream Commission should provide hydrologic data, adopt rules for water distribution, and assist with system modeling.  
• Measurement and Enforcement: Install metering systems for all diversions. Enforce usage limits and redirect out-of-priority users.  
• Funding and Investments: Support local water administration (e.g., river masters, measurement programs), encourage efficiency improvements, and develop robust models and monitoring programs.  
• Policy Tools: Enable priority administration if negotiations fail, streamline market reallocations (particularly from irrigation to other uses), and protect legitimate environmental flows to reduce federal intervention.",DecisonMakers2003.pdf
"Based on the references provided, the study’s title appears to be “Report on Alternative Solutions [unpublished].”",They focus on the Permian San Andres artesian aquifer (part of the Roswell Artesian Basin).,"Yes. The paper includes a regional map (Figure 1) showing the approximate extent of the Roswell Artesian Basin on a plan view, which effectively represents the aquifer’s 2D extent.","From the information provided, the report does not explicitly define the base of the San Andres aquifer. While it discusses the aquifer’s thickness (approximately 80–140 m near the Pecos River) and indicates that solution processes have removed part of the formation, it does not clearly state how or with what data the aquifer’s lower boundary was determined.",No. None of the referenced materials mention a digital product defining the aquifer’s extent. There is no indication in the provided references that such a digital publication was produced.,"Yes. The paper describes a three-part system—carbonate aquifer, confining unit, and alluvial aquifer—based on geologic cross sections (Figures 1 and 3) and stratigraphic information (e.g., thickness and lithology of the San Andres, Grayburg, Queen, and Seven Rivers Formations). These data, along with previous unpublished and published reports, were used to define the hydrostratigraphy.","From the text provided, the report does recognize that an eastward‐dipping San Andres aquifer and the presence of solution‐enlarged fractures and breccias (caused by evaporite dissolution) control groundwater flow. Although the text does not spell out every type of data used, it indicates that these structural/lithologic controls were inferred largely from geologic cross sections, observed stratigraphic thinning (removal of evaporites), and previous mapping/analyses (for example, Bachman, 1987, and Quinlan’s unpublished 1967 work).","Yes. Although the report does not use the exact phrase “recharge zone,” it identifies the newly expanded wetland west of Lea Lake as a “localized recharge area” for the shallow alluvial aquifer. Discharge occurs where that same aquifer (and lake outflow) ultimately enters the Pecos River. These zones were defined by observing increased flows from Lea Lake, the resultant flooding and wetland expansion, and the measured hydraulic connection to the river (including USGS monitoring‐well data showing rising artesian head).","Yes. The study quantified Lea Lake’s discharge by directly measuring flow at the lake’s drain (e.g., 0.53 m³/s on January 13, 2003) and by tracking annual discharge (approximately 8.5 million m³/year). They also monitored artesian water levels at the nearby Orchard Park well to assess changes in aquifer head. However, while the text discusses a localized recharge area, it does not provide a direct numerical quantification of recharge rates.",The provided sections do not describe the creation of either a water‐table‐elevation map or a depth‐to‐water map; they only mention measured water levels (presented in graphs) rather than mapping them.,They relied on measured water levels (including those from the U.S. Geological Survey Orchard Park monitoring well) and the observed elevations of the Bottomless Lakes to outline the potentiometric (water‐table) surface in the underlying Roswell Artesian Basin.,"From the text, water‐level measurements for the artesian aquifer came from the USGS Orchard Park monitoring well, and the authors also used on‐site measurements (e.g., of Lea Lake discharge) for the study. Thus, they both compiled existing data and gathered new measurements.","Yes. Table 1 in the section presents data on TDS, chloride, sulfate, total hardness, and pH for several of the Bottomless Lakes, indicating that the study does include water quality data.",Based on the referenced materials—most of which are existing publications and reports—it appears that the information was primarily compiled from other sources rather than collected specifically for this study.,"They come primarily from Blinn (1993) for Lazy Lagoon, Mirror Lake, and Lea Lake, and from an unpublished data sheet held by Bottomless Lakes State Park (1992) for Cottonwood Lake and total hardness in all lakes.","None of the cited sections explicitly provide numeric values or detailed discussion of those properties in the text given. Some works (for example, Welder’s 1983 geohydrologic framework) might address parameters like hydraulic conductivity or transmissivity, but such data are not clearly stated in these references as presented.",N/A,"Future work could be directed toward strengthening the regional understanding of aquifer dynamics and dissolution processes while improving long-term water management. Based on the collective emphasis of the references, key recommendations include:

• Expanded Monitoring and Data Collection: Establish additional observation wells and conduct continual measurements of water levels, water quality, and subsidence rates to detect early signs of sinkhole formation and gauge any shifts in aquifer recharge or discharge.

• Geophysical and Geological Surveys: Carry out more detailed geophysical surveys (e.g., seismic, ground-penetrating radar) and refine geologic mapping to better delineate zones of evaporite dissolution and potential sinkhole hazards.

• Enhanced Hydrologic Modeling: Update or develop comprehensive groundwater models incorporating longer-term data sets, climate variability, and land-use changes to predict potential impacts on water availability and aquifer stability.

• Assessment of Water Management Strategies: Evaluate alternative pumping, recharge, or conservation strategies, in conjunction with existing resource demands, to minimize overextraction and reduce the risk of land-surface collapse.

• Cross-Disciplinary Collaboration: Coordinate research among geologists, hydrologists, and resource managers to share data on aquifer conditions, refine sinkhole risk assessments, and ensure that future development is guided by robust scientific knowledge.",Evaporite_Karst_and_Regional_Ground-Water_Circulat.pdf
"Based on the reference to K. W. Stafford, L. Land, and A. Klimchouk in the April 2008 issue of the Journal of Cave and Karst Studies, the study’s title is:  
""Hypogene Speleogenesis in the Delaware Basin: Castile Formation in Southeastern New Mexico and Far West Texas.""","They are focusing on the confined aquifer system developed in the Seven Rivers Formation (i.e., the “Seven Rivers aquifer”).","No. Although they provide conceptual models and schematic illustrations (e.g., Figure 13) showing groundwater flow paths and the cave’s development in cross-section, they do not present a detailed two-dimensional boundary or map outlining the overall aquifer extent. The figures are specifically noted as “not drawn to scale” and serve more to illustrate conceptual flow regimes rather than define the aquifer in 2D.","No. The excerpt does not indicate that the authors explicitly defined the aquifer’s base, nor do they specify data that would delineate it. The text discusses stratigraphic thicknesses and regional structure but does not provide a clear definition of the aquifer’s lower boundary.",No explicit mention is made of a digital product defining the aquifer extent. None of the listed references indicates that such a digital product was published as part of the study.,"They do not present a formal hydrostratigraphic framework (e.g., separate aquifer–aquitard units explicitly defined and mapped). Instead, they describe the Seven Rivers Formation’s stratigraphy (gypsum/anhydrite beds capped by dolomite) and regional confinement conditions, relying on existing geological mapping and previous studies rather than specific aquifer test or well‐log data to characterize the unit hosting Coffee Cave.","From the information provided, the paper does acknowledge that regional structures—broad anticlinal flexures, a slight eastward dip, and high‐angle fractures with minimal offset—help channel ascending waters. However, it does not present new subsurface data (e.g., cross‐sections or borehole data) dedicated solely to delineating those controls. Instead, the authors use regional geologic mapping and observed cave‐morphology patterns (such as vertical feeders aligned with fractures) to infer that these structural elements influence groundwater flow.","The text does not explicitly label “recharge” and “discharge” zones by name, but it does present conceptual models (Figures 13C–F) showing where groundwater enters (upper portions of the formation) and exits (toward the Pecos River Valley). From the references cited (especially Land 2003, 2005, 2006, and Land & Newton 2007), it can be inferred that hydraulic head measurements, environmental tracers, and regional flow patterns were used to delineate where water moves into the Seven Rivers Formation (recharge) and where it ultimately emerges or flows out (discharge).","No. Nothing in the sections provided indicates that the study measured or reported specific recharge or discharge rates. Instead, the text focuses on conceptual models of flow and speleogenesis without presenting numeric data on recharge or discharge.","No. The text does not mention or reference the creation of a water table elevation map or a depth to water map. Instead, it describes conceptual models of groundwater flow and speleogenesis, but does not provide any specific mapping of water levels.","From the cited works, the water table (or depth‐to‐water) maps for the Roswell Basin area were primarily compiled from well‐level measurements, including those in the USGS National Water Information System (NWIS) and published state and federal hydrogeologic reports (e.g., Welder, 1983). These data sets provided the observed water‐level elevations used to construct the maps.","From the references cited, it appears that the study likely involved both collecting new water‐level data and drawing upon existing datasets (e.g., USGS NWIS and previous reports) rather than relying on only one source.","Yes. Several of the cited works (for instance, Land’s 2005 study using environmental tracers and references to USGS NWIS data) indicate that the research involves or draws upon water quality/chemical data.","It appears that the study drew on both previously published datasets (e.g., from the USGS and prior technical reports) and new field investigations (e.g., the work by Land and others). In other words, the researchers compiled data from existing sources and also collected additional information for their study.","From the references provided, the primary water‐quality data source explicitly mentioned is the U.S. Geological Survey’s National Water Information System (NWIS). Additional data may also come from state engineer reports (e.g., Welder, 1983) and environmental tracer studies (e.g., Land, 2005), but NWIS is the main directly cited water‐quality reference.","From the references provided, there is no direct mention of numerical values or detailed discussions of porosity, permeability, specific yield, or similar aquifer‐property parameters. While some citations address aspects of hydrogeology (e.g., groundwater residence time, variations in hydraulic head, and geohydrologic frameworks), none of the listed sections explicitly report or tabulate those specific hydrogeologic properties.",N/A,"Future work is not stated outright in the text, but several ideas can be inferred from the study’s conclusions and conceptual model:

• Detailed Hydrologic and Geochemical Analyses: Expanding water-quality and isotope studies would help confirm whether residual waters from Lake McMillan continue to influence dissolution and sediment infill. Comparing geochemical signatures of cave waters with those from the Roswell Basin aquifer and the lake could clarify the relative contributions of hypogenic versus epigenic processes.

• More Extensive Cave Mapping and Morphologic Characterization: Additional high-resolution mapping of passage geometry and feeder locations could further test the proposed speleogenetic model. Documenting any smaller-scale morphologic features—particularly those indicative of rising free-convection cells—would strengthen the link between Coffee Cave and other known hypogenic caves (e.g., Ozerna Cave in Ukraine).

• Sediment and Detritus Studies: Systematic analysis (including dating and mineralogical composition) of sediments and organic material within the cave would clarify the extent and timing of back-flooding events, helping distinguish between epigenic overprinting and original hypogenic dissolution features.

• Structural and Stratigraphic Investigations: Because dolomite interbeds and regional fracturing appear to facilitate hypogenic flow, further work integrating fracture-mapping with stratigraphic data could pinpoint key conduits and “leaky” confining layers, refining understanding of cross-formational flow paths.

• Monitoring Scarp Retreat and Collapse Processes: Finally, observing ongoing slope failures near the cave’s entrances (e.g., by remote sensing or periodic surveys) would reveal how surface processes interact with preexisting hypogenic systems and help predict future collapse or drainage pathways.",Hypogenic Speleogenesis within Seven Rivers Evaporites_ Coffee Ca.pdf
"The title of the study is “Seasonal and Long-Term Variations in Hydraulic Head in a Karstic Aquifer: Roswell Artesian Basin, New Mexico.”",They focus primarily on the karstic San Andres limestone aquifer (often called the “artesian aquifer”) and also consider the overlying shallow alluvial aquifer within the Roswell Artesian Basin.,"Yes. Figure 1 in the paper provides a map view (plan-view) “Regional Map of Southeastern New Mexico” that shows the boundaries and extent of the Roswell Artesian Basin, indicating a 2D definition of the aquifer’s location.","No. In the portions of the paper provided, the authors do not explicitly define the aquifer’s base or describe how it was determined. They note that the Glorieta Sandstone is the “basal member of the San Andres Formation” and discuss the western boundary (where the water table intersects the Glorieta), but the text does not set out any specific data or methodology used to define the aquifer’s deeper limit.","No. The authors do not mention the development or publication of any digital dataset specifically defining the basin or aquifer boundaries. They describe their new basin-wide study and provide figures illustrating the area, but there is no indication of a publicly released digital product in the excerpt.","Yes. The paper explicitly characterizes the Roswell Artesian Basin as a two-aquifer system (an artesian carbonate aquifer overlain by a leaky evaporitic confining unit and a shallow alluvial aquifer). They used prior geological investigations, well‐log data (including references such as Fiedler & Nye, 1933; Kinney et al., 1968; Welder, 1983), and the newly compiled basin‐wide measurements (e.g., cross sections in Figures 2 and 3) to define the hydrostratigraphy and delineate the boundaries of the aquifers.","From the sections provided, the study does not explicitly present new mappings or detailed analyses of subsurface structural controls on groundwater flow. Although it references fractures, solution channels, and notes features such as the “Pecos Buckles” on a regional map, there is no direct discussion of the specific structural data (e.g., fault mapping, geophysical logs) used to define those controls. The text focuses primarily on water-level changes, aquifer geometry (based on previous definitions of the carbonate and overlying evaporitic units), and recharge/discharge patterns rather than on new structural interpretations.","Yes. They identify the western outcrop area (where the San Andres limestone is exposed) as the principal recharge zone, and the main discharge area is along the Pecos River (notably at Bitter Lakes and Bottomless Lakes). These zones were inferred from water‐level measurements (e.g., the mapped intersection of the water table and the Glorieta–San Andres outcrop), geologic mapping of the aquifer units, and observed spring and sinkhole discharge along the river.","Yes. The authors cite several prior measurements to estimate recharge and discharge. For instance, Hantush (1957) concluded that withdrawals exceeded recharge by about 308 million m³/year, and Barroll and Shomaker (2003) gave a natural discharge figure on the order of 37 million m³/year. These estimates rely on historical well‐pumpage data, water‐level measurements, and other U.S. Geological Survey and State Engineer datasets.","They created maps showing the potentiometric surface (i.e., water‐table elevation), not depth‐to‐water maps.","They used winter (January-February) water level measurements collected by USGS, NM-OSE, PVACD, and NMBGMR, supplemented by older winter data (1975 and 2004) from USGS and OSE historical records.

The text discusses chloride concentrations and total dissolved solids in the artesian aquifer, providing specific ranges and values, indicating that water quality data (particularly salinity and chloride levels) is included in the study.","They gathered new (2005) field measurements from agencies such as the USGS and NM-OSE but also relied on previously recorded, historical water-level data (e.g., from 1975 and 2004). So it was both collected for the study and compiled from existing sources.","They are primarily from direct sampling and measurements documented in the cited studies and reports, including Hood (1963), Hood et al. (1960), Welder (1983), and Land (2003, 2005), which collected chloride and total dissolved solids (TDS) data from sinkhole lakes, springs, and the Pecos River.","No numerical values or property measurements (e.g., specific porosity, transmissivity, or storage coefficients) appear in the excerpt.

• Extend and Enhance Monitoring:  
  – Maintain or expand regular measurement of water levels in both shallow and artesian aquifers to capture seasonal irrigation cycles and longer-term changes.  
  – Improve the spatial coverage of monitoring wells (especially in agricultural hotspots) and revisit older observation wells to ensure continuity of data.  

• Refine Understanding of Drought and Precipitation Impacts:  
  – Correlate water-level fluctuations more precisely with precipitation records and drought indicators.  
  – Investigate how changing precipitation patterns and climate variability might alter recharge rates over the long term.  

• Examine Agricultural Practices and Conservation Measures:  
  – Evaluate the ongoing effects of irrigated farmland retirement and water conservation practices on aquifer recovery.  
  – Study the relationship between specific pumping events (e.g., during peak irrigation) and rapid head declines, with an aim toward optimizing pumping schedules.  

• Improve Groundwater Modeling:  
  – Incorporate updated pumping, precipitation, and water-level data into numerical models for more accurate predictions of aquifer responses under various management scenarios.  
  – Use modeling to test new conservation strategies or changes in land use that could stabilize or improve water levels.  

• Assess Long-Term Sustainability:  
  – Investigate which management approaches (e.g., additional recharge zones or stricter pumping guidelines) might sustain water levels during future drought periods.  
  – Continue to track trends in hydrographs to distinguish between short-term cyclical effects and longer-term shifts related to agricultural expansion or climate change.",J American Water Resour Assoc - 2008 - Land - Seasonal and Long‐Term Variations in Hydraulic Head in a Karstic Aquifer .pdf
"The title of the study is ""Multi-tracer investigation of groundwater residence time in a karstic aquifer: Bitter Lakes National Wildlife Refuge, New Mexico, USA.""",They focused on the karstic “artesian aquifer” formed in the San Andres limestone (often called the San Andres aquifer) within the Roswell Artesian Basin.,"From the discussion of Figures 1 and 2, it appears that a plan‐view map (Figure 1) locates the cross‐section shown in Figure 2, implying that the aquifer’s areal limits were indeed defined in two dimensions. While the text itself focuses on the vertical (cross‐section) and flow‐path details, the mention of “Location of section shown in figure 1” strongly indicates that the study also provides a 2D depiction of the aquifer extent.","No. Within the excerpt provided, the authors do not explicitly define the base of the San Andres (artesian) aquifer or describe which data would have been used for that purpose. They present a west–east hydrostratigraphic cross-section and discuss the aquifer’s upper confining units but do not detail how or where the aquifer’s lower boundary was formally established.","No. The sections provided do not mention or describe any published digital product (e.g., GIS data) that specifically defines the aquifer extent. They show maps and cross‑sections, but there is no mention of a downloadable, digital aquifer boundary file.","Yes. The paper describes the Roswell Artesian Basin hydrostratigraphy as a two-aquifer system consisting of a carbonate (San Andres) aquifer overlain by a leaky confining unit and a shallow alluvial aquifer. This characterization draws on geologic cross-sections (Figure 2), earlier investigations by Fiedler & Nye (1933) and Morgan & Sayer (1942), outcrop descriptions (e.g., Pray 1961), and water-well drilling data (lost-circulation records and “bit drops”) to delineate the aquifer structure.","Yes. The report identifies the “Pecos Buckles”—wrench fault zones extending southwest-northeast across the Pecos Slope—as key subsurface structural controls that enhance recharge through sinkholes and fractures. These fault zones and related solution‑enlarged fractures are mapped and documented by earlier geologic investigations (e.g., Motts and Cushman, 1964; Havenor, 1968; Kelly, 1971; Gross et al., 1976) as referenced in Figures 1 and 2 of the study.","Yes. The study identifies the Sacramento Mountains/Pecos Slope as the principal recharge zone (where losing streams and sinkholes feed the aquifer) and the lower Pecos River and adjacent wetlands as the main discharge zone. These zones were defined primarily through hydrologic and geologic observations such as losing stream segments, sinkholes, solution-enlarged fractures, and cross‐section data showing groundwater flow directions.","No specific numbers or direct quantification of recharge and discharge rates appear in the excerpt. Although the text describes how and where recharge takes place (e.g., runoff from losing streams and sinkholes) and discusses upward discharge into the Pecos River or adjacent wetlands, it does not present actual flow or volume measurements. Instead, it focuses on conceptual flow paths, karst features, and qualitative descriptions of recharge and discharge processes.","No. The excerpt does not mention any water table elevation map or depth‐to‐water map. Instead, it describes a west‐to‐east hydrostratigraphic cross‐section (Figure 2) but does not refer to a specific map of water levels.","From the report excerpts, it appears that measurements of water levels in the individual wells (for example, the static water‐level depth at each well along with a surveyed wellhead or ground elevation) were used to construct the water table or depth‐to‐water map. Essentially, they took depth‐to‐water data from each well and combined it with the known surface or wellhead elevation to map out the aquifer’s water table.","From what is stated in the sections provided, there is no indication that new water‐level measurements were taken as part of this study. The discussion about water levels refers to historic lows during the 1960s and 1970s (referencing Welder, 1983; Land and Newton, 2007; 2008), implying that any water‐level information came from earlier sources rather than from newly collected data.","Yes. Section 5.1 describes general chemistry results—including total dissolved solids, major ions, and other parameters—indicating that water quality data were collected and analyzed as part of the study.","Based on the dates and sample information presented (e.g., specific sampling dates, wells, and springs), it appears this dataset was gathered directly for the study rather than compiled from external sources.","They come from groundwater and surface‐water sampling at multiple wells and springs (e.g., Greene Well, Rogers Well, Thatcher Well) and various locations such as Lake St. Francis, Sago Spring, Lost River Spring, Bitter Creek, Snail Unit Spring, Hunter Marsh, and others. The tables list sampling dates, sites, and corresponding chemical or isotopic measurements that serve as the water‐quality data.","They do discuss secondary (“vuggy and cavernous”) porosity qualitatively and give an inferred hydraulic conductivity of more than 400 m/day based on flow-velocity estimates (Rabinowitz et al., 1977). Other specific hydrogeologic coefficients (e.g., storage coefficients, transmissivity, specific yield) are not reported numerically in the text provided.",N/A,"Based on the report’s findings and gaps, the study would benefit from the following future work:

1. Broader Recharge Characterization.  
   • Expand the focus beyond a narrow recharge belt to test the hypothesis that recharge may occur across a larger catchment area extending into the Sacramento Mountains.  
   • Investigate the interplay among surface water, shallow aquifers, and deeper aquifers to clarify how “daylighting” (where groundwater emerges then re-enters the subsurface) affects the measured tracer ages.

2. Refined Multi-Tracer Approaches.  
   • Incorporate additional tracers not subject to the same degradation or contamination effects that limit CFCs (e.g., noble gases, more robust isotopes).  
   • Conduct time-series or synoptic sampling of springs and wells to observe how seasonal or short-term variations influence CFC, tritium, and other tracer signals.

3. Deeper Aquifer Mixing Quantification.  
   • Further quantify the fraction of older groundwater mixing with younger recharge, especially from underlying Paleozoic aquifers.  
   • Combine new tracer data with more detailed hydrogeological and geochemical modeling to better constrain the proportions and residence times of both components.

4. Verification of Piston Flow vs. Non-Piston Flow Models.  
   • Use hydraulic data, flow modeling, and tracer tests to confirm whether simpler piston flow assumptions are valid or whether significant dispersion, conduit flow, or multi-episode “recycling” is occurring.  
   • Calibrate conceptual models with field measurements (e.g., pumping tests, high-resolution geophysical surveys) to improve flow-path understanding.

5. Integration with Ongoing Studies.  
   • Coordinate with ongoing Bureau of Geology research (Rawling et al.) to combine field observations, stable isotope data, and hydrogeologic mapping.  
   • Investigate how variable recharge processes and repeated “daylighting” across the Pecos Slope and Sacramento Mountains reset tracer clocks and alter aquifer geochemistry.

These steps would help reconcile the discrepancies among CFC, 14C, and tritium data, refine conceptual models of regional flow, and yield more accurate estimates of groundwater residence times.",Multi-tracer_investigation_of_groundwater_residenc.pdf

The paper outlines the Basin’s western, eastern, and southern boundaries, showing where the water-bearing units intersect at the surface and along the Pecos River. These boundaries define the aquifer’s horizontal (2D) extent, even though precise details along the southern boundary are less clearly delineated.","Yes. Although the new study does not spell it out in detail, it follows the longstanding view that the top of the Yeso Formation serves as the lower confining boundary (i.e., the “base”) of the artesian aquifer.

They describe the basin’s boundaries in text and figures but do not explicitly reference a published digital product.,"Yes. The report presents a two-aquifer framework (artesian and shallow) with a confining unit in between, as shown in Figures 2 and 3. It uses cross-sectional data (including well logs, facies changes, and mapped formation boundaries), previous investigations (e.g., Fiedler & Nye, 1933; Hantush, 1957; Kelley, 1971), and stratigraphic markers (such as the Glorieta sandstone and the San Andres Formation) to define the hydrostratigraphy.","Yes. Their potentiometric‐surface maps and corresponding water‐level measurements (USGS, NM‐OSE, PVACD, NMBGMR) revealed steep hydraulic‐gradient zones coincident with subsurface faults (e.g., the KM Fault) and folds (the “Pecos Buckles”).

Figure 2 and the accompanying text show a recharge area on the western outcrop (Pecos Slope) where the aquifer is unconfined, and a discharge area to the east along the Pecos River and associated sinkholes. The study used the regional hydrostratigraphic framework, well data, and observed groundwater flow directions (indicated by arrows in Figure 2) to delineate these recharge and discharge zones.","No. The sections provided discuss well yields, transmissivities, and general flow directions but do not present any explicit basin-wide recharge or discharge figures. They do not describe specific data used to calculate recharge or discharge rates or amounts.","From the descriptions of measuring and mapping “hydraulic head” and showing a “potentiometric surface,” it appears they produced a water table (i.e., head‐elevation) map rather than a simple depth‐to‐water map.","They are based on measured groundwater levels in wells throughout the Basin. In other words, the water-level measurements (potentiometric data) collected from multiple wells were used to map the water table elevations and contours shown in the report.","Both. The report indicates that new water levels were measured during the 2005 investigation, while older water-level data were also compiled from existing sources.","Yes. The report includes data on salinity, chloride, and total dissolved solids (TDS) in the artesian aquifer, noting both spatial and seasonal variations in water quality.","It appears the investigation incorporated new measurements (e.g., a “basin-wide study of hydraulic head”) while also drawing on earlier work (e.g., Hantush 1957, Kelley 1971). Thus, the data used were partly collected specifically for this study and partly compiled from previous sources.","Water quality data for the Roswell Artesian Basin come primarily from:  
• Hood (1963), who measured chloride concentrations across the aquifer and noted depth-related differences;  
• Land (2003, 2005), who reported salinity (chloride, TDS) in sinkhole lakes and springs near Bitter Lakes National Wildlife Refuge and Bottomless Lakes State Park;  
• Mid-20th-century pilot desalination studies that used high-chloride well discharge; and  
• EPA guidelines, particularly for recommended maximum chloride levels in drinking water.","Yes. The report specifically cites Hantush (1957) for aquifer‑test transmissivities, which ranged from about 7,500 to 196,000 ft²/day (700–18,200 m²/day). While it refers to secondary porosity and permeability qualitatively, and discusses well discharges, it does not provide explicit numerical values for porosity, storage coefficients, specific storage, specific yield, or hydraulic conductivity.","Specific transmissivity values (7,500 to 196,000 ft²/day) were published by Hantush (1957), who determined them through aquifer tests in the artesian aquifer.","Although the report does not explicitly list future work recommendations, several needs can be inferred from its discussions of hydrogeology, water management, and aquifer behavior:

1. Extended Monitoring and Data Collection:
   • Continue regular water-level measurements throughout the Artesian Basin to track impacts of pumping and rainfall, especially after periods of drought or unusually high precipitation.  
   • Maintain and expand metering of irrigation wells to capture accurate usage data and more precisely enforce pumping limitations.

2. Hydrogeological and Structural Investigations:
   • Conduct further studies on fault zones (e.g., the KM Fault) and other structural discontinuities to assess how they compartmentalize the aquifer, influence flow patterns, and affect water quality.
   • Refine geochemical and temperature gradient mapping to understand potential heterogeneities in water movement and recharge pathways.

3. Evaluation of Conservation Measures:
   • Periodically review the effectiveness of current water-saving efforts (e.g., farmland retirement programs, adjudication limits) to determine if they are sufficient under varying climatic conditions.
   • Investigate additional or alternative conservation strategies, such as more stringent pumping restrictions or updated irrigation technologies, to sustain water levels and reduce declines during droughts.

4. Climate and Recharge Studies:
   • Monitor long-term precipitation trends and their effect on recharge rates, incorporating updated climate projections for southeastern New Mexico.
   • Examine how short-term weather extremes (e.g., heavy rainfall years) can reduce pumping demand and temporarily raise water levels in peripheral areas.

5. Modeling and Scenario Testing:
   • Develop or refine regional groundwater flow models that incorporate new data on pumping, fault-related compartmentalization, and climate variability.  
   • Test various management or climatic scenarios (e.g., extended drought or population growth) to identify thresholds for water-level stability and to guide water policy decisions.",ofr_503.pdf
It is referred to throughout the references as the “Sacramento Mountains Hydrogeology Study.”,They chiefly studied the artesian (carbonate) aquifer in the San Andres limestone within the Roswell Artesian Basin.,"Yes. The text cites Figure 1 (location/map) and Figure 2 (west–east cross-section), indicating that the aquifer’s boundaries and flow paths are defined in two dimensions.","Yes. They identify the base of the aquifer as the siltstones and gypsum of the underlying Yeso Formation, citing Welder (1983). That formation is referenced as the lower confining unit, effectively defining the aquifer’s base. The study relies on geological mapping and previous investigations (e.g., Welder, 1983) to make this designation.","No. None of the listed report titles or descriptions indicate that a digital (e.g., GIS‐based) product was published to define the aquifer extent. The references include standard reports, peer‐reviewed articles, and open‐file publications, but do not explicitly mention a digital product containing aquifer boundaries.","Yes. The study presents and discusses a west-east hydrostratigraphic cross-section (Figure 2) that delineates the aquifer and its confining units (San Andres Formation, Artesia Group, Yeso Formation). The authors use outcrop descriptions (e.g., Pray, 1961), well-drilling observations such as lost circulation events (Havenor, 1968), and previous geologic and hydrologic mapping (Motts and Cushman, 1964; Kelley, 1971; Welder, 1983; Bachman, 1984, 1987) to characterize these units and define the hydrostratigraphy.","Yes. The study identifies the “Pecos Buckles”—wrench fault zones running SW–NE across the Pecos Slope—as a key structural control. These were defined using geologic mapping, cross-sections (Figure 2), and well-drilling observations (e.g., lost circulation, sinkholes) that reveal how faults, fractures, and solution openings guide groundwater flow.","Yes. Recharge zones were identified along the Sacramento Mountains and Pecos Slope, where losing streams and sinkholes demonstrate water entering the aquifer. Discharge zones were defined mainly by upward flow into the Pecos River and nearby wetlands. These zones were delineated using observed stream losses, well data (lost circulation, bit drops), karst features (sinkholes, solution‐enlarged fractures), and mapped groundwater flow paths shown in cross‐sections.","No. The sections provided do not include any specific quantification of recharge or discharge rates (for example, in cubic meters per day or year). They discuss how and where recharge and discharge occur (e.g., losing streams from the Sacramento Mountains, flow through karst conduits into the Pecos River), and they describe groundwater flow velocities and residence times inferred from tritium measurements. However, they do not present numerical estimates of total recharge or discharge volumes.","From the text provided, there is only reference to a west–east hydrostratigraphic cross-section (Figure 2) showing groundwater flow paths, not a specific water table elevation map or depth to water map. There is no indication that such a map was produced.","The report does not explicitly describe the exact data source for creating a water‐table or depth‐to‐water map. However, based on standard hydrogeologic practice and the references to wells (e.g., RAB‐1, RAB‐2, RAB‐3), one can reasonably infer that these maps were produced from measured water levels in wells across the area (i.e., well‐head elevations and static water‐level measurements).","The sections provided do not describe any new measurement of water levels during this study; references to water levels are taken from previous work (e.g., Welder, 1983; Land and Newton, 2007; 2008). Thus, water levels appear to have been compiled from other sources rather than newly collected for this study.","Yes. Section 5.1 (“General chemistry”) presents measured TDS and major ions (such as sulfate and chloride) for samples collected at Bitter Lake NWR, indicating that water quality data were indeed gathered and analyzed.","It was newly collected in the field specifically for this research, with various laboratories performing the analyses on those freshly obtained samples.","They were obtained by sampling groundwater and surface water features in and around Bitter Lake National Wildlife Refuge, including: (1) irrigation wells west of the Refuge (RAB‐1, RAB‐2, RAB‐3), (2) sinkhole lakes (notably “Sinkhole 59” and Lake St. Francis), and (3) a playa lake (BL‐4). These samples were analyzed for total dissolved solids, major ions, and other parameters to characterize water quality.","From the information provided, the sections discuss “secondary porosity” and explicitly note hydraulic conductivity (including a suggested value exceeding 400 m/day). Permeability is also mentioned by conversion (about 4,800 darcies). However, the text does not provide explicit values or tabulated data for storage coefficients, specific storage, specific yield, or transmissivity.","They reported a flow velocity (about 20 m/day) and an implied hydraulic conductivity (>400 m/day) for the northern Artesian Basin. These values were inferred by correlating tritium peaks in sampled well water to tritium peaks in meteoric water (Rabinowitz et al., 1977) and then calculating the travel time and flow velocity, from which hydraulic conductivity was estimated.","Based on the breadth of methods and findings cited in the references, future work on this aquifer system would benefit from:

• Expanded and continuous monitoring. Additional observation wells and more frequent sampling (including seasonally and following large recharge events) would improve understanding of variability in both water levels and water quality.  
• Enhanced tracer studies and updated age‐dating methods. Continued use of multiple tracers (e.g., tritium, CFCs, SF₆, δ¹⁸O, and ¹⁴C) in combination can refine estimates of groundwater residence times and mixing processes, especially in karst conduits.  
• Refined geochemical and flow models. Integrating isotopic data, hydraulic measurements, and geochemical modeling (using tools such as NETPATH or PHREEQC) would help delineate flow paths and reaction processes, improving the overall conceptual model of the system.  
• Investigation of recharge mechanisms and pathways. In karst systems, recharge can occur rapidly and be highly localized; further work characterizing these rapid recharge events and sinkhole influences would clarify how water enters and migrates through the aquifer.  
• Assessment of anthropogenic impacts. Because many references address potential contamination sources (e.g., nitrate in karst springs), future studies should map land use patterns more closely and quantify the influence of agriculture, industry, and urban development on aquifer water quality.  
• Long-term climate and land-use considerations. Finally, incorporating projected climate change scenarios and ongoing land-use changes would help evaluate the sustainability of the aquifer’s recharge and inform groundwater management strategies.",ofr_521.pdf
