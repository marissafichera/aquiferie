"Based on the text provided, the section appears under the heading “Effects of Forest Harvest on Water Yields” by Lee H. MacDonald, which is the closest match to a study title in the excerpt.","They focus on three closely related aquifers: the Roswell Basin shallow (alluvial) aquifer, the Roswell artesian aquifer, and the Capitan aquifer (near Carlsbad).","They present a west–east cross section (a two-dimensional slice) through the Roswell artesian basin, showing the aquifer units and confining beds. However, the text does not describe or map the full aerial (plan-view) extent of the aquifer in two dimensions.","No. The cited text does not explicitly define the base of the aquifer or the specific data used to delineate it. It indicates that the Seven Rivers and Yeso Formations act as “regional confining units,” implying that the aquifers lie above those formations, but the report does not provide details on how the base of the aquifer was specifically determined.","No. While the study used standard USGS MODFLOW software and other modeling tools, the text does not indicate that a separate, published digital product explicitly defining the aquifer extent was released.","Yes. The report identifies the San Andres as the main artesian aquifer, the Seven Rivers and Yeso Formations as confining units, and a shallower alluvial aquifer. They use geologic cross sections, formation descriptions, and well data (e.g., water levels, geologic logs) to delineate these units and thereby define the basin’s hydrostratigraphy.","No. The sections discuss which formations act as confining units and show a generalized flow pattern on a west–east cross section, but they do not explicitly define subsurface structural controls such as faults or folds. They rely on stratigraphic information (e.g., the Seven Rivers and Yeso Formations) rather than describing specific structural data to explain groundwater flow.","Yes. Although not labeled as “recharge zones” and “discharge zones” in formal headings, the text describes recharge areas (mountain fronts, rivers, streams, arroyos, and faults where precipitation infiltrates) and discharge areas (springs, wetlands, and streams where groundwater emerges). This understanding is based on observed water‐level gradients and the known pathways of precipitation infiltration into aquifers.","They do not provide specific numerical rates for any one aquifer or site, only broad estimates. The text notes that recharge from precipitation can range from 0.03% to 20% of mean annual precipitation (depending on local conditions), and mentions typical groundwater flow rates, but does not cite the exact data or methods used to derive these estimates. There are no direct, detailed discharge values or tabulated numbers in the text.",No. The text only describes a west‑east cross section illustrating groundwater flow and aquifer relationships. It does not mention producing a water table elevation map or a depth to water map.,They are based on water-level measurements taken from wells completed in the aquifer; those measured values are then mapped or contoured to show water-table elevation or depth to water across the basin.,"The text does not mention new water‐level measurements being collected specifically for this study. Instead, it indicates that the agencies (OSE/ISC) rely on data provided by the USGS and other entities (irrigation districts, federal agencies), suggesting that the information was compiled from existing sources rather than newly collected.","No. Although the report discusses water quality issues and the concept of total maximum daily load (TMDL), it does not provide specific water quality measurements or data.","It appears that the study primarily used existing historical data records—such as gage measurements, pumping data, and meteorologic records from 1967 to 1996—rather than gathering entirely new data specifically for this project.","They are not explicitly listed in the text. However, based on the discussion of TMDLs and the role of the Surface Water Quality Bureau (New Mexico Environment Department), one can infer that water quality data primarily come from state-led monitoring efforts under the Bureau’s programs and any related TMDL studies. Additional data may be gathered through local watershed assessments and other environmental monitoring activities referenced by the Bureau.","No. The text discusses concepts like porosity and mentions that limestone aquifers have “relatively small storage capacity” and transmit water rapidly, but it does not provide quantitative or specific hydrogeologic properties (e.g., numerical values or defined hydraulic conductivity, transmissivity, etc.).",N/A,"Future work centers on gathering all stakeholders within each river basin and aquifer to collectively negotiate and plan realistic solutions, underpinned by reliable data and clear legal frameworks. Key recommendations include:

• Formal Negotiation/Planning: Bring together water users (e.g., irrigation districts, municipalities, industry, environmental groups) with facilitation by the state. Motivating factors—such as unavoidable legal or supply constraints—are essential for achieving agreement.  
• Water Rights Analysis: Compile accurate, up-to-date water-rights information (quantities, priorities, diversion points, places of use) to guide fair and feasible reallocation decisions.  
• Regulatory and Technical Support: The State Engineer’s Office and the Interstate Stream Commission should provide hydrologic data, adopt rules for water distribution, and assist with system modeling.  
• Measurement and Enforcement: Install metering systems for all diversions. Enforce usage limits and redirect out-of-priority users.  
• Funding and Investments: Support local water administration (e.g., river masters, measurement programs), encourage efficiency improvements, and develop robust models and monitoring programs.  
• Policy Tools: Enable priority administration if negotiations fail, streamline market reallocations (particularly from irrigation to other uses), and protect legitimate environmental flows to reduce federal intervention.",DecisonMakers2003.pdf
