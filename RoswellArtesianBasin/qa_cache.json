  "Did the study define the aquifer extent in 2D?|||From the excerpts provided, the report shows a west\u2013east cross section (a vertical slice) illustrating aquifers and confining units. While this is indeed a two\u2010dimensional depiction, it is not a map view defining the full horizontal (areal) extent of the aquifer. The text does not appear to present a plan\u2010view boundary or full 2D extent; it focuses on the vertical geologic relationships and a schematic of flow patterns.": "no",
  "Did the study define the aquifer extent in 2D?|||Yes. The study includes a regional map (Figure 1) depicting the approximate extent of the Roswell Artesian Basin in plan view, thus defining the aquifer\u2019s 2D extent.": "yes",
  "Did the study define the aquifer extent in 2D?|||The excerpt does not explicitly state how the aquifer\u2019s boundaries were defined. While the report references a \u201ccompartmental mixing cell model\u201d for groundwater flow, it does not clearly say if the aquifer extent was defined in two dimensions. Therefore, based on the provided text alone, it is unclear whether the study included a 2D boundary definition.": "no",
  "Did the study define the aquifer extent in 2D?|||No. While they present conceptual cross sections and discuss the regional flow regime, the report does not provide a two\u2010dimensional delineation of the aquifer\u2019s boundaries. Instead, it focuses on the speleogenetic processes and conceptual flow models rather than explicitly mapping a 2D aquifer extent.": "no",
  "Did the study define the aquifer extent in 2D?|||Yes. They provide a map (Figure\u202f1) outlining the Roswell Artesian Basin and discuss its boundaries in plan view, so the aquifer extent is indeed defined in two dimensions.": "yes",
  "Did the study define the base of the aquifer? If yes, what data was used to define the base of the aquifer?|||No. The text does not explicitly define where the base of the aquifer lies or what specific data were used to delineate it. While it does note that the Seven Rivers and Yeso Formations act as confining units, it does not provide details on precisely how the aquifer\u2019s lower boundary was determined.": "no",
  "Did the study define the base of the aquifer? If yes, what data was used to define the base of the aquifer?|||No. The excerpts do not explicitly describe how the aquifer\u2019s base was determined. While they discuss the aquifer\u2019s thickness (e.g., San Andres ~350 m thick east of the Pecos River), there is no clear statement about the method or data used to define the formation\u2019s lower boundary.": "no",
  "Did the study define the base of the aquifer? If yes, what data was used to define the base of the aquifer?|||The provided excerpt does not explicitly mention how the study defines the base of the aquifer. It focuses on a \u03b418O-compartmental model of groundwater flow but does not detail the geologic or data sources for establishing aquifer boundaries. It is therefore unclear from the snippet whether or how the base of the aquifer was defined.": "no",
  "Did the study define the base of the aquifer? If yes, what data was used to define the base of the aquifer?|||No. The report does not explicitly address or define the base of the aquifer. It focuses on the cave\u2019s formation, morphology, and regional stratigraphy but does not present specific data used to delineate where the aquifer terminates.": "no",
  "Did the study define the base of the aquifer? If yes, what data was used to define the base of the aquifer?|||From the text provided, the study treats the top of the Glorieta Sandstone (the basal member of the San Andres Formation) as the lower boundary of the artesian aquifer. They cite earlier work (e.g., Kinney et al. 1968; Welder 1983), which relied on geologic mapping and well data to identify that contact as the aquifer\u2019s base.": "yes",
  "Did the study define the hydrostratigraphy of the aquifer? If yes, what data was used to define the hydrostratigraphy?|||Yes. The study describes the San Andres artesian aquifer and the shallow alluvial aquifer, with the Seven Rivers and Yeso Formations as regional confining units, defining the overall hydrostratigraphy in the Roswell artesian basin. This is based on geologic cross sections (including the west\u2013east section shown) and well data indicating how water-bearing units and confining beds are arranged.": "yes",
  "Did the study define the hydrostratigraphy of the aquifer? If yes, what data was used to define the hydrostratigraphy?|||Yes. The paper describes the Roswell Artesian Basin as consisting of an eastward-dipping San Andres/Grayburg carbonate aquifer overlain by a \u201cleaky\u201d confining unit (the upper Grayburg, Queen, and Seven Rivers Formations), which in turn is overlain by an unconfined alluvial aquifer. This stratigraphy was defined using regional geologic mapping and cross sections (Figures 1\u20133), as well as earlier published work (e.g., Bachman, Reeves, Welder) on well logs, stratigraphic thinning, and dissolution features in the basin.": "yes",
  "Did the study define the hydrostratigraphy of the aquifer? If yes, what data was used to define the hydrostratigraphy?|||The excerpt provided does not explicitly describe how the study defined the aquifer\u2019s hydrostratigraphy. However, given that the report focuses on a \u03b418O\u2010based compartmental mixing cell model, it is likely the author relied on stable isotope measurements (\u03b418O), alongside well\u2010based or geological data, to delineate hydrostratigraphic units. The specific data used are not detailed in the snippet.": "no",
  "Did the study define the hydrostratigraphy of the aquifer? If yes, what data was used to define the hydrostratigraphy?|||From the text provided, the authors discuss the stratigraphy (e.g., gypsum sequences, dolomite caps) and regional hydrology but do not formally establish or detail a layered hydrostratigraphic framework. They describe the geology and mention that Coffee Cave developed in a confined aquifer system, yet they do not explicitly lay out or name the aquifer units (e.g., via well logs or cross sections). Thus, while the paper addresses the geologic and hydrologic setting, it does not clearly define the aquifer\u2019s hydrostratigraphy in a systematic manner.": "no",
  "Did the study define the hydrostratigraphy of the aquifer? If yes, what data was used to define the hydrostratigraphy?|||Yes. The paper describes a two\u2010aquifer system (artesian and shallow), showing the confining beds and key formations (e.g., San Andres, Grayburg, Glorieta) in a west\u2010to\u2010east cross\u2010section (Figure 2). They relied on earlier investigations (Fiedler and Nye, Welder, etc.), well data, geologic mapping, and thickness/stratigraphic information (e.g., from Kelley 1971) to delineate these hydrostratigraphic units.": "yes",
  "Did the study define subsurface structural controls on groundwater flow? If yes, what data was used to define the structural controls?|||No. The text does not explicitly describe subsurface faults or other structural features controlling flow. It focuses instead on how the Seven Rivers and Yeso Formations act as confining units, showing generalized flow in a cross section. There is no direct mention of specific structural data (e.g., from well logs or seismic surveys) used to define any subsurface structural controls.": "no",
  "Did the study define subsurface structural controls on groundwater flow? If yes, what data was used to define the structural controls?|||From the information provided, the paper does discuss the role of the eastward dip of Permian strata, as well as solution\u2010enlarged fractures and breccias, in guiding groundwater flow. However, it does not appear to introduce new, specific \u201cstructural\u201d data (e.g., detailed fault mapping or seismic surveys). Rather, the study references existing cross-sections (including one modified from an unpublished 1967 report) and prior geological work (e.g., Bachman, 1987) to describe how subsurface dissolution, solution breccias, and regional stratigraphic thinning influence the aquifer\u2019s flow regime.": "no",
  "Did the study define subsurface structural controls on groundwater flow? If yes, what data was used to define the structural controls?|||From the provided excerpt, there is no discussion of subsurface structural controls or the data used to define them. The study\u2019s focus (as described) is on calibrating a compartmental mixing cell model with \u03b418O data. There is no mention of any structural analysis or related datasets in the text you shared.": "no",
  "Did the study define subsurface structural controls on groundwater flow? If yes, what data was used to define the structural controls?|||From the text provided, the authors do note that the cave\u2019s development was influenced by gentle regional dip (1\u20132\u00b0), broad flexures, and abundant high-angle fractures and joints with minimal offset. However, they did not present new subsurface seismic or borehole data to delineate these structural controls. Instead, they inferred the importance of structural pathways (fractures, flexures) to ascending groundwater flow primarily through field observations of cave morphology (e.g., feeders, rising channels) and the known regional geologic setting.": "no",
  "Did the study define subsurface structural controls on groundwater flow? If yes, what data was used to define the structural controls?|||From the descriptions provided, the authors do recognize that groundwater flow is strongly influenced by the basin\u2019s eastward-dipping stratigraphy and the transition from carbonate to evaporitic rocks\u2014i.e., what could be termed the \u201cstructural framework\u201d of the Roswell Artesian Basin. They rely on geologic cross-sections (Figures 2 and 3), well data (e.g., thicknesses and depths of producing zones), and earlier mapping (such as Welder, 1983) to delineate these subsurface controls. While they do not highlight specific faults or folds, their hydrostratigraphic sections and discussions of solution-collapse features and confining boundaries show that subsurface structure (mainly the dip and facies changes) is used to define how groundwater moves through the carbonate aquifer system.": "yes",
  "Did the study define recharge and discharge zones? If yes, what data was used to define recharge and discharge zones?|||Yes. The text describes recharge zones as areas where water enters the aquifer\u2014such as mountains, rivers, arroyos, and faults\u2014and discharge zones as areas where groundwater leaves the aquifer\u2014such as springs, wetlands, and streams. Although the report does not cite specific measurement methods, it indicates that factors like soil or rock type, topography, vegetation, and climate are used to estimate or identify where recharge and discharge occur.": "yes",
  "Did the study define recharge and discharge zones? If yes, what data was used to define recharge and discharge zones?|||Yes. The study identifies the overflow wetland west of Lea Lake as a localized recharge zone for the shallow alluvial aquifer, which in turn discharges into the Pecos River. This conclusion is based on measured flow increases from Lea Lake (including the highest recorded flow in January 2003), observations that the wetland is hydraulically connected to the river, and written communication (M. McGee, 2003) indicating that water from the wetland ultimately enters the river.": "yes",
  "Did the study define recharge and discharge zones? If yes, what data was used to define recharge and discharge zones?|||From the title and focus on a \u03b418O compartmental mixing cell model of groundwater flow, it is reasonable to infer that the study did identify general recharge and discharge zones. The stable isotope (\u03b418O) measurements, combined with a compartmental flow model, were almost certainly central to defining where water enters (recharge zones) and leaves (discharge zones) the Roswell Basin system.": "yes",
  "Did the study define recharge and discharge zones? If yes, what data was used to define recharge and discharge zones?|||The report does not explicitly list \u201crecharge zone\u201d and \u201cdischarge zone\u201d in so many words, but it does outline where groundwater enters (via overlying formations and alluvium) and exits (toward the Pecos River and breached cave passages). These zones are inferred largely from conceptual cross\u2010sections of groundwater flow (Figures 13C, 13D, and 13E) and supporting hydrologic data\u2014particularly the water\u2010level and tracer studies cited in references by Land (2003, 2005, 2006, 2007). Thus, although the discussion is primarily conceptual, the authors rely on hydrologic measurements and environmental\u2010tracer work in the lower Pecos region to delineate where water is recharging and where it is discharging.": "no",
  "Did the study define recharge and discharge zones? If yes, what data was used to define recharge and discharge zones?|||Yes. They identify recharge in the western outcrop areas (particularly in the eastern Sacramento and Guadalupe Mountains) and discharge along the Pecos River, where springs, sinkhole lakes, and wetlands appear. The authors used well\u2010level measurements, geologic mapping (including outcrop and confining\u2010unit boundaries), and observed natural discharge (springs, lakes, and wetland areas) to delineate these zones.": "yes",
  "Did the study quantify recharge and discharge rates or amounts? If yes, what data was used to quantify recharge and discharge rates or amounts?|||They provided only a rough range for recharge (0.03% to 20% of mean annual precipitation), attributed to factors like soil or rock type, topography, vegetation, and climate. The document does not specify actual measured discharge rates or the exact data sets used to quantify either recharge or discharge; it merely indicates that recharge estimates come from precipitation and environmental conditions rather than offering detailed numeric discharge figures.": "no",
  "Did the study quantify recharge and discharge rates or amounts? If yes, what data was used to quantify recharge and discharge rates or amounts?|||Yes. They measured Lea Lake\u2019s outflow (discharge) using USGS flow measurements at the lake drain (for example, 0.53 m\u00b3/s on January 13, 2003) and tracked artesian\u2010aquifer water levels at the nearby Orchard Park monitoring well. From these measurements they also inferred the total annual discharge (about 8.5 million m\u00b3/year). There is no explicit numerical recharge rate given, although rising water\u2010level data in the aquifer indicate increased recharge over time.": "yes",
  "Did the study quantify recharge and discharge rates or amounts? If yes, what data was used to quantify recharge and discharge rates or amounts?|||Based on the excerpt, the study likely uses \u03b418O (oxygen-18) isotope data in a compartmental mixing cell model to estimate groundwater flow in the Roswell Basin. While the snippet does not provide explicit numbers, it strongly suggests that recharge and discharge were quantified using \u03b418O measurements to calibrate the model.": "yes",
  "Did the study quantify recharge and discharge rates or amounts? If yes, what data was used to quantify recharge and discharge rates or amounts?|||No. The sections provided do not report any quantitative measurement of recharge or discharge rates. They describe conceptual models of groundwater flow and circulation but do not present data (e.g., flow measurements or tracer analysis results) to explicitly quantify recharge or discharge amounts.": "no",
  "Did the study quantify recharge and discharge rates or amounts? If yes, what data was used to quantify recharge and discharge rates or amounts?|||Yes. The paper cites previous work (e.g., Barroll and Shomaker, 2003) indicating that natural discharge from the artesian aquifer is about 37 million cubic meters per year. It also references Hantush (1957) for estimates that withdrawals exceeded recharge by roughly 308 million cubic meters per year. These figures come from earlier investigations (USGS, NM Office of the State Engineer metering, and other historical well/streamflow data) rather than from the authors\u2019 own new direct measurements.": "yes",
  "Did the study produce water table elevation, depth to water, piezometric surface, or potentiometric surface maps?|||The excerpts refer to a west\u2013east cross section and present conceptual diagrams (including one with arrows indicating groundwater flow), but they do not explicitly mention or show any water-table elevation maps, depth-to-water maps, or piezometric/potentiometric surface maps. Therefore, based on the sections provided, there is no indication that such maps were produced.": "no",
  "Did the study produce water table elevation, depth to water, piezometric surface, or potentiometric surface maps?|||No. The report does not mention or depict any water\u2010table, depth\u2010to\u2010water, piezometric, or potentiometric surface maps. It only discusses measured water levels (via monitoring well data) and lake discharge trends without including any such mapping.": "no",
  "Did the study produce water table elevation, depth to water, piezometric surface, or potentiometric surface maps?|||The provided section does not explicitly mention the creation of water table elevation, depth to water, piezometric surface, or potentiometric surface maps. While such products are common in groundwater flow studies, the excerpt does not confirm whether they were generated in this case.": "no",
  "Did the study produce water table elevation, depth to water, piezometric surface, or potentiometric surface maps?|||From the text provided, there is no indication that the authors produced actual water\u2010table\u2010elevation, depth\u2010to\u2010water, piezometric\u2010surface, or potentiometric\u2010surface maps. Instead, they presented conceptual (schematic) illustrations of groundwater flow and hydrologic regimes, rather than mapped surfaces of those parameters.": "no",
  "Did the study produce water table elevation, depth to water, piezometric surface, or potentiometric surface maps?|||The report states that \u201cPotentiometric surface maps were constructed based on water level data.\u201d So, the study specifically produced potentiometric surface maps.": "yes",
  "Does the study include water chemistry data (e.g. major ions, isotopes, pH, salinity, specific conductance)?|||No. Although it describes saline waters and notes high mineral content, there is no explicit mention or presentation of detailed water chemistry data (major ions, isotopes, pH, salinity, specific conductance) in the sections provided.": "no",
  "Does the study include water chemistry data (e.g. major ions, isotopes, pH, salinity, specific conductance)?|||Yes. Although not exhaustive, the report does provide some water-chemistry details, particularly salinity and chloride concentration ranges (e.g., 15 to 7,000 ppm chloride) and notes on sulfate enrichment in the Bottomless Lakes. It does not explicitly mention parameters such as isotopes, pH, or specific conductance.": "yes",
  "Does the study include water chemistry data (e.g. major ions, isotopes, pH, salinity, specific conductance)?|||Based on the excerpt, the study explicitly includes stable isotope data (\u03b418O). While it does not specifically mention major ions, pH, salinity, or specific conductance, it is at least clear that isotopic water chemistry data are part of the study.": "yes",
  "Does the study include water chemistry data (e.g. major ions, isotopes, pH, salinity, specific conductance)?|||No. The sections provided focus on speleogenetic processes, geology, and cave morphology, but do not present or discuss specific water chemistry data (such as major ions, isotopes, pH, salinity, or specific conductance).": "no",
  "Does the study include water chemistry data (e.g. major ions, isotopes, pH, salinity, specific conductance)?|||Yes. The study specifically presents chloride and total dissolved solids (TDS) data, along with overall salinity trends. However, it does not describe other major ions, isotopes, pH, or specific conductance in the excerpt provided.": "yes",
  "Does the study report specific hydrogeologic properties such as porosity, permeability, storage coefficients, specific storage, specific yield, hydraulic conductivity, and/or transmissivity?|||They refer generally to porosity and the capacity of different rock types to store and transmit water (e.g., noting that limestone transmits water rapidly but has relatively small storage), but they do not provide specific numerical values or detailed parameters like permeability, storage coefficients, specific yield, hydraulic conductivity, or transmissivity.": "no",
  "Does the study report specific hydrogeologic properties such as porosity, permeability, storage coefficients, specific storage, specific yield, hydraulic conductivity, and/or transmissivity?|||No direct mention of those specific hydrogeologic properties appears in the cited sections. While Welder\u2019s (1983) \u201cGeohydrologic framework of the Roswell ground-water basin\u201d could potentially include them, the excerpt itself does not explicitly state porosity, permeability, storage coefficients, specific storage, specific yield, hydraulic conductivity, or transmissivity.": "no",
  "Does the study report specific hydrogeologic properties such as porosity, permeability, storage coefficients, specific storage, specific yield, hydraulic conductivity, and/or transmissivity?|||No. The provided excerpt focuses on the \u03b418O mixing cell model and does not mention specific hydrogeologic properties (porosity, permeability, etc.). While the full study may include them, they are not reported in the text shown here.": "no",
  "Does the study report specific hydrogeologic properties such as porosity, permeability, storage coefficients, specific storage, specific yield, hydraulic conductivity, and/or transmissivity?|||No. None of the cited report sections give explicit values or discussions of porosity, permeability, storage coefficients, or similar parameters. They address broader hydrogeologic and geomorphic aspects but do not present those specific properties.": "no",
  "Does the study report specific hydrogeologic properties such as porosity, permeability, storage coefficients, specific storage, specific yield, hydraulic conductivity, and/or transmissivity?|||No, the sections do not cite specific measured values (e.g., numeric porosity, permeability, storage coefficients, etc.). They do describe the aquifer as being \u201chighly porous and transmissive\u201d with notable secondary porosity, but numerical hydrogeologic properties are not provided. The text instead focuses on the geologic framework, zones of water production, and general well yields.": "no",
  "Did the study define the aquifer extent in 2D?|||Yes. The text references Figure 1 for the location and extent of the Roswell Artesian Basin and also discusses regional thickening of confining beds, which implies a mapped (2D) definition of the aquifer\u2019s boundaries.": "yes",
  "Did the study define the aquifer extent in 2D?|||Yes. The text references Figure 1 as showing the cross-section\u2019s location and indicates that the aquifer extent and flow paths are illustrated (in plan view and cross-section) in Figures 1 and 2, suggesting the study does define the aquifer\u2019s two-dimensional extent.": "yes",
  "Did the study define the aquifer extent in 2D?|||The text does not indicate that a specific 2D boundary map was drawn or formally defined. Although it mentions the study area extends over roughly 35,000 km\u00b2 and references a stratigraphic figure (Fig. 2), there is no explicit statement that a discrete 2D aquifer extent was delineated in plan view. Instead, the discussion focuses on hydrochemical facies and stratigraphic units rather than providing a detailed two\u2010dimensional aquifer boundary.": "no",
  "Did the study define the aquifer extent in 2D?|||Yes. The report describes the aquifer\u2019s boundaries (western, eastern, and southern) and convergence in plan view, effectively outlining its 2D extent.": "yes",
  "Did the study define the aquifer extent in 2D?|||Yes. While the text mostly describes a west-east cross section (Figure 2), it also references \u201cFigure 1\u201d for the location of that section, implying that the aquifer\u2019s areal extent is mapped in two dimensions.": "yes",
  "Did the study define the aquifer extent in 2D?|||They did not explicitly label it as a \u201c2D aquifer extent,\u201d but the studies incorporate geologic mapping of the Bitter Lake area (e.g., McCraw et al. 2007) and typically show the aquifer\u2019s areal distribution on maps. Thus, in practical terms, the aquifer was defined in a two-dimensional sense.": "no",
  "Did the study define the base of the aquifer? If yes, what data was used to define the base of the aquifer?|||No. The excerpt does not explicitly define where or how the base of the aquifer was determined. It describes the aquifer as eastward-dipping San Andres carbonates overlain by evaporites (the Artesia Group), but does not discuss data or methods used to define a lower boundary for the aquifer.": "no",
  "Did the study define the base of the aquifer? If yes, what data was used to define the base of the aquifer?|||No. The report does not explicitly define or describe how the aquifer\u2019s base was determined. The authors identify the San Andres Formation as the main artesian (carbonate) aquifer, overlain by evaporites and surficial alluvium, but there is no specific discussion or dataset provided for defining the aquifer\u2019s lower boundary.": "no",
  "Did the study define the base of the aquifer? If yes, what data was used to define the base of the aquifer?|||They do not explicitly define a \u201cbase of the aquifer,\u201d but they do note that the Yeso Formation serves as the lower confining unit for the artesian part of the system. The text does not specify any direct method or data (e.g., geophysical logs) that were used to identify that boundary, only that past work (e.g., Havenor 1996, Kelley 1971) and the recognized stratigraphic framework indicate the Yeso forms the confining layer beneath the San Andres Formation.": "yes",
  "Did the study define the base of the aquifer? If yes, what data was used to define the base of the aquifer?|||From the description provided, the study adopts the longstanding view that the base of the Roswell Basin\u2019s artesian aquifer is marked by the top of the Yeso Formation (the underlying confining unit). Although the authors do not detail new methods for defining that base, they cite prior reports (e.g., Kinney et al., 1968; Welder, 1983) in describing the Yeso as the lower boundary and the Glorieta sandstone as the basal member of the overlying San Andres Formation.": "yes",
  "Did the study define the base of the aquifer? If yes, what data was used to define the base of the aquifer?|||Yes. They identify the lower confining unit (and thus the effective base) as the siltstones and gypsum of the Yeso Formation. This is shown in the west\u2013east hydrostratigraphic cross-section (Figure 2) and is based on geologic mapping and prior investigations (e.g., Welder, 1983).": "yes",
  "Did the study define the base of the aquifer? If yes, what data was used to define the base of the aquifer?|||No. None of the listed sources explicitly establish the aquifer\u2019s base or describe the data used for delineating it. They do not detail a stratigraphic horizon, confining unit, or other boundary that would define the base of the aquifer.": "no",
  "Did the study define the hydrostratigraphy of the aquifer? If yes, what data was used to define the hydrostratigraphy?|||Yes. The paper presents a west\u2010east hydrostratigraphic cross\u2010section (Figure 2) and describes the aquifer\u2019s structure and stratigraphy (e.g., carbonate aquifer overlain by evaporites) using well\u2010drilling observations (lost circulation, bit drops), outcrop descriptions from earlier work (e.g., Pray, 1961), and existing geologic reports (e.g., Fiedler and Nye, 1933; Morgan and Sayer, 1942). This combination of drilling data, outcrop studies, and published research was used to define the hydrostratigraphy.": "yes",
  "Did the study define the hydrostratigraphy of the aquifer? If yes, what data was used to define the hydrostratigraphy?|||Yes. They present a west\u2013east cross-section (Figure 2) showing the carbonate aquifer, overlying confining unit, and the shallow alluvial aquifer. In defining this hydrostratigraphy, the study draws on previous investigations (e.g., Fiedler and Nye, 1933; Morgan and Sayer, 1942), outcrop descriptions of the San Andres Formation, and subsurface evidence from drilling (e.g., lost-circulation zones and solution-collapse breccias).": "yes",
  "Did the study define the hydrostratigraphy of the aquifer? If yes, what data was used to define the hydrostratigraphy?|||Yes. In the background section, the authors explicitly outline the basin\u2019s stratigraphy (e.g., Yeso, San Andres, Artesia formations) and identify which units serve as confining layers or principal aquifers. They base this hydrostratigraphic framework on references to earlier work by Havenor (1996) and Kelley (1971), supported by drillers\u2019 logs and formation descriptions (lithology, thickness, and depositional environment).": "yes",
  "Did the study define the hydrostratigraphy of the aquifer? If yes, what data was used to define the hydrostratigraphy?|||Yes. They used geologic mapping, subsurface well data (including logs), and cross-sectional profiles (Figures 2 and 3) to define and illustrate the two-aquifer system (artesian versus shallow), the intervening confining layers, and the lateral facies changes that control aquifer permeability.": "yes",
  "Did the study define the hydrostratigraphy of the aquifer? If yes, what data was used to define the hydrostratigraphy?|||Yes. The study presents a west\u2013east hydrostratigraphic cross-section (Figure 2) and describes the aquifer\u2019s confining units (Artesia Group and Yeso Formation), outcrop observations (San Andres Formation in the Sacramento Mountains), and well-drilling evidence (lost-circulation zones and bit drops). These data\u2014along with prior geologic and hydrologic investigations\u2014were used to define the aquifer\u2019s hydrostratigraphy.": "yes",
  "Did the study define the hydrostratigraphy of the aquifer? If yes, what data was used to define the hydrostratigraphy?|||Yes. From the references, particularly McCraw et al. (2007) and Land and Huff (2010a, 2010b), the authors relied on geologic mapping (e.g., the Bitter Lake Quadrangle map) and their tracer-based hydrogeologic investigations to establish the aquifer\u2019s hydrostratigraphy. This included interpreting formations identified in the geologic map and linking them with tracer and well data to delineate the aquifer units.": "yes",
  "Did the study define subsurface structural controls on groundwater flow? If yes, what data was used to define the structural controls?|||Yes. The study identifies wrench fault zones (\"Pecos Buckles\") and solution\u2010collapse features as major structural controls on groundwater flow. It bases these interpretations on field data (mapping of sinkholes, solution\u2010enlarged fractures, breccia zones) and drilling logs (lost circulation and \u201cbit drops\u201d) that reveal cavernous pathways in the limestone.": "yes",
  "Did the study define subsurface structural controls on groundwater flow? If yes, what data was used to define the structural controls?|||Yes. In particular, the text identifies the \u201cPecos Buckles\u201d (wrench fault zones) as key structural controls on groundwater flow. These faults were defined from published geologic investigations, field observations (such as sinkholes and solution\u2010enlarged fractures), and the west\u2013east hydrostratigraphic cross\u2011section data (Figures 1 and 2) showing how recharge and flow paths align with the faulted zones.": "yes",
  "Did the study define subsurface structural controls on groundwater flow? If yes, what data was used to define the structural controls?|||No. The report excerpt does not describe or define any specific subsurface structural controls\u2014such as faults or folds\u2014on groundwater flow. It focuses on overall stratigraphy (e.g., confining units, formation contacts, lithologies) and hydrochemical facies rather than structural features, and there is no mention of data (e.g., geophysical surveys, fault maps) used to interpret structural controls.": "no",
  "Did the study define subsurface structural controls on groundwater flow? If yes, what data was used to define the structural controls?|||Yes. The study cites a steep hydraulic gradient near the KM Fault in the southern part of the basin as evidence of subsurface structural influence on flow. These structural controls were identified through analysis of potentiometric surface maps based on water-level measurements (from USGS, NM-OSE, PVACD, and NMBGMR), along with historical data sets (USGS/OSE records) collected mainly during winter months. The KM Fault\u2019s position and inferred right-lateral/normal motion were correlated with groundwater-level contours and the pronounced bend of the Pecos River, linking it to a clear structural effect on aquifer flow.": "yes",
  "Did the study define subsurface structural controls on groundwater flow? If yes, what data was used to define the structural controls?|||Yes. They identify fault\u2010related \u201cPecos Buckles\u201d and other solution\u2010enlarged fractures as structural controls on flow. The evidence comes primarily from geologic mapping (Figures 1 and 2), well\u2010drilling observations (lost circulation, bit drops), and earlier investigations (e.g., Motts and Cushman, 1964; Havenor, 1968; Kelly, 1971) documenting these fault zones and karst features.": "yes",
  "Did the study define subsurface structural controls on groundwater flow? If yes, what data was used to define the structural controls?|||No. The report sections do not describe any explicit structural (fault\u2010 or fracture\u2010related) controls on groundwater flow. They focus on water\u2010chemistry data (conductivity, TDS, pH, and ion analyses), supported by Piper plots, Stiff diagrams, and other hydrochemical indicators, rather than structural or geophysical data that would define subsurface controls.": "no",
  "Did the study define recharge and discharge zones? If yes, what data was used to define recharge and discharge zones?|||Yes. The principal recharge zone is on the Pecos Slope, where runoff from intermittent losing streams (originating in the Sacramento Mountains) and sinkholes contribute water to the aquifer. Discharge zones are along the Pecos River and nearby wetlands, where groundwater flows upward through leaky confining beds. Flow directions, field observations of losing streams, and the presence of sinkholes and solution channels were used to define these recharge and discharge zones.": "yes",
  "Did the study define recharge and discharge zones? If yes, what data was used to define recharge and discharge zones?|||Yes. The study identifies the Pecos Slope (where streams originating in the Sacramento Mountains lose flow) as the main recharge zone and the Pecos River (and nearby wetlands) as the principal discharge area. This determination is based on observed losing streams, cross\u2010sectional hydrogeologic data, and evidence of groundwater upwelling through confining beds and sinkholes into the river valley.": "yes",
  "Did the study define recharge and discharge zones? If yes, what data was used to define recharge and discharge zones?|||No. The excerpt does not explicitly identify or describe any recharge or discharge zones in the aquifer, nor does it indicate how such zones might be delineated based on the study\u2019s data. The text focuses on defining and assessing hydrochemical facies, rather than locating or characterizing recharge and discharge areas.": "no",
  "Did the study define recharge and discharge zones? If yes, what data was used to define recharge and discharge zones?|||Yes. The western outcrop area (the Pecos Slope) was identified as the main recharge zone, and the area near the Pecos River to the east was identified as the principal discharge zone. The study used hydrostratigraphic sections (Figure 2), observed groundwater\u2010flow directions (arrows in Figure 2), and potentiometric (water\u2010level) data from wells to delineate these recharge and discharge areas.": "yes",
  "Did the study define recharge and discharge zones? If yes, what data was used to define recharge and discharge zones?|||Yes. The study designates the \u201cPrincipal Intake Area\u201d for recharge along the Pecos Slope, where intermittent losing streams from the Sacramento Mountains infiltrate the karstic San Andres Limestone. Discharge zones are identified where groundwater flows upward through the Artesia Group confining beds into the alluvial aquifer and ultimately into the Pecos River and nearby wetlands. These zones were defined primarily by observing streamflows that disappear (lose water to the subsurface), well\u2010drilling data (e.g., lost circulation indicating cavernous zones), and the presence of solution channels and sinkholes in the confining units.": "yes",
  "Did the study define recharge and discharge zones? If yes, what data was used to define recharge and discharge zones?|||No. The text does not explicitly identify or map out \u201crecharge\u201d or \u201cdischarge\u201d zones. Although the report discusses \u201crecharging groundwater\u201d (e.g., dissolution of gypsum and halite) and implies that the springs serve as discharge points, it never formally defines or delineates distinct recharge and discharge zones based on specific data.": "no",
  "Did the study quantify recharge and discharge rates or amounts? If yes, what data was used to quantify recharge and discharge rates or amounts?|||No. The sections provided describe sources of recharge (primarily losing streams, sinkholes, and solution\u2010enlarged fractures) and note that groundwater ultimately discharges to the Pecos River and adjacent wetlands, but they do not present explicit measurements or calculations of recharge or discharge volumes or rates. Instead, they focus on flow paths, hydraulic ages, and isotope residence times rather than quantifying amounts of water entering or leaving the aquifer.": "no",
  "Did the study quantify recharge and discharge rates or amounts? If yes, what data was used to quantify recharge and discharge rates or amounts?|||No. The report sections provided do not give any direct measurements or numerical estimates of recharge or discharge rates. They describe recharge mechanisms (e.g., intermittent losing streams, sinkholes) and directions of groundwater flow, but do not present quantified flow or discharge values.": "no",
  "Did the study quantify recharge and discharge rates or amounts? If yes, what data was used to quantify recharge and discharge rates or amounts?|||Yes. The text notes an estimated recharge of about 370 million m\u00b3/year (from Barroll and Shomaker 2003). This estimate is based on direct infiltration of precipitation, runoff from intermittent streams extending from the Sacramento Mountains, and (for the shallower zones) factors such as irrigation return flow and upward leakage from deeper units. The text does not explicitly provide a quantified discharge rate.": "yes",
  "Did the study quantify recharge and discharge rates or amounts? If yes, what data was used to quantify recharge and discharge rates or amounts?|||No. In the sections provided, the study\u2019s methods and findings regarding recharge or discharge rates are not explicitly quantified. The text discusses overall groundwater flow and aquifer characteristics but does not cite specific data or measurements for recharge or discharge amounts.": "no",
  "Did the study quantify recharge and discharge rates or amounts? If yes, what data was used to quantify recharge and discharge rates or amounts?|||No. In the portions of the report that were provided, there is general discussion of recharge processes (e.g., losing streams from the Sacramento Mountains, sinkholes in the Pecos Slope) and discharge pathways (upward leakage through confining layers, direct flow into the Pecos River), but no specific rates or volumes for recharge or discharge are given.": "no",
  "Did the study quantify recharge and discharge rates or amounts? If yes, what data was used to quantify recharge and discharge rates or amounts?|||No. The sections provided do not mention any direct measurement or calculation of groundwater recharge or discharge rates. They focus on water chemistry (e.g., ion concentrations, TDS, conductivity, pH) and do not include data quantifying the volumes or rates of water entering or leaving the aquifer.": "no",
  "Did the study produce water table elevation, depth to water, piezometric surface, or potentiometric surface maps?|||No. From the excerpts provided, the authors only show a west\u2013east hydrostratigraphic cross-section (Figure 2) illustrating groundwater flow paths. There is no indication that they produced water table, depth-to-water, piezometric, or potentiometric surface maps.": "no",
  "Did the study produce water table elevation, depth to water, piezometric surface, or potentiometric surface maps?|||From the sections provided, there is no indication that the authors produced or included water table, depth\u2010to\u2010water, piezometric, or potentiometric surface maps. The figures described (Figure 1 and Figure 2) are limited to a regional location map and a cross\u2010section, respectively. Therefore, based on the text, such maps were not presented in this study.": "no",
  "Did the study produce water table elevation, depth to water, piezometric surface, or potentiometric surface maps?|||They do not explicitly mention having produced water\u2010level (water table or potentiometric) maps. The text refers to a 3D structure map (Fig. 4) showing fault blocks in the San Andres Formation and a general hydrology figure (Fig. 3), but it does not state that the study generated water table elevation, depth\u2010to\u2010water, or piezometric surface maps.": "no",
  "Did the study produce water table elevation, depth to water, piezometric surface, or potentiometric surface maps?|||From the text, it appears that the investigators measured hydraulic heads in the shallow and artesian aquifers and produced maps of the potentiometric (piezometric) surfaces, rather than simple water\u2010table or depth\u2010to\u2010water maps.": "no",
  "Did the study produce water table elevation, depth to water, piezometric surface, or potentiometric surface maps?|||No. The excerpts only describe a hydrostratigraphic cross\u2010section (Figure 2) and do not mention producing water table or potentiometric surface maps. They show a conceptual west\u2013east cross\u2010section illustrating flow paths, but there is no explicit reference to maps of water levels or piezometric surfaces.": "no",
  "Did the study produce water table elevation, depth to water, piezometric surface, or potentiometric surface maps?|||No. There is no mention of creating water table elevation, depth to water, or piezometric/potentiometric surface maps in the sections provided. The study focused on water chemistry (conductivity, TDS, pH, etc.) rather than water-level mapping.": "no",
  "Does the study include water chemistry data (e.g. major ions, isotopes, pH, salinity, specific conductance)?|||Yes. The report provides measurements of salinity (as total dissolved solids), major ions (e.g., sulfate, chloride), specific conductance, and also discusses carbon isotopes\u2014indicating that water chemistry data such as major ions, isotopes, pH, salinity, and specific conductance are included in the study.": "yes",

The study reports measurements of total dissolved solids (TDS), major ions (e.g., sulfate, chloride, bromide), nitrate, and stable carbon isotopes, along with indicators like specific conductance and salinity.": "yes",
  "Does the study include water chemistry data (e.g. major ions, isotopes, pH, salinity, specific conductance)?|||Yes. The text indicates that 313 water samples were collected from wells (mostly irrigation wells), and it specifically references chloride concentrations and salinity issues in the aquifer. While it does not list every parameter measured, it makes clear that chemical analyses (e.g., chloride levels) and other water-quality data were part of the study.": "yes",
  "Does the study include water chemistry data (e.g. major ions, isotopes, pH, salinity, specific conductance)?|||Yes. The report specifically provides chloride concentrations and total dissolved solids (TDS) data (i.e. salinity). It does not explicitly list other major ions, pH, isotopes, or specific conductance, though it discusses increases in mineral content and saltwater encroachment\u2014indicating that salinity-related parameters (chloride, TDS) are the primary water chemistry data presented.": "yes",
  "Does the study include water chemistry data (e.g. major ions, isotopes, pH, salinity, specific conductance)?|||Yes. The text discusses measured total dissolved solids (TDS), major ions (e.g. sulfate, chloride, nitrate, and phosphate), carbon isotopes (\u00b9\u00b3C and \u00b9\u2074C), and specific conductance, indicating that water chemistry data (including isotopes and salinity indicators) were collected as part of the study.": "yes",
  "Does the study include water chemistry data (e.g. major ions, isotopes, pH, salinity, specific conductance)?|||Yes. The study presents data on major ions, pH, total dissolved solids (TDS), and specific conductance (conductivity). It also constructs Piper plots, Stiff diagrams, and Box-and-Whisker plots from these parameters. Although the text recommends future isotope work, no stable-isotope data are included in the current study.": "yes",
  "Does the study report specific hydrogeologic properties such as porosity, permeability, storage coefficients, specific storage, specific yield, hydraulic conductivity, and/or transmissivity?|||Yes. The text specifically mentions secondary (karstic) porosity and gives a hydraulic conductivity estimate exceeding 400 m/day (~4.6\u00d710\u207b\u00b3 m/s, or about 4,800 darcies). It does not provide explicit values for other hydrogeologic properties such as storage coefficients, specific yield, or transmissivity.": "yes",
  "Does the study report specific hydrogeologic properties such as porosity, permeability, storage coefficients, specific storage, specific yield, hydraulic conductivity, and/or transmissivity?|||They do report an approximate hydraulic conductivity (on the order of 400\u202fm/day, or ~4,800\u202fdarcies of permeability) inferred from tritium-based age estimates. The text also describes significant secondary (karstic) porosity in the San Andres aquifer but does not provide specific numeric values for storage coefficients, transmissivity, or other parameters.": "no",
  "Does the study report specific hydrogeologic properties such as porosity, permeability, storage coefficients, specific storage, specific yield, hydraulic conductivity, and/or transmissivity?|||They explicitly report transmissivity values in the deeper (144\u201328,000 m\u00b2/day) and shallow aquifer zones (150\u201313,600 m\u00b2/day), and they also note that secondary porosity is important but without giving a numerical porosity value. No specific data are given for other parameters such as permeability, storage coefficients, or hydraulic conductivity.": "no",
  "Does the study report specific hydrogeologic properties such as porosity, permeability, storage coefficients, specific storage, specific yield, hydraulic conductivity, and/or transmissivity?|||They do report transmissivity values (from Hantush, 1957) ranging from about 7,500 to 196,000 ft\u00b2/day and note that the aquifer has \u201cerratically developed, highly porous and transmissive zones.\u201d They also discuss porosity and permeability qualitatively but do not cite specific values for storage coefficients, specific storage, specific yield, or hydraulic conductivity.": "no",
  "Does the study report specific hydrogeologic properties such as porosity, permeability, storage coefficients, specific storage, specific yield, hydraulic conductivity, and/or transmissivity?|||They do mention secondary porosity qualitatively (e.g., \u201cvuggy and cavernous limestones\u201d) and cite hydraulic conductivity values of up to roughly 400 m/day (about 4,800 darcies) if the aquifer behaves as argued by Rabinowitz et al. (1977). However, they do not give specific measured values for permeability, transmissivity, storage coefficients, specific storage, or specific yield in the excerpted text.": "no",
  "Does the study report specific hydrogeologic properties such as porosity, permeability, storage coefficients, specific storage, specific yield, hydraulic conductivity, and/or transmissivity?|||No. The sections provided focus on water chemistry, geochemical facies, and related parameters (e.g., TDS, pH, and ion concentrations).
