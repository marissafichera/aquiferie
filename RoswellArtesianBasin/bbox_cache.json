  "From the references to the Guadalupe and Sacramento Mountains in western Eddy County and the general extent of the lower Pecos region into southeastern New Mexico, a reasonable approximation (in decimal degrees) is:\n\n\u2022 Western boundary near 106\u00b0W  \n\u2022 Eastern boundary near 103\u00b0W  \n\u2022 Southern boundary near 32\u00b0N  \n\u2022 Northern boundary near 34\u00b0N  \n\nSo, an approximate bounding box would be:  \n(32.0\u00b0N, 106.0\u00b0W) \u2013 (34.0\u00b0N, 106.0\u00b0W) \u2013 (34.0\u00b0N, 103.0\u00b0W) \u2013 (32.0\u00b0N, 103.0\u00b0W).\n\no3-mini Evaluation:\nCorrect?: No\n\nExplanation: The report does not provide explicit decimal degree coordinates or a clearly defined geographic bounding box. The original answer is an interpretation that assigns arbitrary limits (e.g., 32\u00b0N to 34\u00b0N and 106\u00b0W to 103\u00b0W) without direct support from the text. The report only discusses features (like the Guadalupe and Sacramento Mountains, the lower Pecos region, and locations within Eddy County) without listing precise boundaries.\n\nCorrected Answer (if needed): The report does not specify a bounding box in decimal degrees. Based on the text\u2019s descriptions, one might infer the study area covers parts of southeastern New Mexico (e.g., areas near the Guadalupe and Sacramento Mountains in western Eddy County), but any numerical bounding box (e.g., (32\u00b0N, 106\u00b0W) to (34\u00b0N, 103\u00b0W)) would be speculative rather than directly supported by the report.": [
