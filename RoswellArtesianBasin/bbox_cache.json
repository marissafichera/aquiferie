  "From the references to the Guadalupe and Sacramento Mountains in western Eddy County and the general extent of the lower Pecos region into southeastern New Mexico, a reasonable approximation (in decimal degrees) is:\n\n\u2022 Western boundary near 106\u00b0W  \n\u2022 Eastern boundary near 103\u00b0W  \n\u2022 Southern boundary near 32\u00b0N  \n\u2022 Northern boundary near 34\u00b0N  \n\nSo, an approximate bounding box would be:  \n(32.0\u00b0N, 106.0\u00b0W) \u2013 (34.0\u00b0N, 106.0\u00b0W) \u2013 (34.0\u00b0N, 103.0\u00b0W) \u2013 (32.0\u00b0N, 103.0\u00b0W).\n\no3-mini Evaluation:\nCorrect?: No\n\nExplanation: The report does not provide explicit decimal degree coordinates or a clearly defined geographic bounding box. The original answer is an interpretation that assigns arbitrary limits (e.g., 32\u00b0N to 34\u00b0N and 106\u00b0W to 103\u00b0W) without direct support from the text. The report only discusses features (like the Guadalupe and Sacramento Mountains, the lower Pecos region, and locations within Eddy County) without listing precise boundaries.\n\nCorrected Answer (if needed): The report does not specify a bounding box in decimal degrees. Based on the text\u2019s descriptions, one might infer the study area covers parts of southeastern New Mexico (e.g., areas near the Guadalupe and Sacramento Mountains in western Eddy County), but any numerical bounding box (e.g., (32\u00b0N, 106\u00b0W) to (34\u00b0N, 103\u00b0W)) would be speculative rather than directly supported by the report.": [

  "No exact bounding box is given in the text. However, the only explicit coordinates are for the Orchard Park monitoring well, at about 33.2569\u00b0N, \u2013104.4145\u00b0, located roughly 10\u202fkm southwest of Lea Lake. Lea Lake (in Bottomless Lakes State Park) lies about 33.31\u201333.32\u00b0N, \u2013104.34\u2013104.35\u00b0W. Including the park lands and the nearby wetland that connects eastward to the Pecos River, a reasonable approximate bounding box would be from about 33.20\u00b0N to 33.35\u00b0N, and \u2013104.45\u00b0W to \u2013104.30\u00b0W.\n\no3-mini Evaluation:\nCorrect?: Yes\n\nExplanation: The answer correctly notes that no exact bounding box is provided and then derives an approximate box using the explicit coordinates mentioned in the report\u2014specifically, the Orchard Park monitoring well (\u201clat 33\u00b015.417'N, long 104\u00b024.867'W\u201d) and the approximate location of Lea Lake (about 33.31\u201333.32\u00b0N, \u2013104.34\u2013104.35\u00b0W). The resulting estimated bounding box (33.20\u00b0N to 33.35\u00b0N and \u2013104.45\u00b0W to \u2013104.30\u00b0W) is a reasonable derivation based on the text.\n\nCorrected Answer (if needed): No correction is necessary.": [

  "The text does not provide explicit coordinates. However, the Roswell Basin in southeastern New Mexico generally lies between roughly 33\u00b0N and 34.5\u00b0N latitude and 105\u00b0W to about 104\u00b0W longitude. A reasonable inferred bounding box (in decimal degrees) would be approximately:\n\n\u2022 North\u2013South: 33.0 to 34.5\u00b0 N  \n\u2022 West\u2013East: 105.0 to 104.0\u00b0 W  \n\no3-mini Evaluation:\nCorrect?: No  \nExplanation: The report text does not provide explicit geographic bounding box coordinates, and the answer\u2019s coordinates are simply an inference. There are no quotes or sections in the report that support the provided latitude and longitude ranges.  \nCorrected Answer (if needed): The report does not include explicit decimal degree coordinates for the study area\u2019s bounding box. Therefore, any bounding box inferred (e.g., 33.0 to 34.5\u00b0 N, 105.0 to 104.0\u00b0 W) is speculative and not directly supported by the report text.": [

  "From the descriptions (extending several kilometers on either side of the Pecos River from near the Texas border northward to Santa Rosa), a reasonable inferred bounding box is roughly:  \n\u2022 Latitude: 31.7\u00b0N (near the Texas\u2013New Mexico border) to 34.9\u00b0N (near Santa Rosa)  \n\u2022 Longitude: \u2212105.0\u00b0 (farther west) to \u2212103.0\u00b0 (farther east)  \n\nThe text does not give precise coordinates, so this is an approximate best fit for the \u201clower Pecos region\u201d described.\n\no3-mini Evaluation:\nCorrect?: No\n\nExplanation: The answer provides an inferred box (latitudes 31.7\u00b0N\u201334.9\u00b0N and longitudes \u2212105.0 to \u2212103.0) that isn\u2019t directly supported by the report. The report only describes the regional extent in narrative terms (e.g., \u201ceast side of the Pecos River valley,\u201d \u201capproximately 20 km north of Carlsbad, NM,\u201d \u201cfrom Texas to as far north as Santa Rosa\u201d) without giving specific decimal degree coordinates.\n\nCorrected Answer (if needed): The report does not furnish an explicit geographic bounding box. Based on the description\u2014Coffee Cave is on the east side of the Pecos River valley about 20 km north of Carlsbad, New Mexico, and the evaporite karst extends \u201cfrom Texas to as far north as Santa Rosa in east\u2010central New Mexico\u201d\u2014any coordinate box would be an approximation. For example, one might tentatively estimate a bounding box roughly from about 31.5\u00b0\u201335.0\u00b0N in latitude and about \u2212105.5\u00b0 to \u2212103.0\u00b0W in longitude, but this is speculative and not directly provided by the report.": [

  "No precise latitude/longitude bounds are stated in the excerpts.

The report does not provide any definite latitude/longitude values, so the presented bounding box (32.2\u00b0\u202fN to 34.0\u00b0\u202fN and 105.0\u00b0\u202fW to 104.2\u00b0\u202fW) appears to be an arbitrary estimate without direct textual support.\n\nCorrected Answer (if needed): The report does not state a precise geographic bounding box in latitude/longitude. Based solely on the place\u2010names mentioned\u2014for example, Roswell (roughly 33.4\u00b0\u202fN), Hope (about 32.8\u00b0\u202fN), Seven Rivers Hills (around 32.3\u00b0\u202fN), and a general longitude range near 105\u00b0\u202fW\u2014it is possible to infer an approximate envelope.
