The text presents differing views on whether a digital product specifically defining aquifer extent was published. While several references note the use of a digital elevation model (DEM) and the creation of various water table and geologic maps (suggesting digital mapping work was conducted), the text does not explicitly confirm that these efforts resulted in a standalone digital product dedicated solely to defining the aquifer extent. Instead, it emphasizes that the study included multiple mapped outputs (such as water chemistry, well locations, and a regional water table map), all of which could indirectly inform aquifer boundaries without definitively stating that there was a published digital product focused exclusively on those boundaries.
