The provided text repeatedly indicates that the aquifer studies discussed do not include water quality data. Instead, they focus on hydrogeologic characteristics, geological and structural mapping, managed aquifer recharge suitability, stratigraphy, geophysical surveys, and fault-zone analyses. Additionally, some text references errors in extracting data from the PDF, noting that no water quality information could be confirmed. Therefore, based on the available information, it appears that water quality is not a primary focus of these studies.
