The text contains mostly repeated statements indicating that the base of the Santa Fe Group aquifer was not explicitly defined in the study or could not be confirmed from the provided excerpts. These statements emphasize that the focus was on vertical hydraulic conductivities, infiltration rates, and groundwater-level data rather than on establishing the aquifer’s physical boundaries or base. However, there is one contradictory mention stating that the study did define the aquifer’s base using borehole data, magnetotelluric soundings, and seismic-reflection data. Overall, the excerpts largely do not confirm that the aquifer’s base was defined, and further report details would be needed to clarify this point.
