The text discusses whether various studies and reports mention publishing a digital product defining the aquifer extent. While several sources describe detailed geological mapping, hydrogeologic frameworks, or digitized data (such as 3D geophysical models and water-level maps), they do not explicitly confirm the publication of a dedicated digital product defining the aquiferâ€™s extent. There are references suggesting that digital or mapped products related to aquifer thickness, structural elevation, and groundwater levels exist (e.g., in data repositories or on CD-ROMs), but it cannot be conclusively determined from the provided information whether a formal digital product defining the entire aquifer extent was published.
