  "The report does not give exact bounding\u2010box coordinates. However, based on the described coverage (parts of the Placitas, Hagan, Golden, Sandia Crest, Sandia Park, San Pedro, Tijeras, Sedillo, and Edgewood 7.5\u2032 quadrangles) and an overall area of about 400 square miles, a reasonable approximation is:\n\n\u2022 Western boundary near 106.50\u00b0W  \n\u2022 Eastern boundary near 106.20\u00b0W  \n\u2022 Southern boundary near 35.00\u00b0N  \n\u2022 Northern boundary near 35.35\u00b0N  \n\nThis corresponds to roughly 35.0\u00b0\u201335.35\u00b0N latitude and 106.5\u00b0\u2013106.2\u00b0W longitude.\n\no3-mini Evaluation:\nCorrect?: No  \nExplanation: The report does not state precise decimal degree coordinates for the study area. While the answer attempts an approximation based on the mentioned USGS quadrangles and area size, these coordinates are not directly supported by specific information or quotes in the report.  \nCorrected Answer (if needed): The report does not provide an exact bounding box in decimal degrees. It only indicates that the study area covers about 400 square miles in parts of Bernalillo, Sandoval, Santa Fe, and Torrance Counties, including areas on the eastern slopes of the Sandia, Manzanita, and northern Manzano Mountains and several named USGS quadrangles.

  "No explicit latitudes and longitudes are given in the text. However, based on the described location (in central New Mexico, roughly 100\u202fkm southeast of Albuquerque, bounded by the Manzano Mountains to the west, Pedernal Hills to the east, and Chupadera Mesa to the south), a reasonable approximation for the Estancia Basin study area is from about 34.5\u00b0\u202fN to 35.2\u00b0\u202fN and 106.8\u00b0\u202fW to 105.7\u00b0\u202fW.\n\no3-mini Evaluation:\nCorrect?: No\n\nExplanation: The report does not provide explicit latitude or longitude coordinates.
