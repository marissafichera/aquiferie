- These tools and data collectively help in visualizing and defining the spatial extent of the aquifer in two dimensions.","- The study does not explicitly mention defining the base of the aquifer.
- However, it does mention the use of subsurface geologic data from well records and lithologic logs, which typically include information that could help infer the base of an aquifer, such as the depth at which water-bearing formations are no longer present.
- Additionally, the study involved geologic mapping and identification of subsurface geologic units from well logs, which are essential for understanding the vertical extent of aquifer systems.
- Therefore, it can be inferred that the study likely utilized well records, lithologic logs, and geologic mapping to understand or define the base of the aquifer, although this specific detail is not directly stated.","- The provided text does not explicitly mention the publication of a digital product that defined the aquifer extent.
- However, the report includes various maps and geologic data (e.g., Figure 6–Geologic map of the study area, Figure 22–Water level elevation contour maps), which suggest that digital or mapped products were likely created as part of the study's outputs.
