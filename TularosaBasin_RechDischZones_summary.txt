The text describes how various studies and datasets have been used to identify recharge and discharge zones in the Tularosa Basin. Key points include:

• Major sources of recharge:  
  – Streams draining from the Sacramento Mountains (e.g., Nogal Creek, Three Rivers, Rio Tularosa, La Luz Creek), which are often fed by springs.  
  – Seasonal precipitation (especially during monsoon months, July–September) that infiltrates through permeable geologic formations (such as the Carrizozo lava flows or alluvial fan deposits).

• Data used to define recharge and discharge zones:  
  – Historical hydrogeologic research (e.g., Meinzer and Hare, McLean) and more recent studies (Embid and Finch).  
  – Groundwater elevation and water‐table maps illustrating flow patterns.  
  – Groundwater salinity and quality data (freshwater on basin margins, more saline water in central areas).  
  – Observations of groundwater level changes and water chemistry following precipitation events.

• Implied discharge areas:  
  – Springs with low discharge rates (around 6 gallons per minute).  
  – Lowland areas in the center of the basin (such as Alkali Flat and near Lake Lucero), where evaporation and higher salinity suggest groundwater flow terminates.

• Study limitations:  
  – While the data suggest where recharge and discharge are most likely occurring, some portions of the text do not explicitly delineate these zones, noting instead local indicators (e.g., perched aquifers at high elevations) and general basin‐wide patterns of inflow and outflow.
