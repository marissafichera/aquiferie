The study’s data originates from both existing, previously published sources and newly collected information. Historical water chemistry and groundwater data were obtained from agencies such as the New Mexico Bureau of Geology and Mineral Resources (NMBGMR), the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), and the New Mexico Environment Department (NMED), as well as from older publications (e.g., Meinzer and Hare 1915, McLean 1970). Meanwhile, new data were gathered between 2009 and 2012 by NMBGMR, contractors, and students, including field measurements (e.g., depth-to-water), geochemical analyses, and environmental tracer sampling. The study additionally utilized historical water-level information, water table maps, and digital elevation models. Overall, data compilation spanned a variety of sources—integrating legacy datasets with newly generated field observations—to provide a comprehensive understanding of the region’s groundwater and geologic conditions.
