The text indicates that the report does not explicitly define the base of the aquifer or detail the data used for such a definition. Instead, it focuses on groundwater salinity, water quality, and the geological context of the Tularosa Basin. While it suggests that more permeable sand units may extend beneath thick, saline-saturated lacustrine deposits, there is no clear statement on the aquifer’s base or how it might have been determined. Although the study relies on subsurface geologic data from well records and lithologic logs—which could help infer the base—no explicit explanation is provided on how (or if) these data were used to define it. Given the information provided, it is not possible to confirm whether the study formally identified or characterized the aquifer’s base.
