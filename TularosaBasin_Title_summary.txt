These references all concern hydrologic and hydrogeologic studies in the Tularosa Basin region of New Mexico. They include assessments of brackish water, investigations of hydrology at White Sands National Monument, and creation of a regional water table map. Although one title is not explicitly stated, it can be inferred from context that it addresses a broader hydrogeologic investigation of the Western Sacramento Mountains and Northeastern Tularosa Basin.
