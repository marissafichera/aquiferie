The cited studies determined key hydrogeologic properties—horizontal saturated hydraulic conductivity (Khoriz), specific capacity, storage coefficient, specific yield, and vertical hydraulic conductivity (Kvert)—primarily through pump tests and infiltration data from consultant reports and other literature. In some cases, infiltration rates were measured by the falling head method. The compiled data were statistically analyzed (with box-and-whisker plots) and median values were identified as representative for each hydrostratigraphic unit.
