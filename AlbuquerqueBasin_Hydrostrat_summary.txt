The text presents multiple, contradictory statements about whether a particular study defined the hydrostratigraphy of the Santa Fe Group aquifer system. Some statements assert that the study did indeed define the hydrostratigraphyâ€”citing geologic mapping, subsurface work by Connell (2008b) and Connell et al. (1998), and analysis of wireline logs for 17 wells to identify permeable zones. Other statements indicate uncertainty or claim that the hydrostratigraphy was not explicitly defined, noting that the text focuses on groundwater-level changes, water management, or fault characterization rather than stratigraphic details. Several passages also mention that due to errors in text extraction, it is unclear whether the study contained a definitive hydrostratigraphic interpretation. Consequently, the information provided is inconsistent and leaves open the question of whether the study actually included a detailed hydrostratigraphic framework for the aquifer system.
