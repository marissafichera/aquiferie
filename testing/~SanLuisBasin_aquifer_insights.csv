Aquifer(s) name,"The report does not explicitly name a specific aquifer. However, it focuses on the springs of the Rio Grande Gorge in Taos County, New Mexico, which are part of the hydrogeologic system that includes aquifers associated with the Rio Grande rift and the Taos Plateau.","The study does not mention a specific name for the aquifer(s) focused on, but it discusses the basin-fill sediments in the Questa area, particularly the Santa Fe Group, Chamita Formation, and Lama Formation, as potential aquifers."
Aquifer boundary definition,"The study did not explicitly define the aquifer boundaries in 2D or 3D. It primarily focused on locating, inventorying, and sampling springs, as well as conducting preliminary geochemical analyses to evaluate the hydrogeologic connections between groundwater and the Rio Grande.",The study defined the aquifer boundaries in 3D by constructing three-dimensional geologic cross sections of the Questa area.
Data used to define aquifer boundary,"The report does not explicitly detail the data used to define the aquifer boundaries. However, it mentions the study area lies within the southern San Luis Basin, part of the Rio Grande rift, and references regional geology, including volcanic rocks, sedimentary deposits, and fault systems, which are likely considered in understanding the aquifer boundaries. The report also discusses the hydrogeologic setting, including recharge and discharge areas, which would contribute to defining aquifer boundaries.","The aquifer boundaries in the Questa area were defined using a combination of geologic and geophysical data. This included local and regional geologic maps, interpretations from borehole geology and borehole geophysics, and three geophysical data sets: high-resolution aeromagnetic surveys, ground-magnetic surveys, and gravity modeling. Additionally, depth-to-water measurements and spring locations collected by the NMBG, as well as historic depth-to-water data from various sources, were used to inform the hydrogeologic understanding of the area."
Digital product of aquifer boundary,The report does not specify the publication of a digital product that defines the aquifer boundaries. It primarily focuses on the inventory and preliminary geochemical analysis of springs in the Rio Grande Gorge area.,"No, the study did not publish a digital product that defined the aquifer boundaries. It focused on geologic and geophysical investigations, including geologic cross sections and preliminary hydrogeology, but did not specifically define aquifer boundaries in a digital format."
Hydrostratigraphy,"No, the study did not define the hydrostratigraphy of the subsurface. It focused on locating, inventorying, describing, and sampling the springs in the Rio Grande Gorge to understand the hydrogeologic connections between groundwater and the Rio Grande. While it presented some geochemical data and preliminary findings, a detailed evaluation of the sources, groundwater flow paths, and detailed geologic settings of the springs was beyond the scope of this project and planned as a future study.","The study provided preliminary insights into the hydrostratigraphy of the subsurface in the Questa area by developing detailed geologic cross sections and characterizing the shallow three-dimensional geology and hydrogeology to a depth of approximately 5,000 feet. However, it did not definitively define the hydrostratigraphy, as the thicknesses and lateral extents of some units, such as clay layers, were only estimated due to limited well control."
Data used to define hydrostratigraphy,"The hydrostratigraphy in the report was primarily defined using geologic and hydrologic data, including the regional geology of the San Luis Basin and Taos Plateau, the presence and characteristics of volcanic rocks such as the Servilleta Formation basalts, and the structural features like faults. The report also utilized data from spring inventories, geochemical analyses, and isotopic studies to understand the hydrogeologic connections between groundwater and the Rio Grande. Additionally, previous studies and reports on the area's geology and hydrology were referenced to support the hydrostratigraphic framework.","The hydrostratigraphy in the Questa area was defined using several data sources:

1. **Geologic Maps**: Local and regional geologic maps were used to establish geologic units.

2. **Boreholes**: Geologic and geophysical data from boreholes, including lithologic cutting analyses and borehole geophysics, were used to define subsurface stratigraphy.

3. **Geophysical Data**: Interpretations from high-resolution aeromagnetic surveys, ground-magnetic surveys, and gravity modeling provided constraints on subsurface geology.

4. **Water-Well Records**: Existing subsurface geologic data from water-well records and lithologic logs contributed to the understanding of hydrostratigraphy.

Structural controls,"No, the study did not define subsurface structural controls on groundwater flow. It focused on locating, inventorying, describing, and sampling springs in the Rio Grande Gorge. While it provided preliminary geochemical data and mapped the distribution of springs, it did not evaluate the sources, groundwater flow paths, or detailed geologic settings, which are planned for future studies.","Yes, the study defined subsurface structural controls on groundwater flow. It identified faults and volcanic structures that influence groundwater movement, noting that these features can either enhance or restrict flow depending on their characteristics. The study emphasized the complexity of buried faults and their potential impact on groundwater flow in the Questa area."
Data used to define structural controls,"The structural controls in the Rio Grande Gorge were defined using information on fault systems and their intersections with the gorge. Specifically, the report mentions the Red River fault system and the Dunn fault as significant structural controls. These faults are characterized by their orientations, movements, and the presence of brittle fracture zones, which enhance permeability and influence groundwater flow to the springs. The geologic mapping and descriptions of these faults, as well as their hydrologic significance, were used to define the structural controls.","The structural controls were defined using the following data sources:

1. Mapped faults from the geologic map.
2. Inferred faults from magnetic and gravity surveys.
3. A conceptual model of the geometry and kinematics of the northern Rio Grande rift."

Recharge and discharge zones,"Yes, the study identified recharge and discharge zones for the springs in the Rio Grande Gorge. Recharge occurs primarily from the Sangre de Cristo Mountains, with water moving westward through alluvial fan sediments and basalt flows before discharging into the Rio Grande Gorge through springs. Discharge zones are located along the river channel and canyon walls, where springs emerge, often associated with geologic features like faults or volcanic formations.","The study did not explicitly define recharge and discharge zones, but it provided some insights into potential recharge areas. The report mentioned that the shallow aquifer in the area is likely recharged by infiltration along Cabresto Creek and the acequia systems and fields east of the well. Additionally, the overall flow of the shallow groundwater system is described as westerly, from the Sangre de Cristo Mountains toward the Rio Grande gorge and the Red River, suggesting potential discharge zones in those areas."
Data used to define recharge and discharge zones,"The data used to define recharge and discharge zones in the study included general water chemistry, stable isotope ratios of hydrogen and oxygen, and age-dating analyses such as tritium, chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), and carbon-14. These parameters help identify the origin, flow paths, and age of groundwater, which are critical for understanding recharge and discharge zones. The spatial distribution of these geochemical parameters, along with geological features like faults and volcanic structures, helped delineate areas where groundwater is recharged and where it discharges into the Rio Grande gorge.","The data used to define recharge and discharge zones included water-level measurements and spring locations collected by the NMBG in 2013 and 2014, as well as historic depth-to-water data from various published and unpublished sources. Additionally, hydrologic information such as the locations of spring zones, streams, acequias, water levels in wells, and variations in field parameters like groundwater temperature were considered. The preliminary water table map and the understanding of local geology, including permeability contrasts and topography, also contributed to identifying these zones."
