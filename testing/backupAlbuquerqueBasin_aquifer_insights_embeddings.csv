"The title of the study is ""Mapping Suitability for Managed Aquifer Recharge in the Albuquerque Basin.""",The aquifer focused on in the study is the axial facies of the Sierra Ladrones Formation (QTsa).,"Yes, the study defined the aquifer extent in 2D, as evidenced by the creation of contour maps and the interpolation of the potentiometric surface, which are typically two-dimensional representations of subsurface features.","The provided text does not explicitly mention defining the base of the aquifer. The focus is primarily on vertical hydraulic conductivities, infiltration rates, and the potentiometric surface, rather than on defining the aquifer's base. Therefore, based on the available information, it cannot be confirmed that the study defined the base of the aquifer.","The provided references do not explicitly mention the publication of a digital product that defines the aquifer extent. However, several studies and reports focus on mapping, hydrogeologic frameworks, and geophysical models, which could potentially include digital or mapped products related to aquifer extents, but this is not explicitly stated.","Yes, the study defined the hydrostratigraphy of the aquifer. The data used to define the hydrostratigraphy included geologic mapping and subsurface work by Connell (2008b) and Connell et al. (1998), analysis of wireline logs for 17 wells, and lithologic picks detailed in Connell (2008b). These sources provided information on lithologic units, paleodepositional environments, and provenances necessary for identifying and characterizing the hydrostratigraphic units.","Yes, the study defined subsurface structural controls on groundwater flow. The data used to define these structural controls included manual contouring of hydrostratigraphic units and fault planes in ArcMap, using lithologic units derived from the Wellpoint feature class in the GIS files of Connell (2008b), as well as structural contour maps of the Sierra Ladrones Formation. These methods helped in understanding the subsurface geology which influences groundwater flow patterns.","Yes, the study defined recharge zones. The data used to define these zones included soil vertical hydraulic conductivity, soil drainage class, surface slope, depth to groundwater, percolation times, clay content, and other deep-geology criteria such as transmissivity and potentiometric-surface gradient. These criteria were scored, weighted, and mapped to assess the suitability of different areas for shallow-based recharge. Specific areas identified as suitable for recharge included the Bear Canyon Arroyo, areas along Tijeras Arroyo, and the vicinity of the San Juan-Chama Drinking Water Treatment Plant. The study does not explicitly mention discharge zones.","The study did not explicitly quantify recharge and discharge rates or amounts. Instead, it focused on assessing hydraulic properties such as hydraulic conductivity and infiltration rates of various hydrostratigraphic units, using data from pump tests and infiltration studies. These properties are crucial for understanding the potential for managed aquifer recharge but do not directly measure recharge and discharge rates or amounts.","The study produced a depth-to-groundwater map, as indicated by the process of subtracting the elevation of the potentiometric surface from the land-surface elevation at grid cells.","The water table elevation map or depth to water map was created using several sources of data:

1. 2012 potentiometric surface data published by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) for the area west of Juan Tabo Boulevard.
2. Groundwater-level data from the USGS and the New Mexico Office of the State Engineer-Water Rights Reporting System (WRRS) for the area east of Juan Tabo Boulevard. This data was collected mainly from non-pumping wells during the years 2011–2013, with some additional data spanning 2010–2016.
3. Interpolation of the potentiometric surface was performed using a regularized spline function in ArcGIS, which was then contoured at 20-ft intervals to match the 2012 USGS dataset.
4. Manual adjustments to contours were made based on specific geologic information and to accommodate coverage constraints, such as the assumption of steep contours continuing northward along the range-front fault system near Sandia Pueblo, and adjustments near Domingo Baca Canyon and Tijeras Arroyo.

These combined datasets and methods were used to create a comprehensive map of the potentiometric surface, which was then used to calculate the depth to groundwater by subtracting the elevation of the potentiometric surface from the land-surface elevation at grid cells.","Water levels for the study were compiled from both other sources and collected data. The potentiometric surface data primarily came from the 2012 USGS dataset and additional groundwater-level data obtained from the USGS and the New Mexico Office of the State Engineer-Water Rights Reporting System (WRRS), covering years 2010–2016.","The provided sections of the aquifer report do not explicitly mention the inclusion of water quality data.

These sources provide direct or related insights into water quality within the specified regions and contexts.","The study report specifically mentions the analysis of hydraulic conductivity for various hydrostratigraphic units. However, it does not explicitly mention other hydrogeologic properties such as porosity, permeability (beyond hydraulic conductivity), storage coefficients, specific storage, specific yield, or transmissivity in the provided text.","The specific hydrogeologic properties such as horizontal saturated hydraulic conductivity (Khoriz), specific capacity, storage coefficient, specific yield, and vertical hydraulic conductivity (Kvert) were determined through pump tests and infiltration data compiled from consultant reports and other literature sources. Additionally, infiltration rates were measured using the falling head method in some studies.","The provided text does not explicitly list future work recommendations for the study on the suitability for managed aquifer recharge (MAR) in the Albuquerque Basin. However, based on the detailed analysis and findings presented, the following future work recommendations can be inferred:

1. Further Validation of MAR Suitability Maps: Conduct additional field studies and pump tests to validate the MAR suitability maps created through weighted overlay analyses. This could help refine the criteria and improve the accuracy of the suitability ratings.

2. Monitoring and Evaluation of Implemented MAR Sites: Establish monitoring protocols at sites selected for MAR to assess the effectiveness of recharge methods and the accuracy of predictive models.

8. Exploration of New Technologies: Investigate new technologies and methods for enhancing the efficiency and sustainability of MAR practices, such as advanced filtration techniques or renewable energy sources for pumping and treatment processes.

9. Assessment of Climate Change Impacts: Study the potential impacts of climate change on MAR suitability, particularly how altered precipitation patterns and increased temperatures might affect recharge rates and water demand.

10. Soil Hydrocompaction Mitigation Strategies: Develop and test strategies to mitigate soil hydrocompaction in areas identified as susceptible, ensuring the long-term viability of shallow-based MAR methods.

3. Expand Geographic Scope: Consider expanding the study area to include regions beyond the current boundaries, especially areas that might benefit from MAR but were not included in the initial study.

4. Assess Environmental and Social Impacts: Conduct studies to understand the potential environmental and social impacts of implementing MAR in the identified suitable areas. This includes assessing the impact on local ecosystems, water quality, and community acceptance.

5. Develop Management Strategies for Exclusion Zones: Investigate alternative water management strategies for areas designated as exclusion zones where MAR is not suitable. This could involve looking at other forms of water conservation or localized treatment and reuse options.

6. Long-term Impact Studies: Initiate long-term studies to observe the impacts of MAR on the groundwater system, particularly changes in groundwater levels, quality, and the potential for land subsidence or hydrocompaction in areas susceptible to these issues.

7. Technological Improvements and Innovations: Explore and integrate new technologies and methodologies for improving the efficiency and effectiveness of MAR practices. This could include advanced remote sensing technologies, improved infiltration techniques, or innovative water treatment methods prior to recharge.

8. Policy and Regulatory Framework Development: Work with local and regional authorities to develop policies and regulatory frameworks that support the sustainable implementation of MAR, ensuring that it aligns with broader water resource management goals and protects the rights and resources of local communities.

It focused on characterizing fault zones and their impact on groundwater flow within the Albuquerque Basin, rather than defining the spatial extent of the aquifer in two dimensions.","The study did not explicitly define the base of the aquifer. The sections provided focus primarily on the structural and cementation properties of fault zones within the Albuquerque Basin and their implications for groundwater flow, rather than detailing the vertical extent or base of the aquifer system.","Yes, the study published a digital product that defined the aquifer extent.

However, it systematically characterized physical, structural, and cementation properties of many fault zones in the Albuquerque aquifer basins to infer hydrologic properties of the faults. This characterization likely involved analyzing the distribution and geometry of ground-water flow paths, fault zone cementation, and the permeability of different lithologies and fault structures. The data used for these inferences included observations of fault cores, damage zones, and cementation patterns, as well as statistical evaluations of fault zone measurements related to dominant host lithology and sediment grain size.","Yes, the study defined subsurface structural controls on groundwater flow. The data used to define these structural controls included observations and measurements of fault zone widths, lithologic variations, cementation, and the presence of clay or gouge in fault cores. Additionally, the study utilized statistical evaluations of fault zone properties, interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) images, and evidence of localized fluid flow and cementation patterns within fault zones. These combined data sources helped infer the hydrologic properties of the faults and their impact on groundwater flow in the Albuquerque aquifer basins.","The study did not explicitly define recharge and discharge zones. Instead, it focused on characterizing the structural, physical, and cementation properties of fault zones in the Albuquerque Basin and their implications for groundwater flow. The study inferred ancient groundwater flow paths based on patterns of fault zone cementation, but specific recharge and discharge zones were not delineated.","No, the study did not quantify recharge and discharge rates or amounts. The focus of the study was on characterizing structural properties and cementation patterns of fault zones and their implications for groundwater flow, rather than directly measuring or quantifying groundwater recharge and discharge rates.","The study did not explicitly produce a water table elevation map or a depth to water map. It focused on characterizing the structural, physical, and cementation properties of fault zones in the Albuquerque Basin, particularly in relation to their impact on groundwater flow.","The data used to create the water table elevation map or depth to water map in the middle Rio Grande Basin was derived from predevelopment water-level measurements.

It focuses on structural properties and cementation patterns of fault zones and their implications for ground-water flow, not on water quality.","The data for the study was both collected and compiled from other sources. Field observations and measurements were conducted during a field campaign in the Santo Domingo and northern Albuquerque Basins, as indicated by the detailed characterization of fault zones at 176 sites. Additionally, the study also utilized previously published and unpublished data, such as isostatic residual gravity data and geophysical lineaments from various sources.","The water quality data sources in the provided aquifer report sections are not explicitly mentioned. However, reports and studies such as those by Bexfield, L.M., and Anderholm, S.K.

These studies typically include analyses of groundwater characteristics, which would encompass water quality parameters.","The study report does not explicitly mention specific hydrogeologic properties such as porosity, storage coefficients, specific storage, specific yield, or hydraulic conductivity. However, it does discuss permeability and transmissivity in the context of fault zones, particularly focusing on how fault cores and cementation affect these properties. The report emphasizes the impact of fault zone characteristics on fluid flow and permeability, rather than providing specific numerical values or detailed assessments of other hydrogeologic properties.",N/A,"The section does not explicitly list future work recommendations. However, based on the analysis and findings discussed, the following future work recommendations can be inferred:

1. Further Investigation of Cemented Faults: The study mentions that some cemented faults may be critically stressed and undergoing fracturing, which affects their ability to act as groundwater seals. Future studies could focus on evaluating the conditions of these faults to better understand their current and future hydrologic properties.

2. Detailed Analysis of Fault Zone Permeability: Given the importance of fault zone permeability in controlling groundwater flow, further detailed studies could be conducted to map out permeability variations within fault zones more precisely, especially in relation to the presence of cemented and refractured zones.

3. Monitoring and Modeling of Groundwater Flow: The study suggests that fault zones influence regional groundwater flow patterns. Future work could involve the development and application of more sophisticated numerical models to predict groundwater flow and the impact of fault zones on this flow, particularly in response to different stress states and tectonic activities.

4. Longitudinal Studies on Fault Zone Evolution: Since the study discusses the episodic refracturing of cement seals, longitudinal studies could be conducted to observe and document the evolution of fault zones over time, particularly in response to tectonic stresses and fluid pressures.

5. Cross-disciplinary Studies: Integrating geological studies with remote sensing (like InSAR) could enhance understanding of subsurface dynamics and the impact of faults on surface and subsurface hydrology.

6. Hydraulic Discontinuities and Gradient Studies: The study mentions hydraulic discontinuities and perturbed hydraulic gradients near cemented faults. Future research could focus on detailed hydraulic studies to understand the impact of these discontinuities on groundwater flow and management.

These recommendations aim to deepen the understanding of fault zone hydrology and improve the predictability and management of groundwater resources in faulted regions.",https://geoinfo.nmt.edu/publications/openfile/downloads/600-699/632/OFR_632.pdf
