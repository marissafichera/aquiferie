The text emphasizes that the study did not explicitly measure or quantify groundwater recharge and discharge rates. Instead, it focused on evaluating hydraulic properties—such as hydraulic conductivity and infiltration rates—using pump tests and infiltration studies. These findings are important for understanding managed aquifer recharge but do not provide direct measurements of recharge or discharge. The text also notes that errors in extracting information from the PDF report mean it is unclear whether any sections might address recharge or discharge rates more directly. Overall, the documents presently available concentrate on groundwater-level measurements, geological and structural assessments, and modeling efforts, rather than quantifying recharge or discharge.
