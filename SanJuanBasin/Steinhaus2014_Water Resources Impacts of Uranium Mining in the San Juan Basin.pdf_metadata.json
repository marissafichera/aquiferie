This was achieved by modeling a conceptual mine that is based on the physical character- istics present near the proposed Roca Honda Mine near Grants, New Mexico. An analysis of the uncertainty of the physical, situational, and model parameters and their associated sensitivities was conducted so that an understanding of potential groundwater withdrawals for uranium mining could be gathered. Uranium mining in the San Juan Basin, New Mexico, has ranged from being active between the years of 1950 and 1980, to currently non-existent due to volatility in the price of uranium. Previous mining in the area has caused detrimental e\u21b5ects to water resources in the area and future mining activity in the area could have a similar e\u21b5ect. Although it is well known that mining has and will a\u21b5ect water resources in the San Juan Basin, there is little knowledge on this subject available. The key \ufb01ndings through vi the analysis and understanding of the uncertainty and sensitivity of these aquifer properties were the probability and the range of the volumes and \ufb02ow rates that would be extracted for the conceptual mine. This analysis allows for better decisions and research to be made about future mining activity. vii Contents List of Figures x List of Tables xii 1 Introduction 1 1.1 Current State of Knowledge . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 4 1.2 Geology, Hydrology and Resources of The San Juan Basin (Site De- scription) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 5 1.3 History of Mining in the Grants district of the San Juan Basin . . . . 10 2 Research Methods 13 2.1 Conceptual Model Framework . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 13 2.2 Groundwater Calculations . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 15 2.2.1 Model Parameters . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 18 2.2.2 Uncertainty Analysis . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 20 2.2.3 Sensitivity Analysis Methods . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 23 viii Contents 3 Results 24 3.1 Veri\ufb01cation of Model . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 24 3.2 Sensitivity Analysis Results . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 27 3.3 Uncertainty Analysis Results . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 28 4 Discussion 34 5 Conclusion 37 A MATLAB code used for uncertainty analysis 42 B MATLAB code used for sensitivity analysis 48 ix List of Figures 1.1 Energy Resource Regions in the San Juan Basin [1] . . . . . . . . . 4 1.2 General Geologic Structure of the San Juan Basin including all major layers (Stone, 1983) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 6 1.3 Structural Elements of the San Juan Basin and Adjacent Areas (Kern- odle, 1996) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 7 1.4 Roca Honda Mine Permit Area (U.S. Forest Service, 2013) . . . . . 8 2.1 Diagram of Conceptual Uranium Mine Dewatering Well . . . . . . . 14 3.1 Time dependence Parameter Sensitivity . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 28 3.2 Distribution of Scenario 1 ."

First, model a conceptual mine based on the physical characteristics present at the proposed Roca Honda Mine in the Grants Mineral Belt, Ambrosia Lake District, by applying the Theis equation. The proposed mine is located within portions of Sections 9, 10, and 16, Township 13 North, Range 8 West, New Mexico Principal Meridian (\ufb01gure 1.4). These sections are located in McKinley County, New Mexico, approximately 3 miles northwest of San Mateo and 22 miles northeast of Grants, New Mexico [2]. The Theis equation allows for an aquifer to be simulated so that calculations about the aquifer and well drawdown can be conducted. Second, quantify the sensitivity of the model parameters within the area so that future work can be focused towards the most sensitive parameters and that more accurate quanti\ufb01cation of future water resource impacts can be calculated. Third, explore the uncertainty that is involved in modeling the proposed Roca Honda Mine site and provide quanti\ufb01ed results of groundwater extraction within the ten to 1 Chapter 1. Introduction ninety percent probabilities of a cumulative distribution so that better decisions can be made concerning the existing water resource. There have been previous attempts at quantifying impacts of uranium mining in the San Juan Basin [1], but there is a noted high degree of uncertainty that is involved with these calculations. The general uncertainty involved with this research is both epistemic and aleatory as there is both random variability as well as a lack of knowledge and understanding [3]. Uncertainty will be discussed in detail later on in this document. Calculations about potential water resource impacts have been made at the Roca Honda Mine to ful\ufb01ll National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) requirements by Roca Honda Resources Inc. in conjunction with the United States Forest Service [2]. To study the groundwater impacts of uranium mining, a model was constructed that simulates how much water a conceptual ura- nium mine will withdraw from the underlying geologic layer that contains uranium. The model will be used to estimate the amount of water that must be removed from underlying aquifers to support mining. The calculations of groundwater impacts in this study were done using the Theis equation [4]. The Theis equation relates a discharge, aquifer drawdown, and the physical properties of the aquifer that a\u21b5ect \ufb02ow in a transient groundwater system. It is used in this research to calculate the \ufb02ow out of a dewatering well for a conven- tional mine to operate in the San Juan Basin. This equation was used because it is a simple approximation and can be rapidly applied to the situation where as a more complex approach would be much more di\ufb03cult to manipulate. It can also be noted that the Theis equation is applied very often to approximate ground water \ufb02ows in real situations and is a proven method of approximation [5\u20137]. The San Juan Basin of New Mexico has yielded the largest amount of uranium ore mined in the United States and accounts for over 51 percent of the total uranium mined in the United States since the 1940s [8]. Currently, Wyoming is the largest 2 Chapter 1.

Currently, Wyoming is the largest 2 Chapter 1. Introduction producer of uranium in the United States [9], but historically the San Juan Basin generated more than 154 million kilograms (kg) of uranium from the Grants deposits in New Mexico between 1950 and 2002, and more than 136 million kg of uranium remains as unmined resources [10]. Although it is speculated that uranium mining has a\u21b5ected the water quality and the health of the general population in the area [11], there has been little research focused on the current and future impacts of uranium mining on water resources in the region. Employment of mining in the state began in as early as 1950 with a mine operated by the Kerr McGee Oil Company [12], reaching its peak in 1978, then rapidly declining to almost zero in the 1980s due to the rapid decline in price for uranium. Currently, coal, copper and potash make up the majority (80%) of the mining activity in the state [13]. The Grants district, also referred as the Grants Mineral Belt (Figure 1.1) is lo- cated within the San Juan Basin and is divided up into seven sub-mining districts. These districts are Ambrosia Lake, Church Rock, Crownpoint, Laguna, Marquez, Nose Rock, and Smith Lake. There are approximately 115 identi\ufb01ed bodies of ura- nium resource in the San Juan Basin [10]. The mine site studied in this research is located in the Ambrosia Lake District of the San Juan Basin in the Grants Mineral Belt. The Ambrosia Lake district is historically the most active district and currently has the most momentum for renewed uranium-mining activity. The Roca Honda Mine site was used to quantify the e\u21b5ects of uranium mining on underground resources in the San Juan Basin because it has a record of aquifer properties, historical pumping rates, and it is a proposed site for future uranium mining in New Mexico. Calculations were conducted using the Theis equation (e.g. [4]) and was compared to a MODFLOW 2005 model developed by Intera [2]. Results were validated from historical pumping records via the New Mexico Bureau of Mines and Minerals Resources [1]. These calculations were then conducted via a MATLAB program to allow evaluation of uncertainty and sensitivity to input parameters. 3 Chapter 1. Introduction Figure 1.1: Energy Resource Regions in the San Juan Basin [1] 1.1 Current State of Knowledge Water resources impacts from uranium mining in the San Juan Basin are poorly understood. The information that is generally relied on regarding the hydrogeologic properties of the San Juan Basin originate from a groundwater model developed by Kernodle [14] and aquifer properties de\ufb01ned by [1] in a study by the New Mexico Mines and Minerals Bureau. Interested mining companies hold information about aquifers in the San Juan Basin, but this information is not readily available to the public. Recent attempts at de\ufb01ning the aquifer properties have been focused on 4 Chapter 1. Introduction the Westwater Canyon Member of the Morrison Formation (described below). Data has been collected by Roca Honda Mineral Resources Inc. [2] by constructing a test well and conducting drawdown/recovery tests [15]. This data along with information from [1, 14] was used by Intera to create a three-dimensional (3D) groundwater model using MODFLOW 2005. This model was created to study the potential groundwater impacts of the proposed Roca Honda mine in accordance of meeting environmental impact study (EIS) requirements. 1.2 Geology, Hydrology and Resources of The San Juan Basin (Site Description) The San Juan Basin is located predominately in New Mexico, but the extent of the basin extends into Colorado, Arizona, and a small part of Utah (Figure 1.3). The area of land that it makes up is 54,390 square kilometers. Formed during the Laramide Orogeny, the San Juan basin consists of layers of sedimentary rock that date from the Cambrian to Tertiary age [14]. The geology of the San Juan Basin has been studied mainly from outcroppings and well drilling logs [1]. The general geologic stratigraphy can be seen in Figures 1.3 & 1.2. There are approximately 17 hydrostratigraphic units that range in elevation from approximately 3,048 m above sea level to 3,048 m below sea level Figure 1.2. The conceptual mine that is studied in this report is located near the proposed Roca Honda Mine. It is located near the town of Grants (NM), and North West of the Mt. Taylor Mountains Figure 2.1. The permit area encompasses 7.8 km2 within the San Juan Basin. It is under the ownership and maintenance of the Cibola National Forest. 5 Chapter 1.

Introduction Figure 1.4: Roca Honda Mine Permit Area (U.S. Forest Service, 2013) The layer of most interest to this research is the Morrison formation. The Mor- rison formation is a series of 5 layers, generally consisting of alternating sandstone aquifers and silt and shale aquitards [1]. The layers of the Morrison in the order highest elevation to lowest elevation are the Jackpile formation (sandstone, aquifer), Brushy Basin member (shale, aquitard), Westwater Canyon member (sandstone, aquifer), Recapture member (shale, aquifer), and Salt Wash member (sandstone, 8 Chapter 1. Introduction aquifer). The Westwater Canyon member of the Morrison Formation is the most important geologic layer due to its mineral composition that contains the highest concentrations of uranium.

Introduction aquifer). The Westwater Canyon member of the Morrison Formation is the most important geologic layer due to its mineral composition that contains the highest concentrations of uranium. See Figure 2.1 for a simple schematic of where this mem- ber is located within the Morrison formation. It mainly consists of Sandstone that is intermingled with some shale and clay stone, mainly in the northeastern portion of the San Juan Basin. However, near the Grants Mineral belt the Westwater Canyon member is known to consist entirely of sandstone. The hydrology and hydraulic properties of the San Juan Basin\u2019s groundwater reservoirs are poorly understood although there have been a few studies done on this regional area hydraulic properties [1, 14]. The systems groundwater resources can be assumed to be in steady state equilibrium [14] since the in\ufb02ows of the San Juan Basin\u2019s groundwater system have been calculated to approximately equal the out\ufb02ows [14]. The main source of recharge to the aquifers is through surface water in\ufb01ltration through faults and outcroppings of precipitation that is not consumed through evaporation, sublimation and transpiration [14]. The main sources of out- \ufb02ows are the aquifers discharging to streams and arroyos, most of which have dry beds year-round [2]. Due to these reasons it is estimated that the water budget for the groundwater resources in the San Juan Basin is Qin \u2212Qout = 0 [2]. The hydraulic properties of the Westwater Canyon member are of much interest because it contains the highest concentration of uranium and it will need to be de- watered to extract the uranium resource via under ground mining. These hydraulic properties are known to be highly variable throughout the extent of the San Juan Basin [1]. The Westwater Canyon member has been most widely utilized for uranium mining. A majority of the wells that have been constructed down to the Morrison formation are used for the sole purpose of dewatering uranium-mine sites, though some wells in the area are used for domestic and agricultural use. The current knowledge of the hydraulic properties of this member within the San Juan Basin 9 Chapter 1. Introduction were determined through a series of drawdown and recovery tests performed on 31 wells in the study area [1]. These hydraulic properties can be found in Table 1 and are explained later in the methods section. Another study available was done in 2011 and described some limited aquifer properties of the Westwater Canyon member at the proposed Roca Honda Mine site through a similar drawdown and recovery test previously done by [1, 15]. These parameters are described in the methods section, Table 2.1. 1.3 History of Mining in the Grants district of the San Juan Basin It was not until the mid 1940s in the United States that uranium was a highly valuable commodity. This was mainly due to the development of the atomic bomb in Los Alamos, New Mexico. It was originally believed that uranium ore would have had to be imported from far away locations such as Africa or Canada [16] but uranium ore was discovered near Grants and the Haystack Mountain in 1950 [16]. The Ambrosia Lake region was soon to follow in 1955 being only 25 miles northwest of Grants. This region, as we know it today, has been the largest producing region of uranium in U.S. history, containing much of the highest-grade uranium ever mined in the United States. Uranium production in the San Juan Basin was previously the largest producer of uranium in the United States. New Mexico alone in 1978 produced 18.3 million kg of uranium, making up 47 percent of the total uranium mined in the United States during that time. Production began to decline in 1979 due to a decline in uranium prices by up to 25% [16]. The lowered uranium prices caused a major decline in mining activity and by 1987, after the tragedy in Chernobyl, most uranium mining 10 Chapter 1. Introduction had ceased in the San Juan Basin. In the San Juan Basin there have been over 200 documented mines in the 7 sub- districts (McLemore, 2013). Over the 52 years of production of uranium, there have been over 154 million kg of uranium documented originating from the Grants District and over 136 million kg remain unmined [10]. These uranium deposits have a range of concentration ranging from the highest grade (calculated in kg U3O8 kg Soil ) 0.5% near Mt. Taylor to lower than 0.1% in many other parts of the district. The majority of uranium resources have been mined from the Morrison formation, speci\ufb01cally 1.5*108 kg of uranium has been mined from it [10]. Only 212,281 kg of uranium has been mined from all other sandstone formations in the Grants District [10]. Presently, uranium prices are still impacted by the disaster at Fukushima, Japan in 2011 [17]. Uranium prices were on the rise, projected to reach $63.50/kg, but shortly after the nuclear plant failure prices of uranium dropped to around $18.14/kg. The volatility of uranium prices has been the most probable reason for no re- newed uranium mining activity in the San Juan Basin. There has been some in- terest in renewing mining activity in New Mexico. There are currently seven dif- ferent companies in the process of assessing and acquiring permits to begin min- ing. The companies interested in beginning mining include Strathmore Resources US Ltd. (http://www.strathmoreminerals.com ), Uranium Resources, Inc.

Introduction approval from the state of New Mexico and is hoping to commence mining activity in 2016. This area has been identi\ufb01ed to contain a large reserve of uranium (7.62 million kg of uranium) at a relatively high grade (0.404%). 12 Chapter 2 Research Methods 2.1 Conceptual Model Framework An analytical model was constructed that applies the Theis equation\u2019s Cooper Ja- cob straight-line approximation [4] to quantify the \ufb02ow rate and volume of water extracted from a single mine. The conceptual mine was constructed to allow the ex- traction of ore from the Westwater Canyon formation near the proposed Roca Honda Mine site by dewatering the aquifer. The Westwater Canyon formation aquifer is a known con\ufb01ned aquifer that exists between two aquitards, i.e., the Brushy Basin Member and the Recapture Member. These aquitards are de\ufb01ned to not contribute any water to the Westwater Canyon formation. To extract the ore, a shaft must be drilled and the aquifer must be initially dewatered to the radius of the shaft to com- mence mining. This initial time to sink the shaft and dewater the aquifer is dictated by numerous factors, and for this model it was assumed to be 2 years so that it can be compared to the conditions of the proposed Roca Honda Mine. To extract the ore, horizontal shafts (known as stopes) are blasted, scraped out, and supported by pillars along the horizontal axis that contains the ore body. The radius of the mine 13 Chapter 2. Research Methods is expected to expand at a constant rate for a time period of ten years, and the mine must be dewatered to the e\u21b5ective radius as it is expanding over time. Although the time period for the conceptual mine can contribute to the scenario uncertainty, it was selected to remain constant to simulate a comparable situation to the proposed Roca Honda mine. These physical and situational parameters were then incorporated into the Theis equation so that the \ufb02ow rates from the conceptual mine could be quanti\ufb01ed. The output of the conceptual mine calculations is the discharge required to maintain the level of drawdown required by the e\u21b5ective radius as it expands.

Research Methods The application of the Theis equation to quantify the discharge (Q) and volumet- ric water withdrawals were employed through MATLAB. The code associated with these MATLAB calculations can be reviewed in Appendix A and B. 2.2 Groundwater Calculations To approximate the e\u21b5ects of a conceptual mine near the proposed Roca Honda Mine, the \ufb02ow rate required to dewater the Westwater Canyon Member for mining activity was estimated using the Theis Equation. This method estimates the pump- ing rates and ultimately volume of water required for mining activity in the Morrison formation. For the application of the Theis equation, the following assumptions were made about the conceptual mine and aquifer modeled in this research [4]. \u2022 The aquifer is homogeneous, isotropic, of uniform thickness, and of in\ufb01nite area extent. \u2022 Before pumping the piezometric surface is horizontal. \u2022 The well is pumped at a constant discharge rate. \u2022 The pumped well penetrates the entire aquifer, and \ufb02ow is everywhere hori- zontal within the aquifer to the well. \u2022 The well diameter is in\ufb01nitesimal so that storage within the well can be ne- glected. \u2022 Water removed from storage is discharged instantaneously with decline of head. In reality these assumptions are rarely met although it is accepted by the scienti\ufb01c community that while all assumptions are not met, the Theis equation can give a 15 Chapter 2. Research Methods good approximation of ground water calculations [5\u20137]. The Theis equation has been adapted by other methods of analysis such as the Cooper-Jacob approximation and Chow Method so that simpler approximations can be readily made in the \ufb01eld [4]. The Theis equation(equation 2.1) relates a discharge, aquifer drawdown, and the physical properties of the aquifer that a\u21b5ect \ufb02ow in a transient groundwater system. s = Q 4\u21e1T W(u) (2.1) Where, Q is the discharge (L3/t), T is the transmissivity (L2/t), pi (unitless) is equal to 3.14, and W(u) is the well function of u (L), s is equal to the drawdown (L). u (Eq. 2.2) is referred to as the exponential integral and is determined as follows: u = r2S 4Tt (2.2) Where r is the radius of the well (L), S is the Storage Coe\ufb03cient (unitless), and t is the time since the beginning of pumping.

For small values of r and large values of t, u is small therefore making the values after the 2nd term in Equation 2.3 negligible. This is why the Cooper-Jacob approximation is allowed. The Cooper-Jacob approximation results in a straight-line relationship between t and s. For all calculations of \ufb02ow-rate using equation 2.4 the initial radius of the mine (r) is 3.1 m and will increase with time as de\ufb01ned in Equation 2.6. To simulate the conditions of a conceptual uranium mine, the radius of the mine will expand at a constant rate associated with the time vector t. The expansion rate is de\ufb01ned to have units of (L/t). The drawdown depth (s) for the conceptual mine is de\ufb01ned as the depth of water that must be removed measured as the top of the piezometeric head above the aquifer to the bottom of the aquifer at the edge of the mine radius, see Equation 2.7. This is to simulate the condition that a dry mine well must be maintained so that uranium ore can be extracted from the mine. r = 3.1 + (expansion rate) \u21e4t (2.6) s = (depth of piezometetric head above aquifer) + (aquifer thickness) (2.7) The Theis Cooper-Jacob approximation (Eq. 2.4) was used for all of the calcu- lations of discharge from the conceptual mine in this research. To ensure that these calculations did not have large errors, the exponential integral u was calculated at each step to ensure it was less than 0.01. 17 Chapter 2. Research Methods 2.2.1 Model Parameters The parameters used for the analysis of the conceptual mine studied in this research consist of both physical and situational parameters (T, S, t, s, and r) of Equation 2.4. How these parameters where used are explained below and are used in both the uncertainty analysis and the sensitivity analysis. The constant values and ranges in which the parameters have been analyzed are summarized in Table 2.1. Transmissivity represents the rate at which water \ufb02ows horizontally through an aquifer and is de\ufb01ned in this model in units of meters squared per day. Transmissiv- ity ranges between values of 0.19 m2/d to 44.6 m2/d within the San Juan Region [1]. From the pumping test performed within the permit area of the Roca Honda Re- sources (RHR) Mine site, a better understanding of the transmissivity was achieved. It ranges between the values of 6 m2/d to 11.6 m2/d [15]. The constant value for transmissivity is 10.6 m2/d this is the median value of transmissivity in the West- water Canyon member of the San Juan Basin de\ufb01ned in [1]. The transmissivity parameter was evaluated between both the regional range and the RHR mine site range to better understand how the spatial variability a\u21b5ects the \ufb01nal water resource impact. The storage coe\ufb03cient represents the property of the Westwater Canyons Member to store water. The storage coe\ufb03cient ranges between 0.00002 - 0.0002 [1]. Since Roca Honda Resources de\ufb01ned the value of the storage coe\ufb03cient within the Roca Honda Mine site to be 0.00024 [15], it was used as the constant value for analysis. Depth of drawdown, measured in meters, represents the drawdown parameter s of the Cooper-Jacobs approximation of the Theis Equation (Eq. 2.4). The piezometric head in the Westwater Canyon Member is known to be around 243.8-274.3 m above the top of the aquifer near the Roca Honda Mine site [2] and the thickness of the aquifer is known to vary between 30.5 and 121.9 m [1], making the depth of drawdown 18 Chapter 2. Research Methods to range between 274.3-396.2 m. The constant value for aquifer thickness was selected to be 76.2 m as this was the median value de\ufb01ned by [1] for the Westwater Canyon member in the San Juan Basin. The constant value of 243.8 m for the piezometric head of the Westwater Canyon member above the top of the aquifer was chosen to compare to the proposed Roca Honda mine as this was the value used in the groundwater impact calculations made by Hydroscience Associates Inc. (2011). Expansion rate, measured in meters per day, represents the rate at which the ini- tial mine radius of 3.1 m will expand each day due to mining activity. The expansion rate can be considered part of the scenario uncertainty that will be explained later. It is not a known parameter and thus the range of 0.3 to 1.5 m/d was considered. Other scenario parameters include the time of initial dewatering and time to sink the mineshaft. These have both been lumped into one parameter so that it can be compared to the proposed Roca Honda Mine and is set to 2 years. The constant value of 1.5 m/d was selected for the expansion rate since there were no values to compare to the situation. The remaining two situational parameters summarized in Table 2.1, initial dewa- tering/time to sink shaft, and duration of mining have potential ranges of values that are not known and were estimated. The constant values were chosen to compare to the proposed Roca Honda Mine [2]. The model parameter of the time step allows the conceptual model to calculate the instantaneous volume discharged from the mine during di\u21b5erent times during the dewatering and mining period. Since the model input of t is the time since the beginning of pumping the time step would begin with a value of 30 days increasing"

The uncertainty analysis involved the parameters (T, S, t, s, 20 Chapter 2. Research Methods and r) of Equation 2.4. This was conducted to determine which parameters have the greatest uncertainty, the range in which they vary, and which parameters have the greatest e\u21b5ect on the \ufb02ow rate from the dewatering mines and volume of water extracted from the aquifer. Since knowledge about the San Juan Basin and its aquifer parameters consist of empirical data such as observations many of the known ranges of values have an associated uncertainty. One source of uncertainty comes from the measurement of these parameters. It exists because there is only one set of data used to determine the aquifer parameters and this data is limited to only 31 well tests across the entire San Juan Basin [1]. Another source of uncertainty comes from applying these parameters as if they were uniform across the entire San Juan basin. In systems this large and variable, this assumption introduces uncertainty to calculations. In reality it is understood that these parameters are not uniform and that for each individual location the properties of the aquifers are di\u21b5erent from site to site. There are at least three types of uncertainty that are involved with any un- certainty analysis, parameter, scenario, and model uncertainty [18]. Many of the physical parameters such as T, S, and aquifer thickness used to quantify the e\u21b5ects of dewatering a mine for uranium extraction in the San Juan basin are uncertain because they rely on the limited knowledge about the geology and aquifer properties of the ore bodies, these are the parameters that have been modeled in this research to understand the parameter uncertainty. Furthermore, there is general uncertainty about future mining activity in the area such as expansion rate of the mine, time it will take to sink the mineshaft, and the duration that mining activity will oc- cur. These are the parameters that contribute to the scenario uncertainty. Since the proposed Roca Honda Mine has been used to de\ufb01ne some of these scenario parame- ters [2], the only scenario parameter that was studied for uncertainty in this research is the expansion rate. Finally, there is general uncertainty involved in how the model 21 Chapter 2. Research Methods is constructed. It must be noted that a model that simulates a conceptual uranium mine can be constructed in many di\u21b5erent ways and that parameters such as the length of the time step or the modeling program that the conceptual model was cal- culated in can inevitably a\u21b5ect the \ufb01nal outcome and can contribute to uncertainty. No model uncertainty was modeled in this research, but it could be incorporated in future work. The calculations for uncertainty were performed using the Theis Cooper-Jacob approximation through a MATLAB code that allowed for multiple simulations of various con\ufb01gurations of parameters. This MATLAB code simulated the mining conditions of the proposed Roca Honda Mine by using the parameters de\ufb01ned in Ta- ble 2.1. The MATLAB code allowed the transmissivity, storage coe\ufb03cient, depth of drawdown, and expansion rate parameters to vary randomly for each iteration within its range of known values. It was assumed that all values of input parameters are equally likely (uniform distribution) unless it was de\ufb01ned as a constant value, since the information about the spatial variability of these values was not known. With more information about how these parameters vary throughout the San Juan Basin, di\u21b5erent types of distributions for the physical parameters could be selected. 100,000 iterations of the model were performed for each variation of the model described be- low. The output of the model at each iteration was a total volume extracted for the 12 year simulation period. To better understand how the parameters that had a variable range of values and did not have a single constant value de\ufb01ned in Table 2.1 (transmissivity, storage coe\ufb03cient, depth of drawdown, and expansion rate) it was studied how they a\u21b5ected the uncertainty of the total volume extracted from the conceptual mine. Three di\u21b5erent scenarios were used to evaluate this uncertainty. The \ufb01rst scenario (scenario"

Three di\u21b5erent scenarios were used to evaluate this uncertainty. The \ufb01rst scenario (scenario 1) studied allowed all of the parameters to be varied randomly between their value ranges with a uniform distribution. The second scenario (scenario 2) allowed each 22 Chapter 2. Research Methods parameter to be held constant while the others varied randomly so that the e\u21b5ect each parameter on the uncertainty analysis could be studied. Finally, scenarios one and two were performed in the same fashion while using the transmissivity values de\ufb01ned by RHR\u2019s pump test (Table 2.1) so that the e\u21b5ect of the spatial variability of this parameter could be studied (scenario 3). 2.2.3 Sensitivity Analysis Methods The parameters used to calculate the \ufb02ow rate and \ufb01nal volume of water removed from the Westwater Canyon Member for uranium mining are known to exist over a range of values within the San Juan Basin, see Table 2.1 [1, 15]. By varying each parameter within its known range while holding the other parameter values constant, the sensitivity of the resultant \ufb02ow rate and total volume removed can be better understood. The parameters that were varied are transmissivity, storage coe\ufb03cient, depth of drawdown, and expansion rate. The sensitivity analysis was performed by calculating the groundwater \ufb02ow rate required for extracting uranium at the proposed Roca Honda Mine over a 12-year time period. The conceptual model described earlier was used for this calculation by holding all of the parameters at their constant value (Table 2.1) while allowing one parameter vary across its range of values describes in Table 2.1. The parameters that where studied for sensitivity are transmissivity, storage coe\ufb03cient, depth of drawdown, and expansion rate. This allowed for a better understanding of how each parameter a\u21b5ected the \ufb02ow rate. 23 Chapter 3 Results 3.1 Veri\ufb01cation of Model Two methods were used to verify the results of the analytical model. For both methods, the historical data from the NM Bureau of Mine & Minerals Resources (NMBMMR) [1] were used to compare observed \ufb02ow rates to modeled \ufb02ow rates (Table 3.2). The \ufb01rst way the model was veri\ufb01ed was through a single run of the analytical model with a time vector of 12 years using the aquifer parameters that are determined by [1] as median values in the Morrison formation. Since these are accepted values for the aquifer parameters of the Morrison formation that is why they were used as the criterion of the Morrison aquifer during the \ufb01rst validation method. The parameters used in the \ufb01rst veri\ufb01cation method can be seen in Table 3.1. The resulting \ufb02ow rate from the model is 10.98 m3/s and is only about 10% di\u21b5erent from the historical \ufb02ow rates reported for mining in the Ambrosia Lake District (Table 3.2). This serves to verify that the method used in this analysis is a reasonable approximation. The second way that the results of this model was veri\ufb01ed is by comparing the 24 Chapter 3. Results Table 3.1: Parameters Used for 1st Method of Model Veri\ufb01cation, data from Kernodle (1996) and Hydrosceince Associates Inc.

The median volume from this analysis is 6.07*107 m3. This volume, when averaged over 12 years, equates to a \ufb02ow rate of 9.6 m3/min. It can be seen in Table 3.2 that this \ufb02ow rate is only 1.5% di\u21b5erent from the historical values reported for mining the Ambrosia Lake District (Table 3.2) and serves to verify that the method used in this analysis is a reasonable approximation. Previous attempts of validating the parameters used by [14] have been made by Roca Honda Resources (RHR). A test well was installed in the area near the proposed Roca Honda Mine that provides some limited data on the hydraulic properties of the Westwater Canyon member. The data about the hydraulic properties from the Westwater Canyon Member collected by the test well can be seen in Table 2.1, [15]. Since the aquifer parameters reported by RHR lies within the reported hydraulic parameter range reported by [1], the parameters used for the Roca Honda mine permit site can be considered validated as well. 25 Chapter 3.

By performing the conceptual model within the speci\ufb01ed parameters ranges, a range of resultant \ufb02ow rates and volumes of water removed from the Westwater Canyon member for ura- nium mining from a conceptual mine was determined. This will help to give a better understanding of how much each individual parameter can a\u21b5ect the \ufb01nal volume of groundwater extracted. The results of the sensitivity analysis are presented in Figure 3.1 as well as Table 3.3 so that a comparison of how each parameter a\u21b5ects the \ufb02ow rate and total volume extracted to its minimum, and maximum value within its speci\ufb01ed range can be determined. One note about Figure 3.1 is that the scenario for the max storage coe\ufb03cient and max expansion rate coincidentally had the same parameters. This is why they have the same values in Figure 3.1. The \u201dTransmissivity RHR\u201d in the legend of Figure 3.1 corresponds to holding the transmissivity parameter values between what was determined during the pump test performed on the Roca Honda Mine permit site, (6.0-11.6 m2/d).

Results Figure 3.1: Time dependence Parameter Sensitivity It can be seen in Figure 3.1 that when the transmissivity values were allowed to range between what is accepted within the entire San Juan Basin, the values of \ufb02ow rates are the largest compared to the other \ufb02ow rates. Once this range is reduced to the RHR permit site where there is a better understanding of what parameter values truly exist, transmissivity no longer causes the greatest increase to \ufb02ow rate in the model. Once transmissivity is less variable, the parameters of the model are approximately equally sensitive to their known or estimated ranges. 3.3 Uncertainty Analysis Results The following \ufb01gures 3.3, 3.4, 3.6, 3.7, 3.2, 3.5 and tables 3.4 and 3.5 summarize the output from the three uncertainty scenarios de\ufb01ned in the methods section. Results are presented graphically in three ways. The \ufb01rst method is presented through a histogram that plots the number times the resultant volume occurs for each iteration of the 100,000 iterations versus the resultant volume extracted from the conceptual 28 Chapter 3. Results mine over 12 years (Figures 3.3 and 3.2). This allows the reader to determine the distribution of volumes extracted for each scenario. Figures 3.3, 3.4, 3.6 and 3.7 present Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) graphs that allow the reader to quickly gather information about each scenario\u2019s modeled volume of water extracted by displaying the probabilities during the 100,000 simulations performed for analysis. Finally, this information is summarized in Tables 3.4 and 3.5 for quick comparisons among the scenarios modeled. It was found that for scenario 1 the total volume of water extracted during the 12-year simulation had a broader distribution (Figure 3.3) than other scenarios. The values for the \ufb01nal water extracted between the 10% and 90% probabilities (Figure 3.2) were 2.53*107 m3 and 9.91*107 m3 (Table 3.4). The results of what type of statistical distribution this result produces was not explored although future work could be focused on the relevance of the distribution for better understanding the results. Figure 3.2: Distribution of Scenario 1 29 Chapter 3. Results Figure 3.3: Cumulative Distribution Function of Scenario 1 Figure 3.4: Cumulative Distribution Function Plots from Scenario 2 In scenario 2 the result of holding each parameter constant that was previously allowed to vary randomly in scenario 1 made for a better understanding of which parameter contributed the greatest amount of uncertainty. When Figures 3.3 and 30 Chapter 3. Results 3.4 are compared, it can be seen that while the parameters depth of drawdown, storage coe\ufb03cient, and expansion rate are held constant, they have similar results of scenario 1, but when transmissivity is held constant it does not. The e\u21b5ect of the transmissivity parameter has on the uncertainty of the results is signi\ufb01cant and will be addressed in the discussion.

For this, a conceptual mine was modeled using the Theis equation, whose parameters were informed from the physical characteristics present at the proposed Roca Honda Mine in the Grants Mineral Belt, Ambrosia Lake District. This research quanti\ufb01ed the sensitivity of the model parameters within the area so that future work can be focused towards the most sensitive parameters and that more accurate quanti\ufb01cation of future water resource impacts can be calculated. This research explored the uncertainty that is involved in modeling this situation and provided quanti\ufb01ed results within con\ufb01dence bounds so that better decisions can be made concerning the existing water resource. The sensitivity of the parameters that was calculated in this research provided \ufb02ow rates and volumes of potential water extracted for uranium mining. Transmis- sivity, among the other parameters evaluated for its sensitivity had the largest range of \ufb02ow rates and volumes. This parameter has long been known to cause the most variance in groundwater impact. Since it is understood that this parameter is not 34 Chapter 4. Discussion well de\ufb01ned, the estimates of groundwater \ufb02ow rates tend to use conservatively high values of groundwater pumping for uranium mining [2]. Each parameter such as the situational rate at which a mine will expand, storage coe\ufb03cient, and depth of the water table each individually have enough uncertainty about what \ufb02ow rates and volumes a potential uranium mine could extract. When combined together, they have similar if not greater impacts on calculations than the transmissivity alone. Since the majority of previous research about the groundwater impacts of ura- nium mining use parameters that are part of a spatial area that covers the entire 54,390 km2 of the San Juan Basin, parameters such as transmissivity have a large range of values. The parameter that contributes the greatest amount of sensitivity and uncertainty in the analysis of this model is the transmissivity parameter. This can be seen in both the sensitivity results and the uncertainty results (Tables 3.4 and 3.5, Figures 3.2-3.5). When this value is more tightly bound to a spatial area of 7.8 km2, like in the case of the Roca Honda Resources pump test of the permit site [15], the results are more constrained (Table 3.5, Figures 3.5,3.6,3.7. Being that this is one of the \ufb01rst attempts at calculating \ufb02ow rates from ura- nium mining dewatering wells the distributions of the inputs of physical, model, and scenario parameters in the model was not known. Since there was no information about the distributions of the parameters used in this research, the distribution was selected to be a uniform distribution. Gathering more information about these pa- rameters could allow for a most customized distribution and allow for a comparison of what di\u21b5erent distributions can do to a\u21b5ect the resulting ground water impacts. The uncertainty analysis provides a range of values that serves to allow for better decisions to be made about groundwater pumping for underground uranium min- ing. The uncertainty analysis allows the reader to understand that there are many potential impacts that uranium mining in the San Juan Basin can cause to ground- water resources. For example, it is interesting to note that from the results of the 35 Chapter 4. Discussion uncertainty analysis, the calculated \ufb02ow rates were on average below the current projections that Roca Honda Resources have published in the DEIS report for the proposed Roca Honda mine. The volume of 9.18*107 m3 was one of the highest re- sults that this particular model calculated, and it was the singular value that RHR\u2019s used as the groundwater impact over a modeled 12 year mining period. It is not known what range of values RHR\u2019s model calculated when modeling dewatering for the mine but it can be assumed they experienced a similar distribution of \ufb02ow rates and volumes of water extracted for uranium mining, similar to what was calculated in this report. It can be seen in the results of the uncertainty analysis that a large range of calculated \ufb01nal volumes and \ufb02ow rates imply that these calculations are uncertain. 36 Chapter 5 Conclusion The results from the conceptual mine based on the proposed Roca Honda Mine incorporated the Theis"

The advantage of using this simple technique allowed for a greater range of possibilities to be studied in a shorter period of time versus other modeling techniques such as Mod\ufb02ow 2005 among other groundwater modeling programs. Future work could be conducted to more thoroughly understand the model uncertainty by modeling the same situation and parameters with di\u21b5erent modeling programs or equations. The goal of this research was to increase the knowledge about the groundwater impacts of uranium mining in the San Juan Basin. One of the ways this research can be useful is that it provides a range of quanti\ufb01ed results within calculated prob- abilities where other studies do not. This can also be useful as a comparison to an environmental impact statement (EIS) provided by a mining company. This EIS could have a di\u21b5erent method for calculating groundwater impacts that do not take into account or recognize that the parameters they are using are uncertain for the associated calculations. Another way this research can be useful is that it provides 37 Chapter 5. Conclusion a better understanding of what volumes and \ufb02ow rates can be expected from poten- tial uranium mines in the San Juan Basin. With this information provided in this research better understanding of groundwater impacts of uranium mining in the San Juan basin and can be used to make better decisions about future mining activity in the area. 38 References [1] William Jay Stone et al.
