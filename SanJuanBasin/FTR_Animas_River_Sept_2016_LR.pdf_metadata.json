After the August 5, 2015 Gold King Mine released metal and sludge-laden water into Cement Creek and the Animas River, our agency undertook a hydrologic assessment of the Animas River and its nearby alluvial aquifer in New Mexico, from the Colorado state line to Farmington, NM. The purpose of this project is to evaluate possible effects from the mine release on the shallow ground- water near the Animas River. To accomplish this, it requires understanding the seasonal changes to the surface water-groundwater hydraulics and long-term monitoring of the groundwater quality conditions along the NM reach of the Animas River. In August 2015, in collaboration with other agencies (U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), NM Office of the State Engineer (NMOSE), and NM Environment Department (NMED)), we collected groundwater level measurements at over 100 loca- tions along the Animas River. Water quality samples were initially collected by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) and their contractors in August 2015. Using the network of private domes- tic wells established in August 2015, we developed a repeat sampling program for groundwater quality and a groundwater levels along the Animas River valley. The well sites discussed in this report are found on Figure 1. This report serves as a final summary of the work completed between August I . I n t r o d u c t i o n 2015 and June 2016, which include sampling events in January, March, and late May-early June 2016. Additionally, we also incorporate water quality results from the U.S. EPA\u2019s August 2015 results, and the water level measurements from August 2015. Regional geology T he Animas River in northwest New Mexico flows over the northwestern margin of the San Juan Basin (Figure 3). The Animas River from the CO-NM bor- der flows through the Quaternary alluvial deposits. Most private domestic wells in the valley rely on the alluvial aquifer for drinking water and irrigation, with well depths of about 30 to 60 feet. The underlying and surrounding geology along the Animas River from Riverside to Farmington transitions from younger to older bedrock going southward. In the Riverside\u2014Cedar Hill region, the nearby surrounding hills/mesas are composed primarily of Eocene (~50\u201355 Ma) San Jose Formation and Paleocene (~60\u201365 Ma) Nacimiento Formation. The Nacimiento Formation interfingers with the Paleocene Ojo Alamo Sandstone, which is more predominant around Aztec, New Mexico. Along the river in the proximity of Farmington, outcrops of late Cretaceous (~75 Ma) Kirtland Shale are found. The majority of the New Mexico reach of the Animas River flows over the Nacimiento Formation deposits. There are no major structural features (i.e. faults or folds) along the river corridor.

Appendix A is comprehensive, with all wells sampled or visited, with the sites provided from U.S. EPA sampling in August 2015. All site locations discussed in this report are shown on Figure 1. Well sites listed in Table 1 were located using handheld GPS locations. Recently, a LiDAR dataset was flown (October 2014), which we acquired from Earth Data Analysis Center at University of New Mexico. The dataset collected over the Animas River Valley was sim- plified to a 1 m2 resolution with an elevation accuracy of 7\u201316 cm. The improved spatial resolution of the LiDAR dataset allows us to more accurately estimate the water level elevation based on the higher resolution ground surface elevation. To understand the general groundwater flow dynamics throughout the alluvial aquifer a water table was contoured for each sampling period from wells found in Table 2. For the purposes of groundwater level contouring, the Animas River was considered to be to hydrologically linked to the water table. The eleva- tion of the river was determined by using a network of three USGS flow gauges found along the Animas River, in addition to the LiDAR dataset. The stage of the river during which the LiDAR dataset was collected was correlated with the three river gauge elevations to more accurately represent river stage during each sampling period. In order to accurately estimate the groundwater flow dynamic between the river and the alluvial aquifer, each well was compared with its closest corresponding river stage. This allowed us to observe the magnitude of the groundwater flow; to, or from the river. Water levels were measured following USGS protocols for a steel tape measurement device with repeat measurements to within 0.02 ft. All manual groundwater level measurements are found in Appendix B. Larger files of water level data from pressure transducers with data recorders are available upon request. Well selection priorities for water chemistry sampling included 1) proximity to Animas River, 2) proximity to irrigation ditches, 3) wells that were previ- ously sampled by U.S. EPA in August 2015, and 4) wells with owners that were cooperative and willing to permit repeated sampling. Sampling protocols used by NMBGMR are described in more detail in Timmons et al. (2013), and for this project include purging the well until field parameters are stable (pH, dissolved oxygen, specific conductivity, oxidation-reduction potential (ORP), and temperature). Most of these wells are shallow domestic wells and used regularly, therefore well bore water is mobile (frequently in use). For this project, samples were collected for total and dissolved trace metals, cations, anions, and stable isotopes of hydrogen and oxygen. In this region, seasonal sampling for the Animas River is variable and can include high flows (during snowmelt) and low flows (baseflow, winter), as well as irrigation onset and monsoon storm events (Figure 2). For this study, we examined the \u201cbaseflow\u201d condi- tions on the Animas River from January 18\u201320, 2016 for groundwater levels, and water chemistry sampling occurred from January 25\u201327, 2016. Upon initiation of snowmelt, and onset of distribution of irrigation water in the Animas Valley, we collected water lev- els and water chemistry samples from wells between March 14\u201318, 2016. Capturing approximately the peak of snowmelt runoff, with high flow rates through the Animas River, we collected water levels and water chemistry samples again between May 31-June 3, 2016. Groundwater level measurements are found in Appendix B, and chemical data from water sampling are presented in Appendix C. I I .

The goal was to observe the fluctua- tions of the water table throughout the Animas River Valley from the Colorado border to Farmington, NM in order to identify sections of the river where groundwater and surface water may have chemical or water quality interactions. Repeat water level mea- surements are important to understand the seasonal fluctuation in a groundwater system, particularly one that is hydraulically connected to surface water fea- tures such as the Animas River, or irrigation ditches. Following the August GKM release, measurements of depth-to-water (groundwater level or water level elevation) were completed four times in this network. The four water level measurement campaigns were scheduled as to capture hydraulic conditions at distinct seasonal transitions (Figure 2). The initial water level measurement period in August 2015 included 111 wells, and represented monsoon season along with irrigation season. The monitoring network was set to 50 to 80 wells for the following periods of measurement, including baseflow (January 2016), initial snowmelt/onset of irrigation season (March 2016), and peak snowmelt/extended irrigation sea- son (May-June 2016). Occasionally, wells were not measured during one or more of the measurement campaigns due to scheduling conflicts, freezing well conditions or if well owners opted out of the program. Table 2 shows the well listing with the frequency of monitoring. The first round of water level measurements from 111 wells were collected in August 2015, dur- ing monsoon season and while irrigation had been underway for several months. More importantly, the August measurements characterize the hydraulic conditions in the valley at the time of the GKM spill, highlighting portions of the alluvial aquifer that may have been impacted. Using these water level measure- ments, the water table throughout the valley was contoured (Figure 4A). Four of the wells had water level elevations measured below the stage of the river in August 2015, by 0.32 ft on average. The wells below river stage elevation were AR-0060, AR-0063, AR-0075, and AR-0096. The measurements conducted in January 2016 represent baseflow conditions in the Animas River, when flow in the river is dominated by addition of regional groundwater. During this period, 74 wells were measured to construct the January 2016 water table map (Figure 4B). Compared to August, the aver- age water level elevation declined during this period by 2.18 ft. The majority of the decline took place distal from the river (Table 3). The water level in eleven wells was below the stage of the river by 1.59 ft on average. The wells with water level elevations below river stage elevation were AR-0053, AR-0058, AR-0059, AR-0060, AR-0075, AR-0096, AR-0101, AR-0103, AR-0105, AR-0112, and AR-0113. These eleven wells, which may suggest losing conditions along the Animas River, are located between Aztec and Cedar Hill, NM, in the northern portion of the study area. The third round of measurements were con- ducted in March 2016 during the transition from I I I .

Analysis of the fluctuations in groundwater level (in feet) based on distance from the river between each sampling period. To compare the change in water level between individual sampling periods the more recent water level average measurement was subtracted from the previous average water level. Only wells with measurements from each of the four periods were used in this analysis (52 wells). (n = the number of wells in each of the \u2018distance from river\u2019 categories).

Sixty wells were measured during this interval and used to delineate the water table (Figure 4C). The average groundwater level declined by another 1.02 ft since the previous measurement period in January. Seven of the wells, located between Aztec and Cedar Hill, NM, were below the stage of the river by 1.76 ft on average. The wells with water level elevations below river stage elevation were AR-0059, AR-0060, AR-0075, AR-0087, AR-0094, AR-0103, and AR-0112. Wells that may suggest losing conditions are found north of Aztec, with a cluster near Inca, NM. The measurements conducted from May 31st - June 3rd, 2016 capture the hydrologic conditions during peak snowmelt runoff, when the river is at its highest stage. The 12 year average peak in snow- melt runoff for the Animas River below Aztec, NM (USGS:09364010) has typically occurred between May 21st and June 8th. This year, 2016, the peak occurred between June 6th and June 12th. During this sampling period, 65 wells were measured to construct the June 2016 water table map (Figure 4D). Between the March measurements and early June the average water level elevation increased by 3.36 ft. While on average the water table and river were highest during this period, seven of the wells were still below the stage of the river by 0.78 ft on average. The wells below river stage elevation were AR-0056, AR-0060, AR-0063, AR-0072, AR-0075, AR-0087, and AR-0102. Our observations show that in a broad sense, the Animas River is gaining water from the ground- water, as groundwater from the surrounding valley flows downhill, or down gradient, discharging to the river. However, by looking at the water levels in close proximity to the river, we found that the water table gradient can be nearly flat (\u201clow gradient\u201d). In some locations (indicated as red points on the water table maps, Figure 4), we observed that the water table elevation is below river elevation, suggesting that the river could add water to the groundwater (a losing river). With a flat water table, fluctuations in the river stage can turn a slightly gaining reach to a slightly losing reach. The difference between groundwater"

Between the March measurements and early June the average water level elevation increased by 3.36 ft. While on average the water table and river were highest during this period, seven of the wells were still below the stage of the river by 0.78 ft on average. The wells below river stage elevation were AR-0056, AR-0060, AR-0063, AR-0072, AR-0075, AR-0087, and AR-0102. Our observations show that in a broad sense, the Animas River is gaining water from the ground- water, as groundwater from the surrounding valley flows downhill, or down gradient, discharging to the river. However, by looking at the water levels in close proximity to the river, we found that the water table gradient can be nearly flat (\u201clow gradient\u201d). In some locations (indicated as red points on the water table maps, Figure 4), we observed that the water table elevation is below river elevation, suggesting that the river could add water to the groundwater (a losing river). With a flat water table, fluctuations in the river stage can turn a slightly gaining reach to a slightly losing reach. The difference between groundwater elevations and the river stage elevation is small (less than 1 ft), so it may not be detected by coarse reso- lution water table mapping. We must also consider effects from pumping groundwater and the cone of depression that may be created along the river when a well pumps. These dynamic effects on the alluvial aquifer were not tested in this evaluation, but are another potential effect on groundwater and surface water interactions and flow directions. Another way to observe the changes in ground- water levels, similar to the summary presented in Table 3, is by presenting change results on a map. Figure 5 shows a series of maps that calculate the change in depth to water between seasonal measure- ments. A negative value and a red colored point indicate that water level dropped between the earlier and the later water level measurement (i.e. August 2015 to January 2016). A rise in groundwater level between periods of measurement is indicated by a green point and a positive value. The larger symbol size is proportional to greater change observed. The result of this series of maps in Figure 5 shows that the water levels are quite responsive to seasonal changes, with declines in the depths to water measurements all along the Animas River alluvial valley. It is also notable that in the region around Inca and just southwest of Aztec, we see larger responses. In baseflow and early snowmelt periods (January and March), these two regions have the largest declines (~6\u201315 ft), while during peak snow- melt, with irrigation season, these regions also have the largest increases (~6\u201312 ft). Detailed Hydraulic Conditions N MBGMR installed pressure transducers with continuous data recorders in four unused wells to collect water level and temperature data every 12 hours. The first two wells, AR-0007, and AR-0028, started in September 2015 (Figure 6A). Two additional wells, AR-0116, and AR-0208, started in January 2016 (Figure 6B). From a con- tinuous record of groundwater level, we can see brief fluctuations in water levels that help us under- stand local or regional effects on the water table in the area. These records of water level change were plotted alongside a precipitation record from Aztec (GHCND:USC00290692), a USGS Animas River flow gauge just below Aztec (USGS:09364010), and a record of flow in nearby irrigation ditches (http://meas.ose.state.nm.us). AR-0007 and AR-00028 are located in the south- ern portion of the study area. AR-0007 is just north of Farmington, 1,500 ft west of the river, and is 20 ft deep. AR-0028 is located 4 miles southwest of Aztec, 300 ft east of the Animas River, and is 32 ft deep. These two southern well records are plotted alongside the \u2018North Farmington\u2019 irrigation ditch gauge. Sharp spikes in the river stage correspond closely with large 9 A n i m a s R i v e r L o n g T e r m M o n i t o r i n g : J u n e , 2 0 1 6 storms in the area, or upriver, in the Animas River catchment. In general, both pressure records show a close hydraulic connection between the water level in the wells and the Animas River stage, small rises in the water level in both wells correlate with sudden rises in river stage. The two pressure records show surprisingly distinct trends in groundwater level. AR-0007, located 4 miles southwest of Aztec, shows a similar trend to the majority of well trends in the area. The water level declines from the peak in the fall fol- lowing the end of the growing season and continues to decline as the irrigation ditches are shut off. The water level continues to decline until the late spring, and then begins to rise sharply. The rise coincides with the beginning of irrigation season, with the ditches flowing. The rise may also be attributed to the arrival of spring snowmelt and the rising of the river stage. The hydrograph record in AR-0028, located just north of Farmington, has a very different trend. The water level at the beginning of the record in the fall is at a low, before beginning to rise in October. Water level rises steadily before leveling out at the beginning of March, and appears to decline slightly before rising sharply at the beginning of April, similar to AR-0028, with the onset of irrigation and snowmelt. AR-0116 and AR-0208 are located in the north- ern portion of the study area. AR-0116 is located 1 mile south of the Colorado border, 2,250 ft west of the river, and is 69 ft deep. AR-0208 is located 2.7 miles northeast of Aztec, NM, 1,500 feet east of the river, and is 28 ft deep. These two northern well hydrographs are plotted alongside the \u2018Twin Rocks\u2019 irrigation ditch gauge. Of all 4 monitoring sites, AR-0116 is farther from the river than the other pressure transducers records, and it is furthest north. Also, where the rest of the pressure transducers are in wells closer to the river, where the groundwater is less than 15 ft bgs, the water level at AR-0116 is ~50 ft bgs. The small scale fluctuations observed on the other hydrographs is absent and AR-0116 has a smoothly declining water level.

At the beginning of May the water level in the well begins to rise gradually, approximately coincident with when irrigation began in the northern reach of the Animas River. AR-0208, northeast of Aztec, NM, is in an area where the water table is quite shallow, only 2-3 ft bgs. The water level in this well declines steadily from highs in early February throughout the entire record. This well shows no response to the beginning of irri- gation season. Water Chemistry Conditions T he NMBGMR team conducted three repeat sampling events along the Animas River between January and June 2016, attempting to sample the same wells each outing. As a summary, during January 25\u201327, 2016, we collected 16 water chemis- try samples; March 14\u201317, 2016, we repeat sampled a total of 18 groundwater samples; and from May 31-June 3, 2016 a total of 19 samples were collected. Tables 1 and 2 list the locations of wells that were sampled, with the complete results of sampling found in Appendix C. A map of sampled wells is shown on Figure 1. Table 4 shows a summary of each period of NMBGMR sampling with average values for field parameters and major ions. Well owners have been notified of their results in writing after sample analy- ses are complete and reviewed.

The maps shown in Figure 7 include symbols, which depict the meq/L cation content (Na, Ca, and Mg) on the left side of the symbol, and anion content (Cl, HCO3, and SO4) on the right side. The maps in Figure 7 show that there is little change in the overall ion chemistry from one sample period to the next. We can observe a trend of lower ion content in the northern reaches of the Animas River alluvial aquifer, and higher ion content in the southern sections (south of Aztec, approximately). Results of groundwater samples displayed on a Piper diagram (Figure 8) show that samples col- lected by NMBGMR (Figure 8A) are comparable to samples collected by U.S. EPA in August 2015 (Figure 8B). However, the U.S. EPA samples (Figure 8B) have higher levels of sodium and chloride than the wells sampled by NMBGMR. The dominant water type for the Animas River aquifer appears to be Ca-HCO3 to Ca-SO4. Figure 8C shows samples from the surrounding geologic formations, not includ- ing the Animas alluvial aquifer (data from Kelley et al., 2014). Water samples from the Animas alluvial aquifer samples have some similarities, especially with anions, to water sourced from the Ojo Alamo Formation (Toa), the Nacimiento Formation (Tn) and the San Jose Formation (Tsj). This comparison supports the hypothesis that there is a component of the groundwater in the Animas River alluvial aquifer that is derived from the surrounding regional geology, and that some groundwater is going into the Animas River (as a gaining river). The Piper diagram in Figure 8D shows the repeated NMBGMR samples for each well location. It is apparent from Figure 8D that the dominant water type for these wells stays fairly constant from one sample period to another. Water quality U.S. EPA samples from August 2015 indicated that some wells had elevated levels of iron, manganese, sulfate, and aluminum above secondary MCL rec- ommendations. These data were compiled from data provided to the state of New Mexico after the sampling was completed. Original documentation on sampling or analysis protocols from U.S. EPA or con- tractors is not available. This leaves some unanswered questions about data collection, reporting or possible transcription errors. Results of water chemistry sampling in January 2016 revealed that some private domestic wells had elevated levels of iron, manganese, aluminum, and sulfate. One well, AR-0075, had total iron at 4.58 mg/L which is above the secondary recommenda- tion (0.3 mg/L), and total manganese at 6.4 mg/L, which is above the health advisory level (1.6 mg/L). We compared results from the January 2016 water chemistry sampling with previous results from U.S. EPA collected in August 2015 for manganese and iron (Figures 9, 10). The result of this analysis showed that in most samples manganese and iron were higher in the January 2016 measurements than in August 2015. Other wells that have elevated levels of both iron and"

The result of this analysis showed that in most samples manganese and iron were higher in the January 2016 measurements than in August 2015. Other wells that have elevated levels of both iron and manganese in January include AR, 0006, AR-0017, AR-0074, AR-0112 and AR-0156. Results of March 2016 water chemistry sampling again indicated that several private domestic wells had elevated levels of iron, manganese, aluminum and sulfate (above secondary recommendations). Again, AR-0075, had total iron at 2.8 mg/L which is above the secondary recommendation (0.3 mg/L), and total manganese at 4.46 mg/L, which is above the health advisory level (0.3 mg/L). Other wells that have elevated levels of both iron and manganese in March include AR-0006, AR-0017, AR-0074 and AR-0112. The samples collected in late May-early June, 2016 showed similar results with elevated levels of iron, manganese and sulfate (above secondary recommendations). Wells AR-0074, AR-0075 and AR-0112 continue to have levels of iron and manga- nese above recommended levels, but no wells on this round had elevated aluminum. In each sample period, the elevated levels of iron and manganese occur in the Cedar Hill and Inca regions (Figures 11 and 12). These are areas where we have also noted possible changes from gaining to losing, from the Animas River to groundwater (Figure 4). Results shown in Figures 9 and 10 indi- cate that levels of total iron and manganese in some wells increased since the August sampling by U.S. EPA (such as AR-0017, AR-0058, AR-0059, and -0102), while others have fluctuated more (AR-0075 and -0156). Comparison of water quality time series results and maps suggest a hypothesis that water quality variations may be related to seasonal influ- ences on the groundwater table. Perhaps minor seasonal changes in gradient along the Cedar Hill and Inca reaches of the Animas, particularly at baseflow river levels, have an impact to groundwater quality related to changes in the oxidizing or reducing condi- tions in the shallow groundwater. Example wells that have very low gradient groundwater\u2014surface water 11 A n i m a s R i v e r L o n g T e r m M o n i t o r i n g : J u n e , 2 0 1 6 elevations with water quality issues include AR-0075 and AR-0112. Then, when irrigation and snowmelt begins, there is a dilution effect. Stable Isotope Analyses R esults from stable isotopes of hydrogen (\u03b4D) from all groundwater samples range from -93 to -104 \u2030, and oxygen (\u03b418O) from -12.5 to -14.4\u2030 (Table 5; Figure 13). Samples from groundwater col- lected during the 3 sample periods in 2016 differ very little for samples at the same well sites (Figure 14). The very \u201clight\u201d ranges of these values suggest that groundwater in the Animas River valley is predomi- nantly recharged by winter precipitation. Starting with the March 2016 sampling period, we collected stable isotopes from the Animas River at three locations (Table 5; Figure 1, 13). In March, these results are \u201cheavier\u201d relative to most ground- water samples, meaning their isotope ratios are more in the range of -95 to -96 \u2030 \u03b4D, and -13.5 to -13.4 \u2030 \u03b418O. Interestingly, the only groundwater stable isotope samples that plot in a similar range are from well site AR-0006. This well location is very close to the river and irrigation ditches. One hypoth- esis for the similarity of this groundwater to the Animas River water is that this well was strongly influenced by river or irrigation water input. Animas River samples from June 2016, during peak snowmelt conditions, are significantly lighter, which reflects the snowmelt source of river water at that Point ID Site type Sample date H2r O18r AR-0006 groundwater 26-Jan-16 -95.9 -13.41 AR-0006 groundwater 15-Mar-16 -96.1 -13.47 AR-0006 groundwater 01-Jun-16 -95.8 -13.48 AR-0008 groundwater 27-Jan-16 -100.2 -13.97 AR-0008 groundwater 14-Mar-16 -100.6 -13.99 AR-0008 groundwater 01-Jun-16 -100.7 -13.97 AR-0010 groundwater 27-Jan-16 -103 -14.15 AR-0010 groundwater 14-Mar-16 -103 -14.26 AR-0010 groundwater 31-May-16 -102.1 -14.1 AR-0015 groundwater 27-Jan-16 -104.1 -14.4 AR-0015 groundwater 16-Mar-16 -104 -14.44 AR-0015 groundwater 01-Jun-16 -104 -14.29 AR-0017 groundwater 27-Jan-16 -103.9 -14.36 AR-0017 groundwater 15-Mar-16 -103.9 -14.36 AR-0017 groundwater 01-Jun-16 -103.9 -14.31 AR-0023 groundwater 03-Jun-16 -103.1 -14.35 AR-0031 groundwater 31-May-16 -92.7 -12.45 AR-0038 groundwater 25-Jan-16 -101.5 -14.03 AR-0038 groundwater 17-Mar-16 -101.2 -14.09 AR-0038 groundwater 31-May-16 -101.1 -13.96 AR-0058 groundwater 15-Mar-16 -99.4 -13.89 AR-0058 groundwater 01-Jun-16 -99.2 -13.73 AR-0059 groundwater 26-Jan-16 -100.7 -14.09 AR-0059 groundwater 15-Mar-16 -101.2 -14.14 AR-0059 groundwater 01-Jun-16 -99.4 -13.8 AR-0073 groundwater 26-Jan-16 -103.5 -14.33 AR-0073 groundwater 15-Mar-16 -103.5 -14.44 AR-0074 groundwater 27-Jan-16 -100.5 -14.1 AR-0074 groundwater 16-Mar-16 -99.1 -13.94 AR-0074 groundwater 03-Jun-16 -100.1 -14.1 Table 5.

Groundwater changes very little over the period of sampling, in terms of stable isotopes. Preliminary Conclusions W e hypothesize that groundwater in the Animas alluvial aquifer is composed of three main com- ponents, 1) regional groundwater from surrounding aquifers, 2) Animas River water, and 3) Animas River water via irrigation distribution. The quantity of these inputs likely varies over the year, depending on surface water flow in the Animas River. With long-term environmental, mine-related, and anthropogenic impacts to water quality along the Animas River, it is important to continue to monitor groundwater quality. Currently, based on the small dataset of 16\u201319 repeat sampled wells, we do not see any direct effects to the shallow alluvial aquifer from the Gold King Mine spill in August 2015. We do, however, see elevated levels of iron, manganese, sulfate and occasionally aluminum in groundwater around the Animas River. We hypothesize, based on numerous anecdotal accounts from land owners, that the water quality changes in summer months with snowmelt, higher river flows and increased irrigation distribution. We observe a decrease in the levels of iron and manganese, which are the dominant constit- uents of concern above the MCL guidelines found in the groundwater. Aluminum levels in a few wells were higher in winter months than in summer, higher flow months. Continued monitoring of groundwater qual- ity, through consistent and repeated measurements, is the only way to confirm or disprove any affects to groundwater related to the Gold King Mine or other contaminant concerns over time. 13 A n i m a s R i v e r L o n g T e r m M o n i t o r i n g : J u n e , 2 0 1 6 W ith future funding, it is important to consider sampling groundwater outside of the Animas alluvial aquifer, which would provide improved end- member comparisons (i.e. regional groundwater). Additionally, comparison of geochemistry and stable isotopes from surface water and irrigation water would aide in the understanding of the composition of inputs to the alluvial aquifer. Analysis of well site depth and distance from the river, with special atten- tion to metals of concern, would also be an important analysis. Adding sites with continuous water quality monitoring can improve the understanding of the background changes in water quality in between sam- pling events. This may be accomplished with continu- ous monitoring of groundwater conductivity, with periodic water quality sampling for comparison. i V .
