Newton et al., (2017) using groundwater level and water chemistry data col- lected between January 2016 and June 2017, characterized the local hydrogeology and looked for evidence of potential impacts from the GKM spill on local groundwater quality. While Newton et al., (2017) found no evidence of groundwater contamination that was directly asso- ciated with the GKM spill, a subsequent study phase was recommended to continue ground- water quality monitoring in the Animas River valley alluvial aquifer and to answer important questions about geochemical processes with implications for potential impacts to groundwater quality by the GKM spill and mitigation of possible future mine waste spills. The dynamic groundwater/surface water interactions in the Animas River valley in New Mexico and poten- tial changes to groundwater quality are important to the communities in the region that face potential contamination of domestic wells from historic mining sources and the GKM spill. This report presents results and conclusions for the second phase of the groundwater study, which focuses on geochemical data for samples collected in fall of 2018 and the spring of 2019. The objectives of this study were: 1. To continue monitoring of groundwater quality and confirm or refute general findings of Newton et al., (2017) specifically related to the hydrogeologic conceptual model; 2. To assess sources of dissolved constituents in shallow groundwater along the Animas River in New Mexico; 3. To assess the occurrence of high manganese and iron concentrations in shallow groundwater; 4. To evaluate redox conditions and processes within the shallow aquifer that affect the solubility of metals associated with the GKM spill; 5. To identify areas in the Animas Valley where surface water, including the river and irrigation canals, actively recharges the shallow groundwater system to potentially contaminate the shallow aquifer. N E W M E X I C O B U R E A U O F G E O L O G Y A N D M I N E R A L R E S O U R C E S : O F R 6 1 2 2 Water samples were collected during two time periods, fall of 2018 and spring of 2019. These periods were chosen because they typically capture the extremes of the annual hydrologic regime in this region according to Newton et al., (2017). Over most of the study area, ground- water levels are highest in early fall (September and October) due to irrigation water recharg- ing the aquifer over the previous seven months. Groundwater levels during March and April, just before snowmelt reaches the river, are at their lowest, which correlates to base-flow condi- tions. All groundwater samples were analyzed for major cations and anions, trace metals, and the stable isotopes of oxygen (\u03b418O) and hydrogen (\u03b4D). For a subset of wells, extra samples were collected for the analysis of sulfur and oxygen isotopes in sulfate and carbon isotopes in dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC). Water level data and geochemical results from this study were very similar to those of Newton et al., (2017). Water level data showed groundwater flowing to the southwest and towards the river, resulting in the river gaining water from the aquifer over the entire reach in New Mexico most of the time. In some localized areas, such as the area near Cedar Hill, some water levels in wells appeared to be below river stage in winter months, indicating a change to losing conditions in these specific locations. Historically low discharge rates in the Animas River in 2018 caused water levels in some wells close to the river to drop below water levels observed in past years and in 2019. However, water levels over most of the study area did not appear to be affected, mainly because groundwater levels in the Animas Valley are largely controlled by irrigation. Irrigation water recharges the shallow aquifer by infiltration through fields and irrigation canals, causing water levels to rise. Water then drains back into the river during the winter months, causing water levels to decrease. Similar to previous conclusions of Newton et al., (2017) sulfate and total dissolved solids (TDS) concentrations increase down-gradient (to the southwest), reflecting the apparent mix- ing of fresh river water (irrigation recharge) and at least one high-sulfate, high-TDS regional groundwater component. Stable isotope data for dissolved sulfate was compared to data presented by Nordstrom et al., (2007) which included stable isotopic compositions of sulfate for springs, streams, and rocks in the Upper Animas watershed in Colorado. For groundwater that is chemically similar to river water (fresh water endmember observed in the northern portion of the study area), it appears that sulfate and likely most other dissolved constituents originate from volcanic rocks and alteration minerals in the Animas headwaters in the San Juan Mountains. The conceptual model that describes geologic controlled upwelling of high-sulfate regional groundwater suggested by Newton et al., (2017) was largely confirmed as the primary factor contributing to the spatial distribution of TDS concentrations, sulfate concentrations, and other dissolved constituents. However, this study highlighted some complexities: \u2022 There are likely at least two high-sulfate mixing endmembers characterized as different water types (sodium-sulfate and calcium-sulfate). \u2022 In addition to mixing processes, evaporation, which is an important process in this system, can also increase relative sulfate concentrations as is observed south of Aztec. \u2022 Water chemistry data and the stable isotopic composition of water indicate that although the additional sulfate observed in the southern portion of the study area appears to 3 G R O U N D W A T E R M O N I T O"

While the actual sulfate source for the high-sulfate endmember(s) is unknown, other research- ers have described groundwater from underlying Paleogene and Cretaceous rocks with water chemistry similar to that for groundwater samples that we considered to be mixing endmem- bers in this study. Therefore, the upwelling of regional groundwater from underlying Paleogene rocks as described by Newton et al., (2017) is probably the main mechanism by which the high-sulfate endmember enters the shallow system. Many dissolved metals of concern (both natural and anthropogenic) are present in surface water in the Upper Animas River watershed, which ultimately defines groundwater chemistry in the northern part of the study area. Fortunately, geochemical conditions (pH and redox) result in the precipitation of most of these metals before entering the groundwater system in New Mexico. We detected no evidence of groundwater contamination related to the Gold King Mine spill or legacy acid mine drainage in the San Juan Mountains. Dissolved manganese and iron that is observed to exceed secondary maximum contaminant levels (MCLs) in some areas is likely due to manganese oxides and iron (hydr)oxides that were deposited as sediments that make up the shallow aquifer. Dissolved oxygen (DO), which was measured in each well in the field during sample collection, was analyzed for the purpose of identifying areas where the input of contaminated surface water (river and irrigation water) poses potential risk of contaminating the shallow aquifer. The previous phase of this study demonstrated that large increases in DO in groundwater in some wells was due to the input of oxygenated river water, primarily via irrigation. Subsequent decomposition of organic matter causes DO concentrations to decrease, sometimes completely depleting DO. Therefore, the range of observed DO values in groundwater over time can help to identify areas of temporally discrete recharge events related to irrigation and interactions between the river and the shallow groundwater system. We demonstrate the concept of using multiple DO measurements in wells over time to identify these areas of concern. The DOrange/ DOmax ratio can be a useful tool for assessing the variability of DO concentrations in wells over time. Larger ratios may be indicative of an area where surface water is recharging the aquifer intermittently, mostly related to irrigation practices. By monitoring wells close to the river, ditches, or agricultural fields on a biweekly or monthly timescale, areas of potential risk of contamination by the input of surface water can likely be identified.

Furthermore, it was determined that although the New Mexico reach of Animas River usually gains water from the aquifer there is still potential for wells close to the river in some localized areas to capture river water under certain conditions. The 2017 NMBGMR study also generated questions about redox conditions, specifically related to the spatial distribution and source(s) of iron and manga- nese, the only two metals observed at several locations to exceed the EPA secondary maximum contaminant levels (SMCLs) for drinking water. The lack of evidence of harmful effects of the GKM spill on groundwater quality may have been due to the timing of the 2017 study and the small sample size. Future work suggested from the study included continued monitoring of groundwater quality to assess impacts from the GKM spill and the evaluation of areas that are at risk for potential contamination from the direct input of surface water. Newton et al., (2017) also recommended additional geochemical analyses to assess the occurrence of high manganese and iron concentrations, including the evaluation of redox conditions and solute source identification. This report describes the results of a subsequent NMBGMR study with the following objectives: 1. To continue monitoring groundwater quality in the shallow alluvial aquifer in the Animas Valley of New Mexico for the purpose of identifying groundwater quality impacts due to the GKM spill or legacy acid mine drain- age occurring in the Animas headwaters in Colorado.To confirm or refute general findings of Newton et al., (2017), specifically related to the hydrogeologic conceptual model. 2. To confirm or refute general findings of Newton et al., (2017), specifically related to the hydrogeologic conceptual model. 3. To assess the source of dissolved constituents, such as sulfate, sodium, bicarbonate, manga- nese, and iron in shallow groundwater along the Animas River in New Mexico. 4. To evaluate redox conditions and processes within the shallow aquifer that affect the solubility of metals associated with the GKM spill, including manganese and iron. 5. To identify areas in the Animas Valley where surface water, including the river and irriga- tion canals, actively recharges the shallow groundwater system, posing a potential risk of contaminating the shallow aquifer. For this study, we collected 74 groundwater samples in the fall of 2018 and 57 samples in the spring of 2019, resulting in a much denser well coverage throughout the study area compared to Newton et al.,(2017). All samples were analyzed for major ions, trace metals and the stable isotopes of oxygen and hydrogen. Additional isotopic analyses [\u03b434S and \u03b418O in sulfate, \u03b413C in dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC)] for a subset of samples greatly helped to assess geologic solute sources and hydrogeochemical processes that control groundwater chemistry in the study area. We also used the relationship between dissolved oxygen concentrations and total dissolved solids (TDS), observed by Newton et al., (2017) to identify areas where there is active infiltration of irrigation water recharging the shallow aquifer, posing a potential risk of contamination. While our previous conclusions (Newton et al., 2017) were largely confirmed, the additional data increased our understanding of the system and added many details with respect to identifying actual solute sources and complexities related to local, intermediate, and regional flow paths. Most shallow groundwater at the northern part of the study area chemically resem- bles river water (calcium-bicarbonate water type) due to the dissolution of volcanic rocks and hydrothermal minerals in the Upper Animas watershed in Colorado. Increased sulfate concentrations in groundwater in the down-gradient direction (southwest) is due to the input of water that has resided in underlying sedimentary rocks that lie below the shallow alluvial aquifer. The mixing of these two end-members (river water and high-sulfate regional groundwater) shows a spatial trend indicative of more high-sulfate water entering the shallow system to the southwest. Wells that produce water that is high in iron and manganese do not show a spatial trend due to this mixing process. Therefore it is likely that these high manganese and iron waters are a result of more local processes. We also demonstrate the concept of using multiple dis- solved oxygen (DO) measurements in wells over time to identify areas where the input of contaminated surface water (river and irrigation water) poses potential risk of contaminating the shallow aquifer. 7 G R O U N D W A T E R M O N I T O R I N G A L O N G T H E A N I M A S R I V E R , N M N ewton et al., (2017) analyzed water level and geochemical data from numerous wells for dif- ferent seasonal river flow regimes between January 2016 and June 2017. These data, along with previ- ous geologic and hydrologic studies, were utilized to construct a hydrologic conceptual model that describes groundwater flow paths at different scales, groundwater/surface water interactions, and how these processes change over time. Geochemical data also provided information about potential ground- water contamination related to the GKM spill, legacy acid mine drainage, and other sources.

This section briefly describes the conceptual model and data interpretations by Newton et al., (2017). Geology The Animas River is located on the northwestern margin of the San Juan Basin, which is an asymmetric structural depression in the Colorado Plateau prov- ince. The geology of the area as described by Craigg (2001), consists of terrestrial and marine sedimentary rocks of late Cretaceous to Paleogene age (Figure 2). The Upper Cretaceous rocks include the Dakota Sandstone, Mancos Shale, Lewis Shale, Pictured Cliffs Sandstone, the Fruitland Formation and the Kirtland Shale. While these units are not an important water source in the Animas Valley, many of them serve as aquifers in other areas in the basin (Kelley et al., 2014). Cretaceous sandstone beds and silty to sandy mudstone beds, such as the Dakota, Point Lookout, and Pictured Cliffs Sandstones, are the primary producers of oil and gas in the San Juan Basin (Fassett, 2010). The depth of the Cretaceous rocks along the Animas River varies from several hundreds of feet below the surface Near Durango to zero feet near Farmington, where outcrops of late Cretaceous (~75 Ma) Kirtland Shale are found. Paleogene rocks, including the San Jose and Nacimiento Formations, form the cliffs that bound the Animas Valley and lie directly below the valley-fill that that makes up the shallow alluvial aquifer. Near Durango, along the Animas River (Figure 3), outcrops I I . P R E V I O U S W O R K of the Animas Formation are observed, which is made up of interbedded tuffaceous sandstone, conglomer- ate and shale. In the Cedar Hill region, the nearby surrounding hills/mesas are composed primarily of Eocene (~50\u201355 Ma) San Jose Formation and Paleocene (~60\u201365 Ma) Nacimiento Formation. The San Jose is an interbedded, very fine to coarse-grained arkosic sandstone. The Nacimiento Formation consists of interbedded gray shale, and discontinu- ous lenses of sandstone and interfingers with the Paleocene Ojo Alamo Sandstone, which consists of arkosic sandstone and conglomerate. The Ojo Alamo Formation outcrops just north of Farmington, New Mexico. While these Cenozoic rocks are important aquifers in other parts of the San Juan Basin in Colorado and New Mexico (Kelley et al., 2014; Robson and Winfield, 1995) there are very few water wells in the Animas Valley that are completed in these units. There are no known major structural features (i.e. faults or folds) along the river corridor. The Animas River from the Colorado\u2013New Mexico border flows through Quaternary alluvial deposits, which make up the shallow alluvial aquifer. The Quaternary alluvium is largely made up of sediment eroded from Paleogene rocks into which the Animas River has incised. While municipal or regional drinking water is largely sourced from the Animas River, most private domestic wells in the valley rely on the alluvial aquifer, with well depths of about 30 to 60 feet. Hydrology Animas River The headwaters of the Animas River originate high in the San Juan Mountains, in the Silverton Mining District. The main tributaries that contribute to the Animas in Colorado include Cement Creek and Mineral Creek near the headwaters, numerous small streams in Animas Canyon between Silverton and Durango, and the Florida River just north of the New Mexico\u2013Colorado border.

The spring runoff peak shown in Figure 4 for 2018 occurred in early May with discharge rates less than 2000 cfs. The Center for Snow and Avalanche Studies (CSAS) reported that cumulative flow in the Animas River during the 2018 snowmelt season (March 1 through June 30) was 33% of the median (CSAS, 2018). Average daily discharge in 2019 was much higher, with a more typical spring runoff peak discharge and timing. Groundwater Levels\u2014In general, groundwater flows parallel to the river (northeast to southwest) and discharges into the river. Groundwater levels in the shallow alluvial aquifer throughout much of the Animas Valley in New Mexico are strongly linked to irrigation practices and seasonal river stage fluctua- tions (Newton et al., 2017). Figure 5 shows the range of seasonal fluctuations observed in different wells in 2016. To better understand the hydrodynamics of the alluvial aquifer, Newton et al. (2017) classified the wells with sufficient temporal measurement density (three or more water level measurements per Figure 5. Seasonal groundwater level fluctuations in wells completed in the shallow alluvial aquifer in the Animas Valley observed in 2016 (Newton et al., 2017). Figure 4.

Water levels typically remain elevated in these wells until the end of the irrigation season, when the ditches are shut off. At this point, there is a sharp drop in water levels as the ditches are no longer supplying water to the alluvial aquifer, and groundwater discharges to the river. The declining leg of these hydrographs begins flattening as the water level appears to approach equilibrium before the irrigation season begins again. The irrigation season is important both for the economy of the area and the recharge of the alluvial aquifer. The return ground- water flow from irrigated land and the water lost through the base of the irrigation ditches supports the water table. This in turn contributes to gaining river conditions seen throughout the valley. Water levels in several wells (22 of 70) in close proximity to the river (<350 ft) more closely correlate with river stage (Figure 6B), reflecting the hydraulic connection between the aquifer and the river. Water levels begin increasing in early May, correlating with river flows being fed by snowmelt in the mountains. Peak water levels in these wells are usually reached by the end of May or early June. As mentioned above, the Animas River, within New Mexico, is generally characterized as a gaining river, where groundwater discharges to the river. The river certainly gains water from the aquifer along the NM reach during irrigation season while ground- water levels are high. However, during base-flow conditions (January\u2014March), when river stage and groundwater levels are at their lowest, Newton et al. (2017) observed localized areas where the hydraulic gradient between the river and the aquifer decreased significantly and sometimes reversed to where the river was likely losing water to the groundwater system. The two areas where this apparent gradient reversal was observed were near Cedar Hill and the area labeled Inca in Figure 5. These apparent gradient reversals have implications for potential contamina- tion of the groundwater. Groundwater Chemistry\u2014Newton et al. (2017) sampled thirty-one wells in the study area (Figure 7), most of them being sampled multiple times during different river flow regimes between January 2016 and June 2017. All samples were analyzed for major cations and anions, trace metals, and the stable isotopes of oxygen and hydrogen. Figure 8 shows groundwater chemistry data plotted on a Piper diagram and the spatial distribution for the different water types. Most groundwater sampled north of Aztec exhibits a calcium-bicarbonate water type, indicative of the dissolution of calcite or limestone. Total dissolved solids (TDS) concentrations for these waters are well below 1,000 mg/L. As groundwater flows down-gradient towards the southwest, sulfate and TDS concentrations increase significantly, with many TDS concentrations exceeding 1,000 mg/L. This increase in sulfate and TDS concentrations is espe- cially evident south of Aztec.

Newton et al. (2017) suggested that this apparent mixing was due to the upwelling of high-total dissolved solids, sulfate-rich regional groundwater as a result of the thinning of the Nacimiento and Ojo Alamo Formations as shown in Figure 9. While this mixing model explained the observed distribution of many of the major ions, observed concentrations for other dissolved constituents, such as sodium, chloride, and bicarbonate, did not fit the mixing model as well, and therefore indicated a more complex system. Over all, this interpretation of water chemistry data is consistent with the water level data described above. The primary source of irrigation water is the Animas River which is diverted and delivered to fields through a series of irrigation canals. Figure 10 shows continuous water level and specific conductance (SC, used as a proxy for TDS concentrations) data for four different wells and an irrigation ditch that show direct evidence of irrigation water recharging the alluvial aquifer. The initiation of irrigation, indicated by the instantaneous filling of the irrigation ditch, coincides with increases in groundwater levels and decreases in specific conductance due to the mixing of fresher surface water and more concentrated groundwater.

Continuous water level and specific conductance data in four wells and an irrigation ditch. In general, there is an inverse correlation between specific conductance and water levels in the wells. The instantaneous decreases (vertical lines) in water level and specific conductance are caused by pumping.

These high iron and manganese concentrations appear to be associated with Eh values less than 200 millivolts (Newton et al., 2017), and although the primary recharge source, which is river water via irrigation, is well oxygenated, measured Eh values and the ubiquitous presence of dissolved manganese indicates that dissolved oxygen is consumed quickly, resulting in manganese oxides and iron hydroxides being the main redox buffers. It is difficult to determine the source of the iron and manganese. This study aimed to assess redox conditions in the shallow aquifer to better evaluate iron and manganese sources. Figure 11.

The goal was to collect water samples that were chemically representative of local groundwater from existing domestic and irrigation wells that were equipped with pumps. Most of these wells are used regularly, and therefore well bore water is mobile and likely does not reside in the well casing long enough for the chemical composition of the water to change significantly. However, we still took extra precautions to ensure the integrity of the water sample. General water sampling procedures include purging the well until field parameters [pH, dissolved oxygen, specific conductivity, oxidation-reduction potential (ORP), and temperature], which are being monitored in real time, stabilize before collecting the sample. In order to prevent contamination of the samples from external sources and cross- contamination from other samples, we followed a strict sampling protocol (Appendix D). All sampling equipment was cleaned using laboratory soap and rinsed with deionized water immediately prior to each sampling event and at the end of each day during the sampling event. A separate clean sampling manifold and tubing was used for each well and Nitrile gloves were worn during the sampling procedure. Water samples were collected during two time periods, fall of 2018 (September 24\u2013October 11, 74 samples) and spring of 2019 (April 1\u201310, 54 samples) (Figure 12a, b, and c). These periods were chosen because they typically capture the extremes of the annual hydrologic regime in this region according to Newton et al., (2017). Over most of the study area, groundwater levels are highest in early fall (September and October) due to irrigation water recharging the aquifer over the previous seven months. Groundwater levels during March and April, just before snowmelt reaches the river, are at their lowest, which correlates to base-flow conditions. Newton et al., (2017) noted some differences in water chemistry that correlated with seasonal changes in the hydrologic regime. I I I . M E T H O D S Information about all water sampling sites is avail- able in Appendix A. Table 1 lists well locations, approximate total depths, sample events during which each well was sampled, and the figure that shows each well location. All wells sampled for this study, except AR-0217 were private domestic and irrigation wells completed in the shallow alluvial aquifer in the Animas Valley. The well AR-0217 (Figure 12c) is located north of Farmington, outside of the river valley and is likely completed in the Nacimiento Formation at around 339 feet bgs. This well was included in this study with a goal of sampling regional groundwater. All groundwater samples were analyzed for major cations and anions, trace metals, and the stable iso- topes of oxygen (\u03b418O) and hydrogen (\u03b4D). In addi- tion, for the fall 2018 sampling event only, samples were analyzed for dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and total organic carbon (TOC). For a subset of wells (21 samples for fall 2018, 18 samples for spring 2019, Figure 13), additional samples were collected for the analysis of sulfur and oxygen isotopes in sulfate and carbon isotopes in dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC). For trace metals and major cations, total and dis- solved concentrations were determined. Water to be analyzed for dissolved trace metals and cations was filtered (0.45 micron filters) and acidified with nitric acid in the field. Water samples to be analyzed for total trace metals and cations were also acidified but were not filtered so that any constituents of interest that were adsorbed to colloids and small particulates would be included in the analysis. Analyses for trace metals, major ions and stable isotopes of oxygen and hydrogen were performed at the Chemistry Lab at New Mexico Bureau of Geology and Mineral Resources. Samples to be analyzed for sulfur and oxygen isotopes in sulfate and carbon isotopes in DIC were sent to the Center for Stable Isotopes at the University of New Mexico, in Albuquerque, NM. Samples to be analyzed for DOC and TOC were sent to Hall Environmental Analysis Laboratory in Albuquerque, NM.

Groundwater Levels When possible, we measured the water level in wells before collecting a sample.

If water level measurements were not repeatable within 0.02 feet, notes were made and entered into the database, suggesting that these measurements were of lower data quality. This may happen for various reasons, such as when the well is pumping, recovering, or a nearby site is being pumped. The goal is to obtain a static water level measurement which is confirmed by a repeatable measurement within 0.02 ft. All manual ground- water level measurements are found in Appendix B. Water level data from pressure transducers with data recorders are available from the New Mexico Bureau of Geology and Mineral Resources upon request. Continuous Data Recorders We use the term \u201ccontinuous\u201d to refer to data that were collected at regular time intervals by instru- ments installed in the field. For this study, most continuous data were collected hourly. Continuous measurements of pressure and temperature were recorded using Van Essen \u201cDivers\u201d and \u201cBaros\u201d to measure and record pressure data in wells and the atmosphere respectively. We processed these data using software provided by Van Essen, which subtracts atmospheric pressure from total pressure measured in the wells and accounts for water tem- perature to convert pressure readings to water head that is equal to the depth of water above the pressure transducer. These continuous water level data were then adjusted based on manual water level measurements that were done at the time of the download. These adjustments that are based on the difference between the manual water level measure- ment and the corresponding instrument measurement (recorded at the time closest to that of the manual measurement) were applied to continuous water level data going backward in time, to the previous site download/measurement. A subset of these data recorders (CTD Divers) measured specific conductance in addition to tem- perature and pressure. Throughout the duration of this study, the factory calibrated instruments yielded specific conductance measurements within 5% of measurements made independently in the field with instruments that had been recently calibrated against known standards. Therefore the recalibration of the CTD Divers was not necessary. Figure 14 shows locations of the wells where these instruments were installed and the time period for each dataset. 25 G R O U N D W A T E R M O N I T O R I N G A L O N G T H E A N I M A S R I V E R , N M T his section presents data collected for this study. Data interpretation is presented in the Discussion section. Manual water level measurements and water chemistry data are provided in Appendix B and Appendix C respectively. Groundwater Levels Depth to water data is shown below on Table 2 and Figure 15. With the exception of AR-0217, which is a deep well located outside the river valley, depth to water throughout the Animas Valley is relatively shallow. Depth to water ranged from 0.24 to 53.73 and 2.15 to 56.72 feet bgs for fall, 2018 and spring, 2019 sampling events respectively. For most wells, the water table was observed to be deeper in the spring, I V . R E S U L T S 2019 than six months earlier. In general the depth to water decreases with proximity of the river (Figure 15). However in some areas, the depth to water appears to be highly variable among wells in close proximity to each other. Figure 16 and Figure 17 show hydrographs for wells AR-0116 and AR-0007, which were identified as irrigation-controlled and river stage-controlled wells respectively by Newton et al., (2017). Water level fluctuations in AR-0116 correlate with the timing of irrigation, quickly increasing in response to the initia- tion of flow in the irrigation ditch and then gradually decreasing after flow in the ditch has stopped. In 2018, decreased water levels in the ditch were observed with no apparent influence on groundwater levels. Water level data for the well AR-0007, which correlate to fluctuations in river stage, showed a slight Table 2. Depth to water data for fall 2018 and spring 2019 sample events. The calculated difference for wells that were measured for both sampling events is the result of subtracting the 2018 measurement from the 2019 measurement. ft bgs = feet below ground surface, NA = Not Applicable, the water level in the well was not measured. **Water level measurements for well AR-0217, which is located outside the river valley, are not included in the statistics provided below.

An exception to this trend is the well AR-0187, located in the northern portion of the study area near Cedar Hill (Figure 12A). AR-0187 showed the highest sulfate concentrations of 1,630 and 1,160 mg/L for fall, 2018 and spring 2019 respectively. The deep well, AR-0217, produced water with a TDS concentration of 1,520 mg/L, a sulfate concentration of 830 mg/L, and was characterized as a calcium-bicarbonate water type. decrease in 2018 compared to previous years due to extremely low river discharge that year.

Major cation concentrations for samples collected in the fall 2018. All concentrations are presented as mg/L. The Piper diagram shown in Figure 19, which shows all data for samples collected for this study, exhibits a linear trend for major anions that shows that most groundwater sampled can be character- ized with the dominant anion being bicarbonate or sulfate. All water samples had low relative chloride concentrations (<25% as a proportion of total anions in meq/L). For cations, most samples plot in a cluster with calcium as the dominant cation with a few samples exhibiting higher relative concentrations of sodium. Most water samples can be categorized as calcium-bicarbonate and calcium-sulfate water types. Figure 20 shows total dissolved solids concentra- tions as a function of relative sulfate concentrations (as a proportion of total anions in milliequivalents per liter). We observed a rough exponential relation- ship with total dissolved solids increasing as sulfate becomes the dominant anion. Alkalinity and pH were examined because these parameters often affect concentrations of dissolved constituents. A rough inverse relationship between alkalinity and pH was observed (Figure 21), and the majority of pH values measured during the fall of 2018 were lower than those measured in the spring of 2019 (Figure 22). The six wells that exhibit the lowest pH values measured for the 2018 sampling event, which include AR-0229, AR-0115, AR-0173, AR-0236, AR-0102, and AR-0110, are all located in the northern portion of the study area (Figure 12A).

We observed a large range in dissolved oxygen concentrations for each sampling event. Comparing dissolved oxygen measurements in wells sampled in both 2018 and 2019 show that concentrations can vary quite a lot over time (Figure 23). In some wells, dissolved oxygen values measured at the different times were nearly identical, while in other wells dissolved oxygen concentrations changed significantly between sampling events. Interestingly, Dissolved oxygen concentrations appear to be gener- ally lower south of Aztec. Trace metals and redox conditions We analyzed water samples for the following trace metals: silver (Ag), aluminum (Al), arsenic (As), boron (B), barium (Ba), beryllium (Be), cadmium (Cd), cobalt (Co), chromium (Cr), copper (Cu), iron (Fe), mercury (Hg), lithium (Li), manganese (Mn), molybdenum (Mo), nickel (Ni), lead (Pb), antimony (Sb), selenium (Se), tin (Sn), strontium (Sr), thorium (Th), titanium (Ti), uranium (U), vanadium (V), and zinc (Zn). For most of these metals, analysis results were below the reporting limit for nearly all the samples. All water samples exhibited concentrations below the maximum contaminant levels (MCLs) as defined by the EPA National Primary Drinking Water Regulations that Figure 19.

For AR-0115, located near Cedar Hill (Figure 27), the sample collected during the fall of 2018 exhibited a total alu- minum concentration of 0.0008 mg/L, and dissolved aluminum was below the detection limit. In 2019, there was still no measurable dissolved aluminum, but total aluminum was slightly above the 0.05 SMCL at 0.063 mg/L. There was an even larger contrast observed for well AR-0003, located near Flora Vista (Figure 28). In 2018, total aluminum was 0.69 mg/L, well above the SMCL, and dissolved aluminum was 0.0013 mg/L. In the spring of 2019, total aluminum was 0.0083 mg/L. For many metals in groundwater, whether they are present in the dissolved or solid phase depends on the Eh and pH. A plot of Eh versus pH (Figure 29) shows a rough inverse correlation. Samples collected in the fall of 2018 that exhibit the lowest pH values (pH <6.3) plot at the high end for Eh (300\u2013500 mV). However, many samples with higher pH values also exhibit similar Eh values. With a few exceptions, water samples with Eh measurements less than 200 mV tend to have higher iron and manganese concentrations (Figure 30). To assess the temporal variability for Eh and dissolved manganese and iron concentrations, we calculated the ratio of 2018 measurements/2019 measurements for wells sampled both in the fall of 2018 and the spring of 2019. For dissolved iron and manganese, the majority of wells showed ratios less than one, indicating that concen- trations were higher in spring 2019. Conversely, for Eh, the majority of wells showed a ratio greater than one, indicating that Eh values were generally higher in the fall of 2018. Stable isotopes of hydrogen and oxygen The stable isotopes of oxygen and hydrogen are useful tools for tracing the hydrologic cycle. The isotopic composition of a water sample refers to the ratio of the heavier isotopes to the lighter isotopes (R) for the hydrogen and oxygen that make up the water molecules. Because these stable isotopes are part of the water molecule, small variations in these ratios act as labels that allow tracking of waters with different stable isotopic signatures. All isotopic compositions in this report are presented as relative concentrations, or the per mil deviation of R of a sample from R of a standard (VSMOW) shown in the equation below: were established to protect against consumption of drinking water contaminants that present a risk to human health. Manganese, iron, and aluminum are the only trace metals that were observed in some wells to exceed secondary maximum contaminant levels (SMCLs) (https://www.epa.gov/sdwa/secondary- drinking-water-standards-guidance-nuisance-chemi- cals) as defined by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency secondary drinking water regulation, which is a non-enforceable guideline regarding cosmetic or aesthetic effects. While these contaminants are not health threatening, if present at levels above the SMCLs, these constituents may cause the water to appear cloudy or colored, or to taste or smell bad. Figure 25, Figure 26, and Figure 27 shows the spatial distribution for total manganese, total iron, and total aluminum concentrations, respectively, for water samples that exhibited concentrations that exceed the SMCLs. As stated previously, samples ana- lyzed for total concentrations were not filtered and samples analyzed for dissolved concentrations were filtered through a 0.45-micron filter. For this discus- sion, total concentrations are used because they are more representative of the water that well owners are consuming. No clear spatial trend was observed for total manganese and total iron concentrations. Both dissolved and total concentrations for manganese and iron were detected in the majority of the water samples collected (Table 5). Figure 28 shows the total concentration as a function of dissolved concentration for manganese and iron. For almost all the samples, total and dissolved manganese concentrations were almost identical, indicating that most manganese is in the dissolved phase. For iron, many samples exhibit significantly higher total concentrations, indicating that iron is often present as iron oxides/hydroxides. Total aluminum was detected in 99 and 96 percent of the samples collected in 2018 and 2019 respectively, while dissolved aluminum was detected in 74 and 53 percent of samples.

Isotopic characterization of local precipitation is often very useful for identifying groundwater recharge sources and mechanisms. Newton et al., (2017) estimated a local meteoric water line (LMWL) (Figure 32) based on the isotopic composition of Animas River samples collected in several areas from the headwaters to the confluence of Animas and San Juan rivers. The isotopic compositions of river water defined an evaporation line that showed a larger degree of evaporation for samples collected farther downstream. Therefore the isotopic composition of river water at the headwaters of the Animas near Cement Creek were assumed to show no evaporation and to plot on the LMWL. Assuming a slope of 8, the estimated LMWL was characterized with a deuterium excess of 17. Nordstrom et al., (2007) described the Rocky Mountain meteoric water line (RMMWL), which has a slope of 8.1 and a deuterium excess of 14.8. Figure 32 shows the isotopic composition of groundwater samples collected in the fall of 2018 and the spring of 2019. The isotopic composition of AR-0213 (Newton et al., 2017) is also included. Both datasets (fall 2018 and spring 2019) plot roughly along two apparent evaporation lines with similar slopes, 5.5 and 5.8 for the fall and spring sampling events respectively.

Stable isotopic composition of dissolved sulfate We analyzed a subset of samples for the stable isotopes of sulfur (\u03b434S) and oxygen (\u03b418O) in dissolved sulfate to assess sulfate sources in the shallow aquifer in the Animas Valley. The stable sulfur isotopic values for groundwater in the Animas Valley ranged from -12.3 to 9.2\u2030, with the lighter values (\u03b434S <0) located south of Aztec (Figure 34). Stable oxygen isotopic composi- tions in sulfate (only analyzed for samples collected in 2018) ranged from -2.8 to 4.8\u2030 and also show the lightest values to the south of Aztec (Figure 35). The water sample from AR-0217 exhibits the lightest \u03b434S and \u03b418O values, and interestingly, the sample collected from AR-0187 exhibits a slightly lighter sulfur isotopic value than other wells in the area. Figure 36 shows \u03b434S as a function of \u03b418O. Wells producing water with the lightest sulfate stable isotopic compositions are located south of Aztec. These data and their implica- tions for solute source identification is discussed in detail in the Discussion section below. Figure 33.

Figure 37 shows the spatial distribution for \u03b413C values for water samples collected in the fall of 2018 and spring of 2019. While there is no obvious trend, it should be noted that the lightest values are observed in the southernmost portion of the study area. Carbon iso- topes in DIC show a rough linear inverse correlation with dissolved bicarbonate concentrations (Figure 38), which range from 186 to 429 mg/L. Most water samples that show an apparent decrease in \u03b413C (DIC) are near saturated or over-saturated with respect to calcite (Figure 38).

An increase in the depth to water in 2018, compared to previous years, suggests that water levels in wells controlled by stage of the river are affected by extreme changes in river discharge. Groundwater level data for both sampling events were contoured (Figure 38 and Figure 39) to assess groundwater flow directions groundwater/surface water interactions and show similar characteristics to water table contours constructed by Newton et al., (2017). Groundwater generally flows parallel and towards the river, indicating gaining conditions along most of the NM reach. Water table contours for 2018 (Figure 38) and 2019 (Figure 39) look remarkably similar even with the historically low river discharge rates in 2018. With the number of data points used, there are no significant differences in groundwater flow conditions observed in the fall of 2018 and spring 2019. However, in localized regions in the northern portion of the study area, we observed water levels in some wells that appeared to be below adjacent river stage elevation (denoted by red points in Figure 38 and Figure 39), indicating a possible reversal in the hydraulic gradient between the river and the aquifer. This apparent localized reversal in gradient, which was also observed by Newton et al., (2017), was primarily observed in the spring of 2019 during base flow conditions and have implications for potential groundwater contamination due to the input of contaminated river water. Geochemical Controls on Water Chemistry Water chemistry data presented above provides evidence for important geochemical processes that control major ion chemistry of shallow groundwater in the Animas Valley. General chemistry analyses for samples collected in 2018 and 2019 exhibited similar ranges in concentrations and similar spatial distribu- tions to that observed by Newton et al., (2017). Sulfate and TDS concentrations in groundwater appear to significantly increase down gradient, to the south and west, with the highest sulfate concentra- tions observed south of Aztec (Figure 18). In this section we discuss different geochemical processes that control the groundwater chemistry, resulting in the observed spatial and temporal trends. Evaporation and mixing processes The stable isotopic compositions (\u03b418O and \u03b4D) of water samples collected for this study show clear evidence that most water sampled has under gone some degree of evaporation. Isotopic compositions for all water samples collected in the fall of 2018 and spring of 2019 plot along two different but similar apparent evaporation lines (Figure 32).

While there is significant scatter in the data, most data follows a general direct correlation where both the chloride concentration and the isotopic composition increase due to evaporation. Samples collected from AR-0217 exhibited a heavy isotopic composition (Figure 32) that plots near the GMWL, probably representing a modern mixture of local winter and summer precipitation. Data points for AR-0217 in Figure 41 are outliers in the chloride-\u03b4D evaporation trend, with relatively low chloride concentrations and heavy isotopic values, suggesting water from this well is not affected by evaporation and likely represents a different water source. Water from AR-0187 stands out as the most evaporated water on both evaporation lines in Figure 32 and on the evaporation trend seen in Figure 41. Geochemical trends also indicate the mixing of different water sources. The linear trend between bicarbonate-dominant and sulfate-dominant water on the anion portion of the Piper diagram (Figure 19) is likely due to the mixing of two or more water sources. Relative cation concentrations may also show a mixing trend between calcium-dominant water and sodium-dominant water, but these data are also likely affected by cation exchange processes where aqueous calcium and magnesium are exchanged with adsorbed sodium on sediments. While there is no doubt that almost all water sampled has undergone cation exchange to some degree (Newton et al., 2017), for the following discussion, we assume that the extent of cation exchange that the different mix- ing endmembers have undergone remains constant. The distribution of data in the diamond portion of the Piper diagram in Figure 19 is likely due to mixing of three or more endmembers, a freshwater endmem- ber and two or more high-sulfate endmembers. The following discussion examines the mixing relation- ships between different apparent endmembers from several different perspectives. The freshwater endmember, which is not rep- resented by water from a single well, is chemically similar to river water, characterized as calcium- bicarbonate water type with relative sulfate concen- trations between 0.3 and 0.4 and TDS concentrations between 300 and 700 mg/L. Wells that produce water samples considered as possible high-sulfate mixing endmembers include AR-0213 (Newton et al., 2017), AR-0217, and AR- 0019. Newton et al., (2017) sampled the well AR-0213, which is completed in a bedrock aquifer just outside the river valley with a Figure 41. Chloride as a function of deuterium isotopic composition. The rough direct correlation between chloride and \u03b4D values is due to evapora- tion.

This water sample stood out as an endmember with respect to water type (Figure 19), TDS, sulfate concentrations, isotopic composition (Figure 32), and age. AR-0213 produced a sodium-sulfate water type with the highest TDS and sulfate concentrations of 10,000 mg/L and 6,320 mg/L (relative sulfate concentration of 0.93) respectively. Water from AR-0213 exhibited with very light \u03b418O and \u03b4D values, representative of very old water that originated as precipitation in the Pleistocene (Phillips et al., 1989). Also, this water sample exhibited an apparent carbon-14 age of about 20,000 years before present. Carbon-14 data was not corrected for hydro- geochemical processes such as the dissolution of calcite or limestone. The deepest well sampled for this study (total depth ~ 340 feet bgs), AR-0217, which is also located outside the river valley, produced calcium-sul- fate water with a relatively high TDS concentration of about 1,500 mg/L and a sulfate concentration of about 830 mg/L (relative sulfate concentration of 0.74). As mentioned above, stable isotope data suggests that this water is likely modern local precipitation (plots near GMWL) and does not show evidence of evapora- tion, as seen for most other water samples. The well, AR-0019 (Figure 12b) also stood out by producing water with relatively high TDS concentrations of 2,150 and 2,190 mg/L and sulfate concentrations of 1,330 and 1,380 mg/L (relative sulfate concentrations of 0.87 and 0.91) for samples collected in the fall of 2018 and the spring of 2019 respectively. Water from AR-0019 does not stand out isotopically, plotting along the observed evaporation trends. AR-0019 water is characterized as a calcium-sulfate water type and plots at the top of the diamond portion of the Piper diagram (Figure 19). While the well AR-0187 is not necessarily considered to represent a mixing endmember, this well stood out as the only well north of Aztec that produced high-sulfate water. Water from AR-0187, located near Cedar Hill (Figure 12a), is characterized as sodium-sulfate water and exhibited the highest TDS and sulfate concentrations of 2,900 mg/L and 1,630 mg/L (approximate relative sulfate concentration of 0.75) respectively. A three-endmember mixing relationship is seen when sodium/chloride molar ratios are plotted as a function of relative sulfate concentrations (Figure 42).

A three-endmember mixing relationship is seen when sodium/chloride molar ratios are plotted as a function of relative sulfate concentrations (Figure 42). The two high-sulfate endmembers are differentiated by the sodium/chloride ratios, with water from AR-0213 having the highest sodium/chloride ratio. Water from AR-0217appears to be mostly a mixture between the freshwater endmember and AR-0213. Figure 43 shows modeled mixing lines between three endmembers that are defined by \u03b4D and the sodium/chloride molar ratio. The fresh water (river or irrigation water) endmember has a \u03b4D value of about -106 \u2030 and the lowest sodium/chloride ratio. The sodium-sulfate high-TDS water (AR-0213) is characterized by a very light isotopic composition and the highest sodium/ chloride ratio. AR-0019 exhibits an intermediate isotopic composition and sodium/chloride ratio. The size of the data points on Figure 43 are proportional to the relative sulfate concentration (as a proportion of total anions in meq/L). A water sample that is purely a mixture of two of the endmembers will plot on the appropriate mixing line. Evaporation results in an increase in the \u03b4D value but does not affect the Na/Cl ratio. Therefore, the combination of mixing and evaporation will result in the data point plotting between the two endmembers but above the mixing line. We can see then that the combination of evaporation and mixing of the fresh water and the calcium-sulfate water (AR-0019) can explain almost all the data. However, the relative sulfate concentra- tions suggest that many of the water samples that plot between the fresh water endmember and AR-0019 exhibit relative sulfate concentrations that are too small for that mixing ratio. Therefore it is likely that some of that sulfate is derived from mixing with water similar in composition to AR-0213. With the exception of AR-0217, water samples with the highest \u03b4D values (AR-0031, AR-0187 and others), plot at the far end of the evaporation lines in Figure 32 and show significantly higher relative sulfate concentra- tions. This relationship indicates that evaporation can also increase the relative sulfate concentration. Therefore, the observed increase in sulfate concentra- tions along the groundwater flow path is a result of mixing and evaporation. Figure 44, which shows \u03b4D plotted as a function of relative sulfate concentration, shows the same mixing relationships as shown in Figure 43 and similarly, shows that evaporation does indeed increase the relative sulfate concentration. In contrast from the mixing relationships seen in Figure 42, Figure 43 and Figure 44 indicate that water from AR-0217 is not an endmember or a result of these mixing and evaporative processes. The difference between these mixing relationships shown in Figure 42 and those shown in Figure 43 and Figure 44 is related to constituents being used to define endmembers. In Figure 42, both the sodium/chloride molar ratio and the relative sulfate concentration are related to the solute source, while the stable isotopic composition of water (\u03b4D), used to define mixing relationships in Figure 43 and Figure 44 is related to the water source (the precipitation in the recharge area during the time of recharge).

It is also possible that there is more than one sulfate source that is contribut- ing to dissolved constituents in the shallow alluvial aquifer. These mixing relationships are examined in more detail below with the stable isotopes of sulfate and DIC with implications for solute source determination. Identification of solute sources From the discussion above, it is clear that the observed change in groundwater chemistry within the shallow aquifer is primarily due to evaporation and mixing. Groundwater at the New Mexico/Colorado border is characterized as calcium-bicarbonate water type with TDS concentrations between 500 and 800 milligrams per liter. TDS and sulfate concentrations increase down-gradient (towards the southwest) along groundwater flow paths and is particularly pronounced in wells south of Aztec with TDS and sulfate concentrations as high as 2,740 and 1,590 milligrams per liter respectively. In this section we examine major ion chemistry and isotopic composi- tions of sulfate and DIC to determine the geologic solute sources for 1) groundwater at the northern extent of the of the study area (NM state line), which is referred to as the fresh-water endmember and 2) the groundwater source(s) entering the shallow system and increasing TDS and sulfate concentrations along groundwater flow paths, referred to as the high-sulfate endmember(s). The following discussion is largely considered under the framework of the conceptual model presented by Newton et al., (2017) (Figure 9), where the high-sulfate endmember is moving into the shallow system from a deeper aquifer system. The stable isotopic compositions of sulfate and DIC can help to more accurately identify which aquifer that may be. Stable isotopic compositions of sulfate\u2014The spatial distribution of \u03b434S (sulfate) (Figure 34) and \u03b418O (sulfate) (Figure 35), where isotopic compositions decrease in the down-gradient direction, suggests that sources of sulfate in the fresh-water endmember and the high-sulfate endmember(s) have different and distinct isotopic signatures. However, as in seen in Figure 47, while water from AR-0217 does exhibit a \u03b434S value that is much lighter than those for water with lower relative sulfate concentrations, there are several wells that produce water with high relative sulfate concentrations (>0.5) and heavier \u03b434S values. As discussed above, evaporation does cause the relative sulfate concentration to increase, likely due to a decrease in alkalinity caused by the resulting calcite precipitation. It appears that evapora- tion can cause the relative sulfate concentration to increase significantly if we assume that the observed increased \u03b4D values in Figure 44 is primarily due to evaporation. Therefore, the increase in relative sulfate concentrations for waters with heavier sulfate isotopic compositions may be primarily due to evaporation. An alternative explanation would be the mixing with a high-sulfate water with a sulfate isotopic composi- tion similar to that of the fresh water endmember, which may be represented by AR-0004. This well, which is located just north of Aztec (Figure 12b), does exhibit high TDS and sulfate concentrations (2,100 and 1,230 mg/L respectively) but did not really stand out as a possible mixing endmember. Unfortunately, we do not know the sulfate isotopic composition for water from AR-0213 or AR-0019. These data would likely help to determine the processes that result in high relative sulfate concentrations and heavy isotopic compositions. Sulfur and oxygen isotope data for dissolved sul- fate were compared to values measured by Nordstrom et al., (2007) for streams, springs, mines, and minerals in the Upper Animas River Basin above Silverton, Colorado (Figure 48). Isotope values in all shallow groundwater samples collected for this study north of Aztec and some samples collected south of Aztec look similar to those for springs and streams in the Upper Animas watershed with a slight shift in \u03b418O towards heavier values. The four labeled points for samples collected south of Aztec plot with lighter isotopic val- ues along an apparent mixing line, with AR-0217 as the endmember. While we are uncertain of the cause for the apparent small shift in \u03b418O values relative to those for springs in the Upper Animas watershed, the sulfate isotopic compositions of groundwater north of Aztec suggests that the sulfate source for the fresh water endmember is likely pyrite and other sulfides, and hypogenic gypsum and anhydrite in the Animas River headwaters in the San Juan Mountains.

Isotope values in all shallow groundwater samples collected for this study north of Aztec and some samples collected south of Aztec look similar to those for springs and streams in the Upper Animas watershed with a slight shift in \u03b418O towards heavier values. The four labeled points for samples collected south of Aztec plot with lighter isotopic val- ues along an apparent mixing line, with AR-0217 as the endmember. While we are uncertain of the cause for the apparent small shift in \u03b418O values relative to those for springs in the Upper Animas watershed, the sulfate isotopic compositions of groundwater north of Aztec suggests that the sulfate source for the fresh water endmember is likely pyrite and other sulfides, and hypogenic gypsum and anhydrite in the Animas River headwaters in the San Juan Mountains. Sulfate stable isotope data indicates that the sulfate source for the high-sulfate mixing endmember (AR-0217) is characterized by a distinct isotopic signature that is significantly lighter (for both \u03b434S and \u03b418O) than that observed for the fresh water endmember.

The range of observed values for \u03b434S and \u03b418O in dissolved sulfate for different types of rocks (Seal, 2006; Vitoria et al., 2004) can be used to identify the sulfate sources. However, before we determine the solute source based on the isotopic composition of sulfate in water from AR-0217, we will examine stoichiometric relationships in an effort to identify the mineral from which sulfur is derived. Figure 47 shows calcium/sulfate and calcium/ bicarbonate ratios as a function of relative sulfate con- centrations. Calcium concentrations used to calculate these ratios were corrected for cation exchange, using the sodium excess values and the observed calcium/ magnesium ratios. The relative sulfate concentrations indicates the degree of mixing along the flow path. As sulfate becomes the dominant anion which is observed to occur along the general flow path to the southwest, calcium/sulfate ratios transition from 0.5 (indicative of the dissolution of calcite) to a ratio of one, indicating that gypsum is very likely the source of sulfate in regional groundwater that mixes with shallow ground- water, significantly impacting groundwater quality. The possible high-sulfate endmember, AR-0019 is characterized as a calcium-sulfate water type, which is indicative of gypsum dissolution. Water from AR-0213 is chemically similar to water from the Nacimiento Formation in the San Juan Basin, south of the San Juan River, described by Phillips et al., (1986, 1989), including the anomalously light isotopic composition and old carbon-14 age. This water was characterized by high pH, alkalinity, sulfate, and sodium, and extremely low calcium and magnesium concentrations. While they considered that the sulfate source may be the oxidation of sulfide minerals, they concluded that it was much more likely that dissolution of gypsum and cation exchange were the important geochemical processes that affected the water chemistry, providing more evidence that gypsum is likely the source of sulfate that is being added to the shallow aquifer system particularly in the southern portion of the study area (south of Aztec). Gypsum is a very common mineral that exists in evaporites from the evaporation of lakes and sea water, and it is also commonly deposited in veins in hydrothermal systems. The stable isotopic composi- tion of sulfate in gypsum is usually much heavier than that observed for AR-0217. Hypogenic gypsum found in the Upper Animas water shed exhibits \u03b434S values between fifteen and twenty per mil (Figure 46), and in general, gypsum in marine evaporites exhibit Figure 48.

Vitoria et al., 2004 shows the range of \u03b434S values for terrestrial evapo- rates to be between -13 and 10 per mil, but it is very rare to find these more negative values for gypsum in the literature. Sulfide minerals that are derived from biogenic reduction of sulfates can exhibit extremely light isotopic compositions due to kinetic isotopic frac- tionation associated with this process (Seal, 2006). Another source that should be considered is fluids associated with coal, oil, and gas, which often contain sulfides with very light isotopic compositions (Seal, 2006). Chafin (1994) found methane at concentra- tions that exceeded the reporting limit of 0.005 mg/L in 70 of 205 groundwater samples in the Animas River Valley in Colorado and New Mexico. Potential sources of dissolved methane included some biogenic gas from the Animas and Nacimiento Formations but mostly thermogenic gas from deep reservoirs such as the Dakota Sandstone and the Mesaverde Group. The upper Fruitland Formation and Kirtland Shale could also account for some of this observed methane in groundwater. Oxidation of these isotopically light sulfides would result in sulfate with similar light isotopic values, as this process produces negligible sulfur isotope fractionation.

The upper Fruitland Formation and Kirtland Shale could also account for some of this observed methane in groundwater. Oxidation of these isotopically light sulfides would result in sulfate with similar light isotopic values, as this process produces negligible sulfur isotope fractionation. Another complication is the lack of evidence of the occurrence of evaporites in the underlying rocks. Evaporites usually occur as discrete beds of varying thickness; we have not seen the mention of evaporites in the geologic descriptions for the Paleogene rocks and for most of the underlying Cretaceous rocks (Craigg, 2001). The one exception is Todilto Formation, which is over 2,000 meters below surface in the northern portion of the San Juan Basin (Figure 2) and contains a gypsum member. However, the gypsum member of the Todilto Formation is not observed in this area of the San Juan Basin. Also gyp- sum from the Todilto Formation exhibits \u03b434S values ranging from fifteen to seventeen per mil (Kirkland et al., 1995) and is therefore not the source of sulfate in water from AR-0217. While we cannot definitively identify the source of gypsum that contributes sulfate to the high-sulfate endmember(s), we think gypsum distributed diffusively and in localized areas in Neogene rocks, such as the Nacimiento Formation is likely the sulfate source in question. Stable isotopic compositions of DIC\u2014Stable carbon isotopes in DIC are useful for tracing weathering reactions along a flow path and have also been used to confirm the presence of organic contaminants in a groundwater system (Bullen and Kendall, 1998). For a system where a strong acid, such as sulfuric acid, dissolves carbonate rock, the \u03b413C value will be that of the carbonate rock. For a system where carbonic acid, derived from the dissolution of soil CO2, dissolves carbonate rock, this value (\u03b413C) usu- ally represents an intermediate value between the \u03b413C value of the dissolved carbonate and that of soil CO2. Marine carbonates usually exhibit \u03b413C values of 0 \u00b1 5\u2030, while terrestrial and hydrothermal carbonates can have much different values. The stable carbon isotopic composition of soil CO2 depends on the veg- etation type. For C3 plants, which include pine and deciduous trees, soil CO2 exhibits \u03b413C values ranging from -20\u2030 to -37\u2030. For C4 plants, such as corn, soil CO2 shows \u03b413C values ranging from -10 to -20\u2030. Sulfate isotope data discussed above indicate that solute sources for the fresh water mixing end- member are rocks in the Upper Animas watershed. Propylitically altered rock, which underlies 90% of the Upper Animas watershed (Mast et al., 2007), contains a significant amount of calcite and is likely the source of measurable alkalinity in the Upper Animas River. While the \u03b413C values for carbonate minerals and soil CO2 in the Upper Animas watershed are not known, we can estimate these values based on these carbon isotope data and some assumptions. The inverse correlation between \u03b413C (DIC) and bicarbon- ate concentrations seen in Figure 38 is probably mainly due to isotopic fractionation due to calcite precipitation, which is likely occurring based on calculated saturation indices with respect to calcite. The precipitation of calcite results in the enrichment of \u03b413C in the solid carbonate phase and the depletion of \u03b413C for DIC (Turner, 1982). Calculated total DIC concentrations (modeled in PHREEQC) show a rough spatial trend (Figure 48). The decrease in total DIC concentration from north to south (seen north of Aztec) is due to continuous calcite precipitation along the groundwater flow path. Therefore we will assume that the groundwater sample with heaviest isotopic composition for DIC represents that of groundwater in the Upper Animas watershed. Assuming \u03b413C = 0\u2030 for the carbonate rocks in the Upper Animas water- shed, the heaviest observed \u03b413C value for DIC in groundwater of -9.8 \u2030 would result in a \u03b413C value for soil CO2 of about -20\u2030, which is on the heavy end but still within the range for C3 plants. While calcite precipitation appears to be the main control on DIC concentrations and \u03b413C (DIC) north of Aztec, a slight increase in DIC south of Aztec (Figure 48) is due to mixing with the high-sulfate groundwaters, which is also observed in Figure 49, which shows \u03b434S (sulfate) plotted against \u03b413C (DIC).

Assuming the high-sulfate endmember comes from depth, the \u03b413C (DIC) value is likely representative of that for the solute source rock, and the measured \u03b413C (DIC) values for AR-0217 do fall within the range that has been observed for freshwater or terrestrial carbonates (Vitoria et al., 2004). As was discussed above, fluids associated with oil, gas, and coal can also explain the light carbon isotopic composition for DIC (Chafin, 2004). Summary of solute source determination \u2014Geo- chemical data presented above, including general water chemistry, and stable isotope data for water (\u03b4D and \u03b418O), dissolved sulfate (\u03b434S and \u03b418O), and DIC (\u03b413C) indicates that there are two main sources of dissolved constituents: 1) Propylitized bedrock and hydrothermal minerals in the Animas River headwaters 2) Gypsum from underlying strata The sulfate isotope data presented in Figure 46 strongly suggests that the solute source for the fresh water endmember is propylitized bedrock and hy- drothermal minerals in the Upper Animas watershed in Colorado.

The interpretation of general chemistry data and sulfate and DIC isotope data for the iden- tification of the solute source for the high-sulfate endmember is more complicated. Simple stoichio- metric analysis strongly indicates that the solute source is the mineral gypsum, although significant amounts of gypsum are not observed in underlying strata. While more work needs to be done to identify where this gypsum is located, it is most likely that the high-sulfate water source(s) come from the underly- ing Nacimiento Formation and are upwelled into the shallow system as described by the conceptual model shown in Figure 9. Hydrologic and geochemical processes associated with the upwelling of high-sulfate water Water from several wells [AR-0213 (Newton et al., 2017), AR-0217, AR-0187, AR-0019] show high-sul- fate concentrations that appear to be associated with a deep sulfate input that is especially apparent south of Aztec. However, other geochemical data, such as water type and the stable isotopic composition of the water, exhibit differences, suggesting a more complex system. These differences are likely due to variations in water sources (e.g., precipitation from different regions or elevations), flow path lengths or residence time, and spatial variances in lithology. For example, AR-0213, which exhibited the highest sulfate and -15 -10 -5 0 5 10 15 -18 -17 -16 -15 -14 -13 -12 -11 -10 -9 -8 \u03b434Si in Sulfate (\u2030) \u03b413C in DIC(\u2030) Fall 2018, South of Aztec Fall 2018, North of Aztec Spring 2019, South of Aztec Spring 2019, North of Aztec AR-0217 Isotopic exchange with soil CO2 and isotopic fractionation due to calcite precipitation Mixing with high-sulfate water Figure 49. \u03b434S (sulfate) as a function of \u03b413C (DIC). 61 G R O U N D W A T E R M O N I T O R I N G A L O N G T H E A N I M A S R I V E R , N M TDS concentrations (TDS 10,000 mg/L), has a stable isotopic composition that indicates the water source is high elevation precipitation that travels along a very deep regional flow path with a residence time of tens of thousands of years. Along this regional flow path, water-mineral interactions such as dissolution and cation exchange over this long time period results in the observed very brackish sodium-sulfate water. The well AR-0019 is located close to the edge of the valley and is approximately 68 feet deep, which is deeper than many alluvial wells in the study area. For the well AR-0019, the isotopic composition suggests it is river water (evaporation signature) that has traveled along an intermediate flow path, resulting in a slightly brackish (TDS = 2,150 mg/L) calcium-bicarbonate water. This water is likely not nearly as old as water from AR-0213, as a much smaller degree of cation exchange has taken place. The isotopic composition of AR-0217 suggests this is modern water, a mixture of local summer and winter precipitation which flows along a flow path that does not significantly interact with the shallow aquifer. Water that appears to be most affected by the input of deep sulfate occurs south of Aztec and the mechanism by which the deep high-sulfate water discharges into the shallow system is consistent with the conceptual model presented in Figure 9. However this water may interact with the shallow system in different ways as suggested by data for AR-0187, which is located in the northern part of the study area near Cedar Hill where there is a large bend in the river. Water from AR-0187 shows evidence of mixing with high-sulfate water and a high degree of evapora- tion (Figure 34). It is seen in Figure 50 that AR-0187 is located close to the edge of the valley, next to steep Paleogene age cliffs. Interestingly, AR-0238, which is also located near this cliff not too far from AR-0187, shows very different water chemistry, more in line with the freshwater endmember. An irrigation ditch is located between AR-0238 and the cliff, which is likely supplying irrigation water to the alluvial aquifer, whereas the well AR-0187 is located between the cliff and an irrigation ditch. Whether regional high-sulfate groundwater is being upwelled along a fault or it is discharging from the adjacent cliff is unknown. The transition from calcium-bicarbonate water to a calcium-sulfate water with the calcium/sulfate ratio approaching unity (Figure 47) is likely due to the precipitation of calcite, driven by the common ion effect due to the mixing of the freshwater endmember with the high-sulfate water endmember(s). Evidence of the precipitation of calcite includes the inverse relationship between pH and alkalinity (Figure 21), the inverse correlation between \u03b413C (DIC) and bicarbonate concentrations (due to isotopic fraction- ation associated with calcite precipitation, Figure 38), and the observed decrease in total DIC concentrations in the down-gradient direction (Figure 48). Figure 51 shows that with the exception of some water samples with lower relative sulfate concentrations, almost all water samples were saturated with respect to calcite, while almost all water samples were under saturated with respect to gypsum with the saturation index increasing with increasing sulfate concentrations. The observed relationship between the saturation indices for gypsum and calcite and relative sulfate concentra- tions seen in Figure 51 provides more evidence for this geochemical process. Jin et al., (2012) observed this process occurring in a small third-order stream in Wyoming. The discharge of small amounts of groundwater with high calcium and sulfate concentra- tions from the dissolution of gypsum, caused calcite precipitation in the stream due to the common ion effect.

This process is likely occurring in the shallow groundwater system in the Animas Valley. Assessment of redox conditions and manganese and iron sources Based on the discussion above, major ion chemistry in the shallow aquifer in the Animas Valley in New Mexico is controlled by mixing of at least two endmembers and evaporation. The two major solute sources are propylitized bedrock and hydrothermal minerals in the Animas River headwaters and gypsum from underlying strata in the New Mexico reach of the Animas Valley. The mixing process results Figure 50. Google Earth image of well locations for AR-0187 and AR-0238.

Newton et al., (2017) showed that besides TDS and sulfate, other constituents, such as strontium and barium, also increase in concentra- tion in the down-gradient direction. This trend was not observed for other analytes, such as chloride, manganese, and iron (Figure 25 and Figure 26). Minor solutes such as these that are not controlled by the mixing processes described above, are likely controlled by more localized processes. Therefore, the sources of iron and manganese in the shallow aquifer are likely of local origin, deposited as alluvial sedi- ments that make up the aquifer. The measured Eh values and the presence of dissolved manganese in most wells indicates that dissolved oxygen is consumed quickly, resulting in manganese oxides and iron hydroxides being the main redox buffers. The Eh data presented above shows that redox processes are quite dynamic and respond to the different hydrologic regimes related to irrigation. In fall 2018, groundwater in the northern part of the study area showed lower pH and higher Eh values (Figure 29, Figure 30) due to the input of oxygenated river water via irrigation. These low pH and high Eh values were not observed in the spring of 2019. Figure 30 shows that higher dissolved iron and manganese concentrations are associated with lower Eh values. The fall 2018/spring 2019 ratio for Eh values, and manganese and iron concentrations were examined for wells that were sampled both in 2018 and 2019 (Figure 31). Ratios less than 1 indicate higher values in spring 2019 and ratios greater than 1 indicate higher values in the fall of 2018. In general manganese and iron concentrations were higher in spring 2019 and Eh values were higher in the fall of 2018. This inverse relationship between Eh values and iron and manganese concentrations is reflective of the effects of the input of irrigation water during irrigation season and its absence in winter and early spring months on redox conditions in the shallow aquifer. During the irrigation season, oxygenated water that recharges the shallow aquifer drives down the Eh, which results in iron and manganese in some areas to precipitate, causing dissolved concentrations to decrease. After irrigation ends, dissolved oxygen is quickly consumed by the degradation of organic matter, causing Eh values to drop and iron and manganese concentrations to increase. Figure 51.

Areas where DO remained greater than 3 mg/L or fluctuated over a range of DO values that sometimes exceeded 3 mg/L are likely areas where active recharge occurs during irrigation season. Newton et al., (2017) categorized water produced by different wells based on repeated DO measure- ments, as many of the wells shown in Figure 7 were sampled as many as seven times over 18 months.

Newton et al., (2017) demonstrated for many wells that showed this type of DO fluctuation with time, where the concentration would decrease to almost zero and then increase significantly, that there was an inverse relationship between the seasonal change in dissolved oxygen and TDS concentrations.

Figure 52 shows the range of DO values (the differ- ence between the two measurements for this study) as a function of the maximum value for wells that were sampled in both 2018 and 2019. Data points that plot near the 1:1 line indicates that the observed fluctua- tion in DO concentrations ranged from near zero to the observed maximum value. Newton et al., (2017) demonstrated for many wells that showed this type of DO fluctuation with time, where the concentration would decrease to almost zero and then increase significantly, that there was an inverse relationship between the seasonal change in dissolved oxygen and TDS concentrations. The dissolved oxygen would increase and the TDS would decrease due to the input of fresher (lower TDS), well oxygenated irrigation or river water. This trend was not was not as obvious for wells sampled for this study (data not shown). This is likely due to there only being two measurements for each well. While we hoped to capture the full DO fluctuation range by sampling at the end of irrigation season in 2018 and just before irrigation began in 2019, it appears that the timing of these changes in DO concentrations are affected by other factors in addition to the irrigation cycle. These factors may include the finer scale timing of irrigation releases in specific fields, vegetation type and density in different agricultural fields at different times, and antecedent soil moisture conditions. Nevertheless we did observe significant fluctua- tions in DO concentrations as seen in Figure 52. Figure 53 shows well locations with the symbol size proportional to the DO range/DO maximum value (DOrange/DOmax) ratio. This ratio relates to the dynam- ics of the system with respect to DO fluctuations. 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 3.5 4 4.5 5 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 )L /g m ( e g n a R O D Maximum DO (mg/L) 1:1 Figure 52.

Assuming that the observed DO fluctuation with time is due to the input of fresh oxygenated river or irrigation water at a specific time, resulting in higher DO concentrations, followed by a decrease in DO due to degradation of organic matter, a larger ratio may be indicative of an area where this process is occurring. Therefore DOrange/DOmax ratios may be used to identify areas of potential groundwater con- tamination due to the input of contaminated surface water. In Figure 53, most wells with a DOrange/DOmax ratios greater than 0.8 are located very close to the river or near agricultural areas. However, there are many wells with low ratios located in these same areas. Due to the limited number of samples for each well and complications discussed above, this map is likely inaccurate for the purpose of identifying areas of potential contamination, but it serves as an example of a simple method that can be used for this purpose. By monitoring wells in close proximity to the river, ditches, or agricultural fields, on a finer timescale (biweekly or monthly), areas of potential risk of contamination by the input of surface water can likely be identified. The advantage of this method is that DO can be easily measured in real time with electrode instruments that are available from many different vendors at a relatively affordable price. As a word of caution when using this method, instruments that measure dissolved oxygen are quite sensitive, and it is important to properly calibrate the instrument according to the owner\u2019s manual before taking the measurement. Figure 53. Map that shows ratio of the range DO measurements to the Maximum DO value for wells that were sampled in both 2018 and 2019. Larger values indicate a more dynamic system where oxygenated river or irrigation water recharges the aquifer, increasing DO, which decreases over time after irrigation season ends. 65 G R O U N D W A T E R M O N I T O R I N G A L O N G T H E A N I M A S R I V E R , N M V I .

Water level data showed groundwater flowing to the southwest and towards the river (Figure 39 and Figure 40), resulting in the river gaining water from the aquifer over most of the entire reach in New Mexico. However there are some localized areas, particularly in the northern portion of the study area where water levels in some wells close to the river were observed to drop below river stage, indicating a reversal in the hydraulic gradient between the river and the aquifer. This observed gradient reversal appears to mostly occur during the winter and spring when water levels are observed to be their lowest. Historically low discharge rates in the Animas River in 2018 caused water levels in some wells close to the river to drop below water levels observed in past years and in 2019. However, water levels over most of the study area did not appear to be affected, mainly because groundwater levels in the Ani- mas Valley are largely controlled by irrigation. Irrigation water recharges the shallow aquifer by infiltration through fields and irrigation canals, causing water levels to rise.

Sulfate and TDS concentrations increase down-gradient (to the southwest). The conceptual model (Figure 9) that describes geologic controlled upwelling of high-sulfate regional groundwater was largely confirmed. However, this study highlighted some complexities. The stable isotopic compositions of sulfate and DIC suggest that the source of the sulfate being added to the system is likely terrestrial gypsum or anhydrite from underlying strata. However water chemistry data and the stable isotopic composition of water indicate that while there may be a single sulfate source, the water source and flow paths may vary significantly. Stable isotope data for sulfate was compared to data presented by Nordstrom et al., (2007), which included stable isotopic compositions of springs, streams, and rocks in the Upper Animas watershed in Colorado. For groundwater that is chemically similar to river water, it appears that sulfate and likely most other dissolved constituents originate from volcanic rocks and alteration minerals in the Animas headwaters in the San Juan Mountains. Many dissolved metals of concern (both natural and anthropogenic) are present in surface water in the Upper Animas River watershed, which ultimately defines groundwater chemistry in the northern part of the study area. Fortunately, geochemical conditions (pH and redox) result in the precipitation of most of these metals before entering the groundwater system in New Mexico. Again, we saw no evidence of groundwater contamination related to the Gold King Mine spill or legacy acid mine drainage in the San Juan Mountains. Dissolved manganese and iron that is observed to exceed secondary MCLs in some areas is likely due to manganese oxides and iron (hydr)oxides that were deposited as sediments that make up the shallow aquifer. We originally intended to use DO-TDS relation- ships observed by Newton et al., (2017) to identify areas where the input of contaminated surface water (river and irrigation water) poses potential risk of con- taminating the shallow aquifer. The observed increase in DO accompanied by the simultaneous decrease in TDS indicates the input of fresh oxygenated water from the river or irrigation system to the groundwater system. The subsequent increase in TDS and decrease in DO are due to the absence of the additional fresh water and the degradation of organic matter after the surface water is no longer recharging the aquifer in this area. This surface water input is mostly associated with irrigation water in ditches or agricultural fields, but it may occur in some areas near the river. Because we only sampled the wells two times (end of the irrigation season in 2018 and before the irrigation season in 2019), we did not observe the same DO-TDS relation- ships as Newton et al., (2017), who sampled many wells up to seven times over eighteen months. However, we demonstrated the concept of using multiple DO measurements in wells over time to identify these areas of concern. The DOrange/DOmax ratio can be a useful tool for assessing the TDS-DO interactions described above. Larger ratios may be indicative of an area where surface water is recharging the aquifer intermittently, mostly related to irrigation practices. By monitor- ing wells in close proximity to the river, ditches, or agricultural fields, on a biweekly or monthly timescale, areas of potential risk of contamination by the input of surface water can likely be identified.
