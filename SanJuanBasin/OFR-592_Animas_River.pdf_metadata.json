The water released from the Gold King Mine spill was loaded with dissolved metals and contami\u00ad nated sediments, which posed a possible risk to groundwater quality in the Animas Valley. As an immediate response to the spill, the New Mexico Environment Department and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency collaborated with several state and federal agencies, including the U.S. Geological Survey, the New Mexico Office of the State Engineer, and the New Mexico Bureau of Geology and Mineral Resources. Representatives from these groups measured water levels and collected water samples for chemical analysis in over a hundred domestic and irrigation wells in the shallow alluvial aquifer adjacent to the Animas River between Colorado and Farmington, New Mexico. Our team of researchers from the New Mexico Bureau of Geology and Mineral Resources selected a subset of these wells to serve as a monitoring network for the purpose of assessing the spatial and temporal variability of groundwater/surface water interactions, and groundwater quality in the area. The study described in this report uses repeated water level measurements and geochemical analyses sampled between January 2016 and June 2017 to accomplish the following objectives: \u2022 Characterize the hydrogeologic system, which includes the determination of groundwater flow directions, hydraulic gradients, and recharge sources, and the assessment of groundwater/surface water interactions \u2022 Identify areas along the river where the river may be losing water to the shallow aquifer \u2022 Assess the possible impacts of the Gold King Mine spill to shallow groundwater The Animas River flows from the headwaters in the San Juan Mountains, near Silverton, CO to Farmington, NM, where it feeds into the San Juan River. South of Durango, CO, the shallow subsurface geology and exposed rock that bounds the Animas Valley is composed of sedimentary rocks ranging in age from the late Cretaceous to Paleogene age. The spatial arrangement and orientation of these rock is controlled by the structure of the San Juan Basin. The majority of the New Mexico reach of the Animas River flows over the Nacimiento Formation, which pinches out near Farmington, where the underlying Kirtland Shale is observed at the surface. The Animas River from the Colorado-New Mexico border flows through Quaternary alluvial deposits, which are largely made up of sediment eroded from Paleogene rocks into which the Animas River has incised. While municipal or regional drinking water is largely sourced from the Animas River, most private domestic and irrigation wells in the valley rely on the alluvial aquifer, with well depths of about 30 to 60 feet. For this study, we measured water levels and collected water samples from existing wells at different seasons, which were determined based on Animas River flow conditions. Flow conditions targeted for data collection events were: Winter baseflow (January 2016 and 2017), E X E C U T I V E S U M M A R Y N E W M E X I C O B U R E A U O F G E O L O G Y A N D M I N E R A L R E S O U R C E S 2 Pre-irrigation (March 2016 and 2017), Peak snowmelt river flow (June 2016 and 2017), and end of irrigation (October 2016).

During these events, water levels were measured and water samples were collected in wells that were completed in the alluvial aquifer and were within one mile of the river. For each sampling event, water levels were measured in 50 to 80 wells, and water samples were collected in 16 to 26 wells. We collected some water samples in wells that were farther from the river and completed in bedrock that underlies the alluvium with the intention of characterizing regional groundwater. All water samples were analyzed for major anions and cations, trace metals, and the stable isotopes of hydrogen and oxygen. For major cations and trace metals, total and dissolved constituents were measured. For some wells, water samples were analyzed for the environmental tracers, tritium and carbon-14 in order to determine groundwater ages. A subset of wells was also instrumented with data loggers to continuously collect data at hourly intervals. In 25 wells, continuous measurements included water level, and temperature. For 13 of these wells, specific conductance was measured in addition to water level and temperature. Groundwater level measurements were used to construct water table maps to assess groundwater flow direction and the hydraulic gradient between groundwater and the river stage. In general, groundwater flows to the southwest (downstream) and towards the river. In most areas, the Animas River is gaining water from the groundwater, as groundwater from the surrounding valley flows downhill, or down gradient, discharging to the river. However, in some areas, water levels in close proximity to the river have a nearly flat hydraulic gradient between groundwater and the river, where small seasonal fluctuations in groundwater levels and river stage can turn a slightly gaining reach to a slightly losing reach. Groundwater levels in the valley are generally lowest in March, before the irrigation season begins, and highest in October, near the end of the irrigation season. High seasonal water level fluctuations were observed near the Cedar Hill and Inca communities, where we observed an apparent reversal in gradient that changes the river in those areas from a gaining stream in the summer during irrigation season to a losing reach in the winter. The high-resolution groundwater hydrographs observed for wells equipped with data loggers showed distinct patterns that were used to categorize most of the measured wells based on their different hydrograph characteristics. Water levels in wells that exhibit \u201criver-stage- controlled-groundwater\u201d hydrographs have a high correlation to river stage with a distinct increase that correlates to peak snowmelt in the river followed by a rapid drop in groundwater levels through August. Water levels in wells that exhibit \u201cirrigation-controlled\u201d hydrographs begin increasing in late march at the beginning of irrigation season and continue to increase through July and do not begin to decrease until the end of irrigation in late October. This hydrograph type was observed for over 50% of the measured wells. Water levels in wells that exhibit \u201cwinter-recharge/summer-evapotranspiration\u201d hydrographs increase slightly during the winter and decrease during the summer months. General water chemistry, stable isotope, environmental tracer data, and modeling of two-endmember mixing indicate that shallow groundwater is primarily comprised of young river water and older regional groundwater from the underlying Nacimiento Formation. The river water end-member is characterized by low total dissolved solids (less than 500 mg/L), a calcium bicarbonate water type, and high tritium values (above 5 tritium units, modern water). The regional groundwater end-member is characterized by a much higher total dis\u00ad solved solids concentration (about 10,000 mg/L), a sodium sulfate water type, undetectable 3 G R O U N D W A T E R M O N I T O R I N G A L O N G T H E A N I M A S R I V E R , N M tritium content, and an apparent carbon-14 age of approximately 20,000 years before present. The observed spatial trend of increasing concentrations for sulfate and total dissolved solids in the general groundwater flow direction (southwest) is the result of the upwelling of regional groundwater due to the gradual thinning of the Nacimiento Formation, which pinches out near Farmington. While the river water is by far the most dominant recharge source, account\u00ad ing for over 80% of the mixture in all water samples collected from the alluvial aquifer, the input of regional groundwater significantly affects water quality by increasing the total dis\u00ad solved solids content to above 1,000 mg/L in some areas. Groundwater with total dissolved solids concentration over 1,000 mg/L greatly exceeds the secondary maximum contaminant level as defined by secondary EPA drinking water regulations (500 mg/L), and can affect the ability to grow some crops. Discrepancies between modeled and observed chloride, barium, and strontium concentra\u00ad tions suggest a small degree of mixing with a third endmember component. We hypothesize that this other mixing component is a brine characterized by high chloride, barium, and stron\u00ad tium concentrations, and low sulfate. High-chloride, low-sulfate brines have been observed in the San Juan Basin from Cretaceous rocks that lay beneath the study area. Many brines that have been observed in the San Juan Basin are associated with oil and gas that resides in these geologic formations.

In some wells that were equipped with data loggers, an abrupt change in specific conductance and/or temperature trends that correlated with groundwater level increases were clearly indicative of the mixing of river water with local groundwater. Observed temporal variability of dissolved oxygen in wells also provided evidence of river water recharging the groundwater system. Significant increases in dissolved oxygen observed between sampling events in individ\u00ad ual wells were usually accompanied by slight decreases in total dissolved solids, indicating the addition river water, which is characterized by high dissolved oxygen and relatively low total dissolved solids concentrations, to the shallow aquifer. Water sampled in many wells sustained low dissolved oxygen concentrations (<3mg/L) over the duration of this study. In contrast, dissolved oxygen concentrations in some wells varied significantly over time (by over 4 mg/L), indicating a more dynamic system in that area where river water recharges the aquifer. River water primarily recharges the shallow aquifer as a result of irrigation practices in the area. During the growing season (March through October), water is diverted from the river into irrigation ditches and canals that transport water to agricultural fields. Water seep\u00ad ing through the bottoms of canals and ditches and past the root zone in agricultural fields recharges the shallow aquifer, resulting in groundwater levels increasing significantly during irrigation season throughout most of the study area, as was observed from groundwater level measurements in the majority of wells. While the seepage of irrigation water through canal and ditch bottoms and agricultural fields is the primary mechanism by which river water enters the aquifer, there is evidence that water can infiltrate directly from the river into the aquifer in some areas. Therefore, we recommend that in the event of another mine water release, that residents with a well within 300 feet of the river (especially near the communities of Inca and Cedar Hill) discontinue pumping of the well temporarily until the contaminant plume in the river has passed. Potential groundwater contaminants identified in water and sediments associated with the Gold King Mine spill include iron, aluminum, manganese, lead, copper, arsenic, zinc, N E W M E X I C O B U R E A U O F G E O L O G Y A N D M I N E R A L R E S O U R C E S 4 cadmium, and mercury. Measurements for most of the metals mentioned above were either below U.S. Environmental Protection Agency maximum contaminant levels, or were below the reporting limit of the analysis. Several wells in the shallow aquifer produced water that exceeds U.S. Environmental Protection Agency secondary maximum contaminal levels for dis\u00ad solved iron and manganese. Observed Eh values indicate redox conditions that are favorable for the reduction of manganese resulting in the dissolution of manganese oxides. The lower end of the observed range in Eh values (about 200 millivolts) suggest that small decreases in Eh result in the reduction of iron and the dissolution of iron (hydr)oxides. Most groundwater samples with the highest iron and manganese concentrations exhibit Eh values of less than 200 millivolts, which accounts for about 25% of the water samples collected for this study. It is difficult to determine the source of iron and manganese. While iron and manganese were observed at high concentrations in the Gold King Mine spill plume and water in the Animas River has relatively high iron and manganese total concentrations (most is likely adsorbed onto colloids and other particulates), these metals are also present in the aquifer sediments. Therefore, the spatial distribution of water that is high in iron and manganese may be controlled by the location where these minerals were dominantly deposited within the alluvial aquifer. In addition, potentially contaminated river sediment (some of which may have been associated with the Gold King Mine spill) deposited in irrigation ditches and canals may also be a source of manganese and iron. As irrigation water infiltrates through these sediments, metals such as iron, manganese and aluminum may be mobilized and transported to the shallow water table. Results from this study do not suggest that the groundwater quality has necessarily been impacted by this mechanism. However, continued monitoring of groundwater quality is recommended. Groundwater in the alluvial aquifer is estimated to be, on average, less than 10 years old and is a mixture of very young water derived from recent spring runoff in the San Juan Mountains and older irrigation recharge from past irri\u00ad gation seasons. Therefore, it may be several years before an impact to water quality in the shallow aquifer can be observed. We also need to consider the spatial distribution of reductants, such as organic matter, septic contamination, and possibly hydrocarbons and how it relates to spatial variability of manganese and iron concentrations in groundwater. In areas with an increased amount of reductants, biodegradation can decrease the Eh significantly, resulting in the dissolution of manganese oxides and iron (hydr)oxides at a higher rate. The well that exhibited the highest dissolved iron and manganese concentrations also had the highest chloride and barium con\u00ad tent, possibly providing additional evidence of a high-chloride, low-sulfate brine that may be associated with oil or gas that has leaked into the shallow aquifer either by natural or anthro\u00ad pogenic pathways. The biodegradation of leaked hydrocarbons in the aquifer could decrease Eh values significantly, resulting in the observed increased dissolved manganese and iron concentrations in groundwater in this area. With groundwater pH being fairly neutral and constant between 6.7 and 8.3, and with manganese and iron buffering the redox conditions, it is unlikely that metals associated with the Gold King Mine spill will be contaminants of concern in this groundwater system.

After the Gold King Mine (Figure 1) released metal and sludge-laden water into Cement Creek and the Animas River on August 5, 2015, the agency began a hydrologic assessment focused on the alluvial aquifer adjacent to the Animas River in New Mexico, from the Colorado state line to Farmington, NM. The purpose of this project was to evaluate possible effects from the mine release on the shallow groundwater near the Animas River. Accomplishing this requires an understanding of the seasonal changes to the surface water-groundwater system and long-term monitoring of the groundwater quality conditions along this reach of the Animas River. The Gold King Mine Spill and Response T here is a long history of natural acid rock drainage and acid mine drainage in the headwater region of the Animas River, along the western San Juan Mountains near Silverton, Colorado.

B\u2014This simplified cross-section shows the general arrangement of rocks and the structural framework of the San Juan Basin. The subsurface shape of the San Juan Basin is roughly a large bowl-shape depression, dipping northward. mountain streams, including Cement Creek and the upper Animas River (Church et al., 2007; Yager and et al., 2016). On August 5, 2015, in an attempt to repair drainage issues in the Level 7 adit of the Gold King Mine, workers accidentally breached the earthen plug holding back acidic water in the vertical mine workings. As the mine workings rapidly drained, the released water also gained an estimated 490,000 kg (~540 tons) of metals and sediment from waste rock piles below the mine (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2016). Cement Creek was soon flooded with yellow-orange, sediment laden water from the Gold King Mine and surrounding area. This water-sedi\u00ad ment mixture contained high concentrations of iron, aluminum, manganese, lead, copper, arsenic, zinc, cadmium, and some mercury (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2016). Within about 3 days, the yellow water had flowed down the Animas River to Farmington, New Mexico where it entered the San Juan River. Immediately following the Gold King Mine spill, many questions were asked about the connection of the Animas River to the surrounding groundwater. Could there be contamination of the groundwater aquifer along the river? How exactly do the ground\u00ad water and surface water interact? How might Gold King Mine spill sediments deposited in the river bed or irrigation ditches affect groundwater? In August 2015, in collaboration with the U.S. Geological Survey, New Mexico Office of the State Engineer, and New Mexico Environment Department, the New Mexico Bureau of Geology and Mineral Resources collected groundwater level measure\u00ad ments at over 100 locations along the Animas River. The goal of these measurements was to identify gaining or losing reaches of the river system.

Geologic Background T he geology of the area described here is summa\u00ad rized from Craigg (2001), which is part of a larger review of the geology found in the San Juan Basin A B 7 G R O U N D W A T E R M O N I T O R I N G A L O N G T H E A N I M A S R I V E R , N M (Figure 2A). The Animas River in northwest New Mexico flows through the northwestern margin of the San Juan Basin, which is an asymmetric structural depression (Figure 2B) in the Colorado Plateau province. Below and surrounding the alluvial aquifer, the geology along the Animas River from Durango to Farmington consists of sedimentary rocks of late cretaceous to Paleogene age (Figure 3). Near Durango, the Animas River flows over the Animas Formation, which is made up of interbedded tuffa\u00ad ceous sandstone, conglomerate and shale. In the Cedar Hill region, the nearby surrounding hills/ mesas are composed primarily of Eocene (~50\u201355 Ma) San Jose Formation, and Paleocene (~60\u201365 Ma) Nacimiento Formation. The San Jose is an interbed\u00ad ded very fine to coarse-grained arkosic sandstone. The Nacimiento Formation consists of interbedded gray shale, and discontinuous lenses of sandstone and interfingers with the Paleocene Ojo Alamo Sandstone, which consists of arkosic sandstone and conglomerate. The Ojo Alamo Formation outcrops just north of Farmington, New Mexico. Along the river in the proximity of Farmington, outcrops of late Cretaceous (~75 Ma) Kirtland Shale are found. The Kirtland Shale consists of interbedded repetitive sequences of sandstone, siltstone, shale and claystone. The Kirtland Shale helps cap the Fruitland Formation below, which consists of carbonaceous shale and coal (Craigg, 2001). The majority of the New Mexico reach of the Animas River flows over the Nacimiento Formation. There are no major structural features (i.e. faults or folds) along the river corridor. The Animas River from the Colorado-New Mexico border flows through Quaternary alluvial deposits. The Quaternary alluvium is largely made up of sediment eroded from Paleogene rocks into which the Animas River has incised. While municipal or regional drinking water is largely sourced from Figure 3. Simplified geologic map and geologic cross-section. A\u2014The black line is the location of the cross-section, shown in B, that runs roughly that runs roughly parallel to the Animas River from Durango to Farmington.

Also included are the 95th and 5th percentile flows observed at the gauge. the Animas River, most private domestic wells in the valley rely on the alluvial aquifer, with well depths of about 30 to 60 feet. The Animas River T he headwaters of the Animas River originate high in the San Juan Mountains, in the Silverton Mining District. Two other main tributaries drain from this mineral rich region and join the Animas River in Silverton, including Cement Creek and Mineral Creek. These mineral-rich streams account for roughly a third of the observed flow measured in Farmington, NM (~80 cubic feet per second (cfs) at baseflow). The Animas flows through the Animas Canyon, between Silverton and Durango (roughly 50 miles), where it is fed by numerous smaller streams that flow into the canyon. By the time the river reaches Durango, it has more than doubled in volume. Just north of the New Mexico-Colorado border, the Florida River feeds into the Animas River. By the time the Animas enters New Mexico the river discharge is roughly equal to the flow measured at Farmington, NM, (~300 cfs at baseflow). The Animas River meanders roughly 40 miles from the New Mexico border, to Farmington, where it joins the San Juan River. The San Juan River flows an addi\u00ad tional ~180 miles through New Mexico and Utah before discharging into Lake Powell. The discharge of the Animas River fluctuates with the seasons. In Farmington, just upstream of where the Animas River discharges into the San Juan River, the U.S. Geological Survey has recorded over 90 years of river discharge measure\u00ad ments (Figure 4). The median daily discharge varies from 208 cfs at its lowest, to nearly 3,000 cfs at its peak. In general, the river discharge begins to rise slowly in April as early snow melt enters the river. Discharge continues to increase throughout May as temperatures in the mountains feeding the head- waters rises, melting more snow. The river typically reaches peak discharge between late May and mid-June as the main pulse of snowmelt moves through the river. The discharge declines through late summer as the snowpack diminishes. Through- out the late summer, river discharge often rises rapidly as a result of monsoon storms, before ebbing back to previous levels. By late August the river has returned to a baseflow. The river is often lowest during early fall as result of diversions for irrigation, and higher evapotranspiration rates. Moving into fall and winter the river remains relatively steady at roughly 300 cfs. 9 G R O U N D W A T E R M O N I T O R I N G A L O N G T H E A N I M A S R I V E R , N M Sample Site Inventory S ample locations and data discussed in this report are found in Figures 5\u20137, Tables 1 and 2, and the Appendices.

The data include groundwater level mea\u00ad surements, groundwater chemistry data, surface water measurements (water levels and stable isotopes), and continuous records of water levels, temperatures, and in some wells, specific conductance. Data col\u00ad lected by U.S. Environmental Protection Agency from August 2015 are included in our analyses, as well as data from previous years, reported in Timmons et al. (2016). Well sites used in this study were all existing wells, most of them being privately owned domestic or irrigation wells. Well selection priorities included (1) proximity to the Animas River, (2) proximity to agricultural irrigation ditches, (3) wells that were previously sampled by U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in August 2015, and (4) wells with owners that were cooperative and willing to allow repeated sampling. Selected wells for repeat sampling were completed in the alluvial aquifer, and within approximately 1 mi on either side of the Animas River, from the Colorado state line to Farmington, NM. Wells completed in the alluvium are typically shallow, generally between 30 to 60 feet deep (Table 1). We sampled several wells outside of the valley on the surrounding bluffs (Figure 6). These wells are much deeper and are completed in the Eocene (~50\u201355 Ma) San Jose Formation and Paleocene (~60\u201365 Ma) Nacimiento Formation and Ojo Alamo Sandstone. Data collected from each sampling event were used to assess hydrogeologic processes at these locations, for the event season. Spatial coordinates (easting and northing) for all sample sites were determined using a handheld GPS receiver, and then corrected based on satellite imagery. At each site we photographed the well and documented site-specific information, such as well depth, casing diameter, casing stick-up height, etc. We determined surface elevations at each site and river stage elevations using high resolution elevation data from LiDAR (U.S. Geological Survey, 2015). The dataset collected over the Animas River Valley was delivered as a raster with 1 m2 resolution, with an elevation accuracy of 7\u201316 cm. The improved spatial resolution of the LiDAR dataset allowed us to more accurately estimate the water level elevation based on the higher resolution ground surface elevation. Timing of Groundwater Level Measurements and Sample Collection F or this study, groundwater level measurements and water samples for geochemical analyses were collected during high flows (snowmelt runoff, spring) and low flows (baseflow, winter), as well as irrigation onset and monsoon storm events. Sampling events occurred at the following time periods: January 26\u201327, 2016; March 14\u201317, 2016; May 31\u2013June 10; October 17\u201321, 2016; January 23-February 3, 2017; March 13\u201324, 2017; and May 29\u2013June 9, 2017 (Figure 8). Groundwater level measurements are found in Appendix B, and chemical data from water sampling are presented in Appendix C. Water Level Measurements W ater levels were measured following U.S. Geo- logical Survey protocols for a steel tape measure\u00ad ment device with repeat measurements to within 0.02 ft (Cunningham and Schalk, 2011). If water level measurements were not repeatable within 0.02 ft, notes were made and entered into database suggesting that these measurements were of lower data quality. This may happen for various reasons, such as when the well is pumping, recovering, or a nearby site is being pumped. The goal is to obtain a static water level measurement which is confirmed by a repeatable measurement within 0.02 ft. All manual groundwater level measurements are found in Appendix B. Water level data from pressure transducers with data record\u00ad ers are available from the New Mexico Bureau of Geology and Mineral Resources upon request. To assess the nature of the seasonal groundwa\u00ad ter flow direction, four water table maps were made from the water level monitoring network for each of the unique sampling periods collected in 2016.

These continuous water level data were then adjusted based on manual water level measure\u00ad ments that were done at the time of the download. These adjustments that are based on the difference between the manual water level measurement and the corresponding instrument measurement (recorded at the time closest to that of the manual measure\u00ad ment) were applied to continuous water level data going backward in time, to the previous site download/measurement. As noted in Table 2, a subset of these data recorders (CTD Divers) measured specific con\u00ad ductance in addition to temperature and pressure. Throughout the duration of this study, the factory calibrated instruments yielded specific conductance measurements within 5% of measurements made independently in the field with instruments that had been recently calibrated against known standards. Therefore the recalibration of the CTD Divers was not necessary. Water Sampling S ampling protocols used by New Mexico Bureau of Geology and Mineral Resources are described in more detail by Timmons et al. (2013), and as specified in the New Mexico Bureau of Geology and Mineral Resources protocols for clean sampling (Appendix D). The goal was to collect water samples that were chemically representative of local ground\u00ad water from existing domestic and irrigation wells that were equipped with pumps. Most of these wells are used regularly, and therefore well bore water is mobile and likely does not reside in the well casing long enough for the chemical composition of the water to change significantly. However, we still took extra precautions to ensure the integrity of the water sample. General water sampling procedures include purging the well until field parameters (pH, dissolved oxygen, specific conductivity, oxida\u00ad tion-reduction potential (ORP), and temperature), which are being monitored in real time, stabilize before collecting the sample. In order to prevent contamination of the samples from external sources and cross-contamination from other samples, we followed a strict sampling protocol (Appendix D).

Building from the original network of wells, the monitoring network established by the New Mexico Bureau of Geology and Mineral Resources consisted of 50 to 80 wells measured during the following periods: baseflow (late-January), initial snowmelt/onset of irrigation season (mid-March), peak snowmelt/ extended irrigation season (early-June), and at the end of irrigation season (mid-October). Occasionally, wells were not measured during one or more of the measurement campaigns due to scheduling conflicts, freezing conditions, or if well owners opted out of the program (Appendix B). Figure 9 shows the magnitude of annual fluctuations recorded from each well\u2019s water level measurements in 2016. In general, wells located farther from the river have greater fluctuation. The reach between Aztec and Inca is where we see the largest annual fluctuation. Areas that experience significant fluctuation are susceptible to changes in groundwater flow direction. I I I .

Our observations show that in a broad sense, the Animas River is gaining water from the groundwater, as groundwater from the surrounding valley flows downhill, or down gradient, discharging to the river. However, by looking at the water levels in close proximity to the river, we found that the water table gradient can be nearly flat (low gradient). In some locations (indicated as red points on the water table maps, Figure 10), we observed that the water table elevation is below river elevation, suggesting that the Figure 10.

With a flat or nearly flat water table, fluctuations in the river stage can turn a slightly gaining reach to a slightly losing reach. The differ\u00ad ence between groundwater elevations and the river stage elevation, in places, is small (less than 1 ft), so it may not be detected by coarse resolution water table mapping. Groundwater levels in the val\u00ad ley were generally lowest in March, before the irrigation season begins, and highest in October, near the end of the irrigation season. Therefore, by comparing the water table map contoured from the March data to the map based on October water level data, we can better understand seasonal changes in groundwater flow conditions. Two areas that show the largest seasonal variations are the Cedar Hill area (Figure 11A), and the Inca area (Figure 11B). Looking closely at the water table changes in the Cedar Hill area, the hydraulic gra\u00ad dient between the river and the aquifer reverses from losing conditions (river recharging aquifer) in March, which was seen in specific wells that are close to the river and are highlighted in red, to gaining conditions (groundwater discharging to river) in October. The Inca area shows the largest seasonal groundwater level fluctua\u00ad tion. From the water table contoured using the March water level measure\u00ad ments, the hydraulic gradient near Inca dramatically flattens during the winter/non-irrigation period. While it isn\u2019t uncommon that the water table gradient flattens out during this period, the flat gradient extends farther from the river, and to a greater degree than other locations along river.

Locations of different hydrograph type wells. examined observed temporal fluctuations in water levels and how these fluctuations vary throughout the study area. Continuous water level measurements in many wells (Table 2) showed clear seasonal water level fluctuations. From the groundwater monitoring network, 75 wells had at least three manual measure\u00ad ments from which to assess seasonal fluctuations. We used continuous water level data to help fill in the gaps between sampling periods for manual water level datasets to better assess fluctuations that were missed between sampling events. Additionally, this allowed us to more effectively define and group the manual hydrographs into distinguishable trends. The trends are characterized by the magnitude of the seasonal fluctuations, and the timing of the peak in groundwater level. From studying the con\u00ad tinuous pressure records we identified three main hydrograph trends: 1) river-stage-controlled, 2) irrigation-controlled, and 3) winter-recharge/summer- evapotranspiration (Figure 12). The first hydrograph trend, the river-stage-con\u00ad trolled hydrographs (Figure 13) indicates a hydraulic connection to the river. These records correlate with the stage of the Animas River, and represent 22 of the 70 wells with distinguishable hydrograph trends. In general, these wells fluctuate rapidly, mimicking the stage of the river. The most distinct feature in the river-stage-controlled water hydrographs is the rise in water level in early June, which coincides with peak snowmelt moving through the valley. This peak is gen\u00ad erally followed by a rapid drop in groundwater level through August. By late September, groundwater lev\u00ad els have stabilized and remain relatively flat through the winter. Wells that have the river-stage-controlled trend are typically closest to the river (median distance of 320 ft) and exhibit a median annual water level fluctuation of 3.5 ft. These wells are very shallow with a median total depth of 31 ft, and a median depth-to-water of about 9.4 ft below ground surface. The close proximity of these wells to the river plays a large part in the fluctuations that characterize this group. Moving farther away from the Animas River, the effect of the stage of the river is muted and the impact of irrigation can also be distinguished. 21 G R O U N D W A T E R M O N I T O R I N G A L O N G T H E A N I M A S R I V E R , N M The irrigation-controlled hydrograph trend is the most prevalent amongst the wells measured (38 of 70 wells), and is heavily influenced by the irriga\u00ad tion season (Figure 14). These wells clearly show the alluvial aquifer being recharged during the irrigation season. Where the river-stage-controlled hydrographs are generally prone to sharp spikes in water levels as they respond to the irregular flow of the river, the irrigation-controlled trend is characterized by smooth seasonal fluctuations. When the ditches are first filled in late March, the groundwater level begins to rapidly rise, similar to how the river-stage-controlled- groundwater wells respond to early snow melt runoff floods. What distinguishes the rise in water level seen in the irrigation-controlled hydrographs is the timing and magnitude of the change. While the river-stage- controlled-groundwater hydrographs peak rapidly in June before declining, the irrigation-controlled trend rises through June, and generally doesn\u2019t reach its maximum until late July. Water levels typically remain elevated in these wells until the end of the irrigation season, when the ditches are shut off. At this point, there is a sharp drop in water levels as the ditches are no longer supplying water to the alluvial aquifer. The declining leg of these hydrographs begins flattening as the water level appears to approach equilibrium before the irrigation season begins again. Wells that have this irrigation-controlled trend are much farther away from the river than the wells that exhibit the other hydrograph types (median distance of 1,810 ft). These wells also display the largest annual change in water level, with a median fluctuation of 5.7 ft. These wells are typically deeper with a median total depth Figure 13.

The intake of the Ralston ditch, where it takes its water from the Animas River, is located in the northern end of the study area, 1.3 miles south of the Colorado border. This data is available from the New Mexico Office of the State Engineer (meas.ose.state.nm.us). of 43 ft and a median depth-to-water of about 14.7 ft below ground surface. The irrigation season is important both for the economy of the area and the recharge of the alluvial aquifer. The return groundwater flow from irrigated land and the water lost through the base of the irriga\u00ad tion ditches supports the water table. This in turn contributes to gaining river conditions seen through\u00ad out the valley. The third hydrograph trend is much more subtle. A smaller portion of the wells in the study area show the impact of winter-recharge/summer-evapotranspi\u00ad ration (10 of 70 wells). Unlike wells that exhibit the other hydrograph trends, these wells have an increase in water level in the winter (Figure 15). In some of these hydrographs, we can distinguish recharge events that are associated with individual snow storms. These brief sharp increases in water level are best observed in AR-0028. During the summer these wells typically show water level declines that are likely the result of increased evapotranspiration. Wells that show this winter-recharge/summer-evapotranspiration trend are generally located within the flood plain, a median distance of 1,160 ft away from the river. This trend shows the smallest seasonal variability, with a median annual fluctuation of 2.1 ft. These wells are typically very shallow with a median total depth of about 20 ft and a median depth-to-water of about 2.5 ft below ground surface. The shallow nature of the water table where these wells are found plays a large role in the seasonal fluctuations. Because the water table is so close to the surface in these areas, plant roots are in direct contact with the aquifers.

AR-0037 is on the south side of the river half way between Aztec and Farmington and has a total depth of 320 ft. AR-0067 is located north of Aztec with a total depth of 61 ft. AR-0213 and AR-0214 are deep wells on the north side of the river between Aztec and Farmington, outside of the flood\u00ad plain, with total depths of 500 ft and 370 ft respec\u00ad tively. All of these wells, according to driller\u2019s logs, appear to be completed in bedrock below the alluvial fill. However, as will be discussed below, AR-0213 and AR-0214 were the only wells that appears to produce regional groundwater that were clearly geochemically distinct compared all other groundwa\u00ad ter samples. Field parameters were measured for the Animas River and selected irrigation ditches during March and June 2017 (Figure 16, Table 5). Water temperature and specific conductance were also measured continuously with data loggers installed in several wells throughout the study area (Figure 5). Dissolved oxygen\u2014While dissolved oxygen was measurable in all wells for all sampling events, mea\u00ad sured dissolved oxygen in the shallow groundwater varied considerably spatially from one well to another and temporally within some individual wells. Because dissolved oxygen concentration can have a significant effect on water quality, specifically on the solubility of metals, we used the observed variability in dis\u00ad solved oxygen to group wells into different categories that will be used in analyses discussed below. Figure 17 shows the range of dissolved oxygen concentration for each well as a function of the maximum measured dissolved oxygen, as well as the different dissolved oxygen categories. Wells were categorized as low dissolved oxygen wells, with concentrations below 3 mg/L for all samples collected at different times, and with small variability over time.

Field parameters measured on the Animas River, ditches, and the San Juan River just below Farmington. Map locations shown in Figure 16. Figure 17. The range of dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations as a function of the maximum dissolved oxygen value for each well with 2 or more measurements at different times. Most wells with higher maximum dissolved oxygen concentrations also exhibit a larger range in dissolved oxygen. Low dissolved oxygen wells had concentrations below 3 mg/L for all samples collected from that well between January 2016 and June 2017. Mixed dissolved oxygen wells exhibited at least one dissolved oxygen concentration greater than 3 mg/L. The higher range in concentrations for mixed dissolved oxygen wells suggests a more dynamic biogeochemical system. High dissolved oxygen wells had concentrations higher than 3 mg/L for all samples collected over the period of the study. 25 G R O U N D W A T E R M O N I T O R I N G A L O N G T H E A N I M A S R I V E R , N M observed range of specific conductance values in indi\u00ad vidual wells over time varied between 19 and 1,287 \u03bcS/cm. In other words, specific conductance was very constant over time in some wells, while in other wells, this value was observed to vary significantly over the time span of this study. Large temporal fluctuations in specific conductance likely indicates the mixing waters with very different specific conductance values or the occurrence of processes that affect the concen\u00ad tration of dissolved minerals, such as mineral disso\u00ad lution or evaporation. For the regional wells (Table 4), all specific conductance values are on the high end of the observed range of values with water from AR-0213 exhibiting the highest specific conductance by an order of magnitude (12,049 \u03bcS/cm). AR-0214 showed the next highest specific conductance at 3,512 \u03bcS/cm. The specific conductance of the Animas River samples collected during March 2017 in many locations in New Mexico averaged 384 \u03bcS/cm. For samples collected all along the river, including some locations in Colorado in June 2017, specific con\u00ad ductance averaged 179 \u03bcS/cm. The lower values in June are due to the spring runoff water being mostly snowmelt from mountain streams. The higher values in March, just before the spring runoff, indicate some degree of base flow conditions where groundwater discharge contributed a significant amount of water to the river. While specific conductance values in the river can vary substantially throughout the year, they are significantly less than the specific conductance measured in most groundwater in the study area. Continuous specific conductance measurements in most wells with data loggers had fairly constant values over time. However, a few continuous specific conductance datasets showed fluctuations indica\u00ad tive of the mixing different source waters.

        "Text": "R , N M observed range of specific conductance values in indi\u00ad vidual wells over time varied between 19 and 1,287 \u03bcS/cm. In other words, specific conductance was very constant over time in some wells, while in other wells, this value was observed to vary significantly over the time span of this study. Large temporal fluctuations in specific conductance likely indicates the mixing waters with very different specific conductance values or the occurrence of processes that affect the concen\u00ad tration of dissolved minerals, such as mineral disso\u00ad lution or evaporation. For the regional wells (Table 4), all specific conductance values are on the high end of the observed range of values with water from AR-0213 exhibiting the highest specific conductance by an order of magnitude (12,049 \u03bcS/cm). AR-0214 showed the next highest specific conductance at 3,512 \u03bcS/cm. The specific conductance of the Animas River samples collected during March 2017 in many locations in New Mexico averaged 384 \u03bcS/cm. For samples collected all along the river, including some locations in Colorado in June 2017, specific con\u00ad ductance averaged 179 \u03bcS/cm. The lower values in June are due to the spring runoff water being mostly snowmelt from mountain streams. The higher values in March, just before the spring runoff, indicate some degree of base flow conditions where groundwater discharge contributed a significant amount of water to the river. While specific conductance values in the river can vary substantially throughout the year, they are significantly less than the specific conductance measured in most groundwater in the study area. Continuous specific conductance measurements in most wells with data loggers had fairly constant values over time. However, a few continuous specific conductance datasets showed fluctuations indica\u00ad tive of the mixing different source waters. Figure 19 shows continuous water level and specific conduc\u00ad tance data for AR-0075, which is located near Inca and less than ten feet from the river. The continuous data set spans about six months between November 2016 and June 2017. During the winter, the water level and specific conductance were fairly constant. U.S. Geological Survey stream discharge data for the Animas River below Aztec showed spring runoff began in early March 2017. The water level in the well strongly correlated with river discharge. Shortly after the water level rose, specific conductance dropped significantly, indicating an input of river water with relatively low specific conductance to the aquifer in the nearby river bank. Figure 20 shows continuous water level and spe\u00ad cific conductance data for four wells and an irrigation Figure 18. Locations of wells categorized by observed maximum dis\u00ad solved oxygen (DO) concentration and temporal variability of dissolved oxygen concentrations. Low DO wells exhibited dissolved oxygen mea\u00ad surements less than 3 mg/L, mixed DO wells had DO values both less than and greater than 3 mg/L, and high DO wells exhibited dissolved oxygen values greater than 3 mg/L.

The abrupt increase in water level and spe\u00ad cific conductance in the ditch (AR-0522) indicates the beginning of the irrigation season in mid-April. Specific conductance values observed for the water in the ditch, which is river water that was diverted to the irrigation canals, are significantly lower than those observed in groundwater. Groundwater wells AR-0044, AR-0052, AR-0059, and AR-0112 are approximately 1,337; 849; 332; and 256 feet from the river, respectively. For these four wells, there is an inverse correlation between specific conductance and the water level in the well. Between November 2016 and April 2017, water levels decline slowly while spe\u00ad cific conductance values increase slightly. Observed increases in water levels are apparently due to the initiation of irrigation season, which coincides with decreases in specific conductance. This observation indicates the input of fresher river water (via irriga\u00ad tion) into the aquifer, diluting the groundwater that has higher ion concentrations than river water used for irrigation. Temperature\u2014Water temperatures varied signifi\u00ad cantly both spatially and temporally, ranging from 7.30 to 17.34 \u00b0C. It should be noted that the lowest water temperature was exhibited by AR-0075, which is less than ten feet from the river as discussed above (Figure 19). In March 2016 and March 2017, water temperatures in well AR-0075 were 7.92 \u00b0C and 7.30 \u00b0C respectively, were significantly less than tempera\u00ad tures observed in all other wells. In March 2017, measured river water temperatures ranged from 8 \u00b0C to 15 \u00b0C (Table 5). The low temperature observed in AR-0075 is likely due to local recharge to the shallow aquifer from the river. Continuous temperature data from data log\u00ad gers helps to explain the variability we observed for water temperatures during sampling. Figure 21 shows continuous water temperatures for AR-0028 from September 2015 to May 2017 along with average monthly air temperatures measured at the Farmington Four Corners Regional Airport. Air temperature data shows the expected sinusoidal seasonal fluctuations with the highest temperatures in the summer and the lowest temperatures in the winter. Water temperature data exhibit sinusoidal seasonal fluctuations with a wavelength similar to that observed for air tempera\u00ad tures (one year) but with a significant phase shift and a smaller amplitude. These seasonal water tempera\u00ad ture fluctuations are controlled by the air temperature and are due to conductive heat transfer between the atmosphere and the subsurface. The magnitude of the phase shift (lag time) and the degree to which the amplitude of water temperature fluctuations is decreased or dampened depends on the thermal char\u00ad acteristics of the soil and the depth at which tempera\u00ad tures are being measured. Therefore, because water temperature was measured at different depths, and in Figure 19. Continuous water level and specific conductance data for AR-0075 and river discharge data from the USGS gauge below Aztec (09364010). The water level in the well (depth of water above the sensor) correlates strongly with river discharge. A significant decrease in specific conductance values, which coincides with spring runoff, indicates that river water is entering the aquifer near that well and affecting the water quality.

This water temperature trend cannot be identi\u00ad fied with measurements being taken at time intervals longer than one month. However, with continuous measurements, this seasonal water temperature trend (or the deviation from this trend) may be used to pro\u00ad vide evidence of the mixing of source waters. Figure 22 shows continuous water level and temperature data for AR-0181, located near Farmington, approxi\u00ad mately 386 feet from the river. The water temperature in this well shows a slight increase in November 2016 and then begins to decrease by January 2017 and continues to decrease throughout the rest of the record. Temperature data from November 2016 through late March 2017 can be explained by con\u00ad ductive heat transfer between the atmosphere and the subsurface as described above. The temperature decrease that begins in early April 2017 deviates from this trend and exhibits a much higher rate of cooling than observed prior to that time. This steep cooling trend, which coincides with increased water levels that are associated with the start of irrigation season, strongly suggests that irrigation water of cooler temperatures is recharging the shallow aquifer and decreasing the water temperature in this area. Not all continuous temperature data had such a straight forward explanation. Most continuous data records for this study are just a little over six months long. Multi-year continuous water temperature records for different wells can provide important information about the local hydrologic system. Oxidation Reduction Potential\u2014Oxidation reduc\u00ad tion potential (ORP) measurements reflect the oxidizing or reducing tendency or \u201credox state\u201d of the water. The redox state of the shallow alluvial aquifer near the Animas River is particularly impor\u00ad tant because it controls the reactivity and mobil\u00ad ity of many important elements and metals. Figure 23 shows what is known as the \u201credox ladder,\u201d as illustrated in Langmuir (1997), along with box and whisker plots for calculated Eh values for all well samples collected for this study. While the redox state is a factor that controls many important biogeo\u00ad chemical reactions, Eh measurements provide limited information about specific redox reactions that are taking place. Because many redox reactions between N E W M E X I C O B U R E A U O F G E O L O G Y A N D M I N E R A L R E S O U R C E S 28 different redox pairs are occurring, it is not possible to measure a unique Eh for a particular geochemi- cal system (Stumm and Morgan, 1996). Slow redox reaction rates also complicate matters because in many natural systems many redox pairs are not in equilibrium and many of the reactions are not reversible. It can be seen in Figure 23 that while all water samples were observed to have measurable amounts of dissolved oxygen, most Eh values indicate an anaerobic system. The hatched area (710 mV < Eh < 814 mV) shows the range of Eh values for an aerobic system where organic matter is oxidized by aerobic respiration. For some of the high dissolved oxygen samples (dissolved oxygen >3 mg/L), Eh plots in this area where Eh is greater thatn 710 mV. As mentioned above, the large temporal variability of measured dissolved oxygen concentrations in some wells has implications for the mobilization of some potential contaminants, such as metals that may be related to the Gold King Mine Spill, due to the result\u00ad ing change in redox state. This topic will be discussed more below. Water Quality The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency water quality standards discussed in this section are provided simply for comparison of privately owned domes\u00ad tic well water samples and are not enforceable for private wells. According to water chemistry data for the measured constituents, all water samples exhib\u00ad ited chemical concentrations below the \u201cmaximum contaminant levels\u201d (MCLs) as defined by the EPA Figure 23. Redox ladder as shown in Langmuir (1997) shows impor\u00ad tant redox pairs for different Eh values. Box and whisker plots for all water samples collected for this study are divided into two categories based on the measured dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration in the sample. It should be noted that the low dissolved oxygen (DO <3 mg/L) and the high dissolved oxygen (DO >3 mg/L) categories in this figure describe individual samples, not the well categories described in the text. Therefore, many wells are represented in both categories. 800 600 400 200 0 -200 Low DO High DO Fe (OH)3 Fe2+ NO- 2 NO+ 4 NO- 2 NO+ 4 MnO2 Mn2+ O2(aq) H2O SO2 4 H2S(aq) NO- 3 N2(aq) SO2- 4 Fes2 S* H2S(aq) HCO- 3 CH4(aq) Figure 21.

For the following discussion, we evaluate groundwater quality by comparing water chemistry results to secondary maximum contaminant levels (SMCLs) as defined by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency secondary drinking water regula\u00ad tion, which is a non-enforceable guideline regarding cosmetic or aesthetic effects. While these contaminants are not health threatening, if present at levels above the SMCLs, these constituents may cause the water to appear cloudy or colored, or to taste or smell bad. Please see Appendix E for a more complete list of U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and New Mexico water quality standards and health adviso\u00ad ries. Constituents for which measured concentrations were observed to exceed the SMCLs include total dissolved solids (TDS), sulfate, chloride, iron, man\u00ad ganese and aluminum. Table 6 shows selected water chemistry data for all samples, and identifies indi\u00ad vidual analyses that showed chemical concentrations exceeding the SMCL for the analyte of interest. A complete summary of all water chemistry results are available in Appendix C. Most wells produced water with total dissolved solids concentrations exceeding the MCL of 500 mg/L, possibly resulting in mineral deposition in pipes and water heaters, colored water, and a salty taste. Total dissolved solids concentrations above the SMCL are common in groundwater in New Mexico, due to the dissolution of soluble minerals such as calcite and gypsum. Some wells that were sampled produced water with total dissolved solids concentra\u00ad tions well above 1000 mg/L, which can affect some crops if being used for irrigation. Sulfate concentra\u00ad tions exceeding the SMCL of 250 mg/L were also observed in many water samples. The sample with the highest total dissolved solids and sulfate concen\u00ad trations is from the well AR-0213. AR-0213 was also the only well that produced water with chloride and fluoride concentrations that exceed the SMCLs. AR-0213 and AR-0214, which are completed in the bedrock that underlies the alluvial aquifer, have total depths of 500 and 370 feet respectively and will be discussed in more detail below due to their distinct chemical signatures. For the metals manganese, iron, and aluminum, both dissolved and total concentrations are listed in Table 6. The total concentration includes the amount of the analyte that was in solution when the sample was collected and the amount of that analyte that was adsorbed onto particulates and colloids in the sample. The dissolved concentration only accounts for the portion of the analyte that was in solution when the sample was collected. Several wells produced water that exceeded the SMCL for iron and manganese. While manganese, by oral route, is considered one of the least toxic elements, some studies suggest that long-term exposure to manganese in drinking water may cause some adverse health effects (WHO, 2011). Most of these studies focused on drinking water with manganese concentrations that are at least an order of magnitude greater than those observed in this study. AR-0075 exhibited the highest manganese concentrations and consistently showed manganese concentrations that exceed the SMCL. Iron in drink\u00ad ing water poses no health threats (WHO, 2003). Measureable dissolved aluminum was detected in 50% of groundwater samples, with AR-0214 being the only well producing water with dissolved aluminum concentrations that exceed the SMCL of 0.05 mg/L. A total of 88% of groundwater samples exhibited measureable total aluminum,while only three wells (AR-0110, AR-0156, and AR-0214) had concentrations greater than the SMCL. With the exception of AR-0214, dissolved aluminum con\u00ad centrations in shallow groundwater are below or within the normal range for natural waters with near neutral pH values as reported by the WHO (2010), of between 0.001 and 0.05 mg/L. Water sampled from AR-0214 showed a significantly high dissolved aluminum concentration of 0.161 mg/L. The presence of measureable total aluminum in most water samples indicates potential for the dissolution of aluminum in groundwater in the Animas valley. However, with the observed pH values, this is unlikely. The effects of long-term exposure to dissolved aluminum in drink\u00ad ing water are debated. While some studies suggest the possibility of an association between Alzheimer disease and aluminum in groundwater, other studies have not produced the same results (WHO, 2010). Figure 24 shows the locations of wells that produced water that exceeded groundwater SMCLs for total dissolved solids, sulfate, total iron, total manganese and total aluminum. While SMCLs refer to dissolved constituents, we included total concen\u00ad trations for iron, manganese, and aluminum because the presence of colloidal or particulate forms of theses metals may indicate potential dissolution of these metals. Most of the wells that produce water with sulfate concentrations exceeding the SMCL are located south of Aztec. This spatial trend will be discussed more below.

Hardness, which is a result of the dissolution of minerals that contain calcium and magnesium, is not a health concern, but can be a nuisance by causing mineral buildup in plumbing and water heaters. General Water Chemistry The concentration of the major cations (sodium (Na), calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg) and potassium (K)) and anions (sulfate (SO4), bicarbonate (HCO3), and chloride (Cl)) in groundwater depends on the types of rocks or sediments that comprise the aquifer, the amount of time water spends in the aquifer, the length of the flow path, and the geochemical processes that are taking place. In this section we describe the major ion chemistry, identify spatial and temporal trends for the major cations and anions and other chemical constituents, and identify the different water types. Table 7 shows average concentrations of selected ions and other constituents for wells that were sampled multiple times during this study, with the exception of regional samples shown in Table 4, which were sampled only once. Spatial Variability\u2014Several spatial trends for groundwater chemistry were observed. Average total dissolved solids (TDS) concentrations in repeat samples show a weak trend of increasing values from the northeast to the southwest (down river) (Figure 25B). Sulfate concentrations show the same but stronger trend (Figure 25C). Figure 25A shows a very strong linear correlation between total dissolved solids and sulfate concentrations. Sulfate concentra\u00ad tion can be used as a proxy for total dissolved solids concentration and is the focus of the discussion about mixing processes below. Trends in the same direc\u00ad tion can be seen for other constituents as well (Figure 26A and B). Strontium concentrations increase in the downstream direction while barium concentrations decrease in the downstream direction. No spatial trend for chloride was observed (Figure 26C). Temporal changes in dissolved oxygen and total dissolved solids\u2014In the above discussion about field parameters, wells were categorized based on dissolved oxygen concentrations and the observed range in values measured in individual wells over the course of the study. Higher dissolved oxygen concentra\u00ad tions are likely due to the input of river water which is usually saturated with respect to oxygen due to being exposed to the atmosphere (see Table 5).

Areas in the aquifer that show a large range of dissolved oxygen concentrations over time are probably very dynamic with frequent periods of recharge by high dissolved oxygen river water. Specific conductance data in Table 3 and Table 5 indi\u00ad cate that river water has lower total dissolved solids concentrations than those observed in most ground\u00ad water in the study area. Therefore, the hypothesis that increases in dissolved oxygen concentrations in groundwater was due to the input of river water was tested by examining temporal changes in dissolved oxygen and total dissolved solids for mixed-dissolved oxygen wells. An inverse linear correlation was identified for some of the mixed-dissolved oxygen wells (Figure 27). However, many of these correlations were weak, and we did not observe this linear relationship for many of the mixed-dissolved oxygen wells. Time series graphs of total dissolved solids and dissolved oxygen for many of the mixed-dissolved oxygen wells Figure 27. Linear regressions for total dissolved solids (TDS) as a function of dissolved oxygen (DO) for selected wells show an inverse correlations. When dissolved oxygen concentrations in groundwater increase, total dissolved solids concentrations decrease.

Interestingly, for low-dissolved oxygen wells, slightly over 50% of coincident changes in total dissolved solids and dissolved oxygen between sampling events occurred in the opposite direction. If the causes of change in dissolved oxygen and total dissolved solids over time were not related, and the occurrence of the coincident changes in dissolved oxygen and total dissolved solids in opposite direction was random, we would expect to see this occur about 25% of the time. Therefore, temporal fluctuations in dissolved oxygen in groundwater are very likely indicative of oxygenated, lower total dissolved solids river water recharging the shallow aquifer in that area. These mixing processes are discussed below in detail. Water type\u2014The Piper diagram shown in Figure 31 is used to group different types of water based on relative concentrations of the major cations and anions. Data points shown on Figure 31 are average values for samples collected multiple times (black triangles). The two deeper wells, AR-0213 and AR-0214 are shown as red triangles and were only Figure 30. Analysis of the direction of change in dissolved oxygen (DO) and total dissolved solids (TDS) between sample events. An up-arrow indicates an increase; a down-arrow indicates a decrease; a dash indicates no change. Most increases in dissolved oxygen are accompanied by a decrease in total dissolved solids and vice versa for both mixed-dissolved oxygen wells and low-dissolved oxygen wells. This trend suggests that increases in dissolved oxygen concentrations in groundwater are usually due to the input of high-dissolved oxygen, low-total dissolved solids irrigation water. Figure 31.

On the ternary plot on the bottom left, which shows relative cation concentration, for all repeated samples calcium (Ca) is the dominant cation, accounting for more than 50% of equiva\u00ad lents per liter of cations. Data for AR-0213 and AR-0214 shows that the dominant cation is sodium (Na), which accounts for over 80% of cations. For the anions shown in the ternary plot on the right, almost all repeated samples exhibit relative chloride (Cl) concentrations of less than 10% and plot in a linear fashion between bicarbonate (HCO3) and sulfate (SO4), ranging from 67% bicarbonate to 75% sulfate. Again, AR-0213 and AR-0214 stand out with sulfate being the dominant anion. For AR-0213, sulfate accounts for over 90% of anions.

Therefore, the geochemical composition of groundwater can help to determine the type of rocks or sediments with which the water has interacted. As discussed above, the major ions present are calcium, bicarbonate, and sulfate, indicating the dissolu\u00ad tion of calcium carbonate (limestone, dolomite, or calcite cements) and gypsum. Figure 33 shows that for all water samples the main anions (sulfate and bicarbonate on the y-axis) and cations (calcium and magnesium on the x-axis) mostly control the charge balance of the solution, with the data plotting close to the 1:1 line. However, all data plots slightly above the 1:1 line, indicating a slight deficit of cations to maintain a charge balance. This observation is likely due to cation exchange, where sodium ions that are bound to clay mineral surfaces exchange with calcium and magnesium in solution. The presence of sodium and chloride in groundwater is usually primarily due to the dissolution of halite (NaCl), which has a molar ratio (Na/Cl) of 1, represented by the 1:1 line in Figure 34A, which shows sodium concentration as a function of chloride concentration. Almost all the data shows an excess of sodium relative to chloride. Figure 34B shows that the cation deficit shown in Figure 32. Location of wells, identified by their water type as defined by relative cation and anion concentrations. Figure 33 is roughly equal to the sodium excess, confirming the occurrence of cation exchange. Some of the observed excess sodium may also be a result of the mixing of the sodium sulfate water shown in Figure 31 and Figure 32. Geochemical modeling with PHREEQC (Packhurst and Appelo, 1999) was used to determine saturation indices for different minerals. Saturation indices for selected minerals based on average groundwater chemistry data are included in Table 8. Most groundwater sampled ranged from saturated to super-saturated with respect to calcite, aragonite, dolomite, barite, and quartz. This indicates that this water cannot dissolve these minerals and can poten\u00ad tially precipitate them. Almost all water samples were under-saturated with respect to gypsum, indicating the potential to dissolve gypsum. Saturation indices for minerals not shown in Table 8 are less than zero, indicating under-saturation. Wells AR-0213 and AR-0214, both of which appear to produce water from bedrock underly\u00ad ing alluvial sediments, are chemically distinct as high-TDS sodium-sulfate type waters. These water samples are also distinct isotopically and are much older than any other waters sampled in the study area, as will be discussed below. High total dissolved solids sodium-sulfate type water is found in the Nacimiento, Ojo Alamo, and Animas Formations (Phillips et al., 1989; Kelley et al., 2014). Phillips et al. (1989) sampled water from the Ojo Alamo and Nacimiento Formations that is chemically similar to that sampled from AR-0213 and AR-0214, with high Figure 33. Graph of bicarbonate and sulfate vs. calcium and mag\u00ad nesium helps to evaluate controls on water chemistry. Data that plots along the 1:1 line indicates that the dissolution of limestone, dolomite, and gypsum are the primary factors controlling the major ion chemistry. Data that plots slightly above the 1:1 line indicates a cation deficit for maintaining a charge balance. The unit milliequivalent per liter is the amount of millimoles per liter multiplied by the valence of the ion. 39 G R O U N D W A T E R M O N I T O R I N G A L O N G T H E A N I M A S R I V E R , N M sulfate and sodium and low calcium and magnesium. Geochemical modeling showed that the chemical evolution of this water involved the dissolution of gypsum and sodium/calcium ion exchange that drove calcite into the dissolution. These processes cause sulfate and sodium to build up and for calcium to be depleted due to cation exchange. Mixing processes\u2014explained by progressive water/ mineral interactions that cause the water chemistry to evolve over time resulting in the observed sodium- sulfate water, as described by Phillips et al. (1989). However, the mixing of the high-total dissolved solids, sodium \u2013 sulfate water and fresher calcium \u2013 bicarbonate water could also explain the observed trend.

While the timing of these observed coincidental changes in total dissolved solids and dis\u00ad solved oxygen varies from well to well, it appears to happen slightly more often between March and June, indicative of recharge during irrigation season. It is seen in Figure 35 that there is an inverse relationship between the observed range in dissolved oxygen con\u00ad centrations in groundwater and relative sulfate con\u00ad centrations. High dissolved oxygen wells and mixed dissolved oxygen wells with the highest dissolved oxygen concentrations, which have more direct river input, exhibit low relative sulfate concentrations (as a proportion of anions). The range in observed dissolved oxygen concentrations decreases as rela\u00ad tive sulfate concentrations increase towards values N E W M E X I C O B U R E A U O F G E O L O G Y A N D M I N E R A L R E S O U R C E S 40 observed in AR-0213. This observation supports the hypothesis that the linear trend observed for anions in the piper diagram (Figure 31), which cor\u00ad relates to the spatial trends observed for sulfate and total dissolved solids (Figure 25), is a result of the mixing of fresher water that ultimately originates as river water and high-TDS sodium-sulfate waters observed in the Nacimiento Formation at depths between 300 and 500 feet. We modeled the mixing of fresh calcium-bicar\u00ad bonate type river water and high-total dissolved solids sodium-sulfate groundwater in PHREEQC. Well AR-0212, which had one of the lowest sulfate concentrations, was used as the fresh water end- member and AR-0213 water was used as the high- total dissolved solids endmember. The modeled endmembers based on our water chemistry data were combined at different mixing proportions. The resulting modeled mixtures were equilibrated with respect to calcite and barite. The mixing curve shown in Figure 36 plots the relative sulfate concentration as a function of the absolute sulfate concentration. Almost all of the groundwater chemistry data fits this curve remarkably well. This mixing model suggests that the spatial trend observed for sulfate with increasing concentrations to the southwest (Figure 25) is due to an increased input of regional high-total dissolved solids sodium-sulfate water in the southwest portion of the study area, south of Aztec. For the minor constituents of barium and strontium, which also exhibit the spatial trend in the same direction (Figure 26), groundwater concentrations as a function of relative sulfate concentrations follow the basic shape of the mixing curve, but mostly plot above the mixing line (Figure 37, Figure 38). For barium, most water samples are super saturated with respect to barite. The fresh water endmember on the mixing model shows the concentration that most of the low-sulfate groundwa\u00ad ter would exhibit if the solution was at equilibrium with respect to barite. For chloride, which does not exhibit a spatial trend (Figure 26), but usually serves as a conservative tracer, most groundwater concentra\u00ad tions plot slightly above the mixing line (Figure 39). While this mixing trend appears to be the primary process that defines the major ion concentrations in groundwater in the study area, chloride, which makes up a small proportion of anions in both endmembers, appears to be affected by another process. Excess barium, strontium, and chloride concentrations that cannot be explained by the two endmember mixing model presented, suggest that there is likely at least Figure 35. Dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations plotted as a function of relative sulfate (SO4) concentrations. This graph shows that water from high dissolved oxygen wells and mixed dissolved oxygen wells with the largest observed range in dissolved oxygen concentrations exhibit lower relative sulfate concentrations.

It should be noted that AR-0075 exhibits much higher chloride and barium concentrations than is seen in other wells. AR-0112 also shows significantly higher chloride concentra\u00ad tions than most other wells. We speculate that there is a third mixing endmember that is characterized by high-total dissolved solids concentrations, with sodium and chloride as the major ions, which may be contributing relatively small amounts of water to the shallow aquifer system. Trace metals and redox reactions Redox conditions in an aquifer affect speciation and therefore the solubility of many metals. The dynamic nature of this shallow aquifer due to irrigation and groundwater/surface water interactions as demon\u00ad strated by the observed temporal dissolved oxygen concentrations in many wells, has implications for the mobilization of some metals of concern into the groundwater, possibly related to the Gold King Mine spill. We analyzed water samples for the following trace metals: silver (Ag), aluminum (Al), arsenic (As), boron (B), barium (Ba), beryllium (Be), cadmium (Cd), cobalt (Co), chromium (Cr), copper (Cu), iron (Fe), mercury (Hg), lithium (Li), manganese (Mn), molybdenum (Mo), nickel (Ni), lead (Pb), antimony (Sb), selenium (Se), tin (Sn), strontium (Sr), thorium (Th), titanium (Ti), uranium (U), vanadium (V), and zinc (Zn). Results for all these analyses can be seen in Appendix C. For most of these metals, analysis results were below the reporting limit for nearly all the samples. The Gold King Mine spill of 2015 exhibited elevated levels iron, aluminum, manganese, lead, copper, arsenic, zinc, cadmium, and mercury (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2016). During the course of the 2 years of sampling for this project after the spill, there does not appear to be any con\u00ad sistent increase to these constituents. This discussion focuses on iron, manganese, and aluminum, which observed in some water samples to be above SMCLs, as discussed above (Figure 24). For iron, unlike most of the other cations, the total concentrations which include the dissolved constituent and solid or adsorbed phase, were often observed to be much higher than just the dissolved concentrations (Figure 40). We observe this trend more so at lower dissolved oxygen concentrations and to a slightly larger degree for the mixed dis\u00ad solved oxygen wells. The temporal fluctuation of redox conditions due to changes in dissolved oxygen concentrations likely results in the dissolution and precipitation of iron hydroxides at lower and higher Eh values, respectively.

The highest man\u00ad ganese concentrations shown in Figure 44, ranging from 2 to over 6.5 mg/L is from the well AR-0075, which stands out in many ways geochemically. 45 G R O U N D W A T E R M O N I T O R I N G A L O N G T H E A N I M A S R I V E R , N M mentioned above, AR-0213 and AR-0214 are com\u00ad pleted in bedrock (likely the Nacimiento Formation) and produce water that is high in total dissolved solids and is characterized by a sodium-sulfate water type, which is distinct from all water samples collected in the alluvial aquifer. The observed dissolved alumi\u00ad num may be due to the dissolution of aluminosilicate minerals in the San Jose or Nacimiento Formations, suggesting this deeper water that is mixing with the shallow groundwater is a source of aluminum. However, it should be pointed out that dissolved aluminum in AR-0213 was below the reporting limit. It is not surprising that dissolved aluminum was not detected in any of the other groundwater samples, as aluminum minerals are relatively insoluble at near neutral pHs. The measurable total aluminum in sev\u00ad eral samples indicates a source of aluminum. While aluminosilicates in the aquifer may be the source, it is Figure 44. Eh-pH diagram for Mn-O-H2O system along with data shows that most water samples plot in the stability field for dissolved manganese (Mn2+). Figure 43. Total manganese (Mn) as a function of dissolved manganese shows that most manganese in groundwater is in the dissolved phase. Figure 45.

Aluminum and iron were the dominant metals in the Gold King Mine plume (Sullivan et al., 2017). Stable Isotopes of Hydrogen and Oxygen The stable isotopes of oxygen and hydrogen are use\u00ad ful tools for tracing the hydrologic cycle. The isotopic composition of a water sample refers to the ratio of the heavier isotopes to the lighter isotopes (R) for the hydrogen and oxygen that make up the water mol\u00ad ecules. Because these stable isotopes are part of the water molecule, small variations in these ratios act as labels that allow tracking of waters with different stable isotopic signatures. All isotopic compositions in this report are presented as relative concentrations, or the per mil deviation of R of a sample from R of a standard (VSMOW) shown in the equation below: It is useful to plot stable isotope data on a \u03b4D vs \u03b418O graph, as shown in Figure 46. In general, most precipitation plots on or near the global meteoric water line (GMWL) with a slope of 8 and a deuterium excess (y-intercept) of 10 as demonstrated by Craig (1961). However, the linear trend that characterizes local precipitation in a specific area may deviate from the GMWL with a similar slope but a different deuterium excess. Isotopic characterization of local precipitation is often very useful for identifying groundwater recharge sources and mechanisms. We found no local meteoric water lines (LMWL) that had been identified for this specific region. We sampled the Animas River at three locations within the study area during the March, June, and October 2016, and January 2017 sampling events (Figure 46). We collected samples from the river for stable isotopic analysis at many more locations (Figure 16) during the March and June 2017 sampling events. The stable isotopic compositions of river samples collected in June 2017, which include sample loca\u00ad tions in Colorado, exhibit an evaporation line that shows the isotopic evolution of spring runoff water as it evaporates, with the lightest values at the head\u00ad waters near Silverton, and the heaviest values near Farmington. Assuming the water collected near the headwaters represents non-evaporated snowmelt, an assumed LMWL for the winter precipitation in the San Juan Mountains was estimated with a slope of 8 that intersected the isotopically lightest river samples. The resulting deuterium excess is 17, which is similar to that of the LMWL identified in the Sacramento Mountains in southern New Mexico by Newton et al. (2012).

For the purpose of this study, this is a reason\u00ad able estimation of the LMWL, but for future work, it would be worth the effort to construct a LMWL for the high San Juan Mountains near Silverton using stable isotope data for precipitation. Other river samples collected at different times also plot on or near the evaporation line. Deviation from the observed evaporation line likely represents evaporation under slightly different conditions, such as temperature and relative humidity. Therefore, the isotopic composition of all river samples is likely due to evaporation of winter precipitation in the San Juan Mountains. During the March and January 2016 and March 2017 sampling events, the river was probably at baseflow conditions where river water is primarily derived from groundwater discharge upstream of the study area. Therefore, the stable isotopic composition of groundwater to the north is similar to that of river water. The evaporative signature of groundwater to the north is due to irrigation on the Animas valley floodplain all along the river. Robson and Wright (1995) concluded that in the Florida Mesa area just south of Durango, the primary recharge source to the shallow alluvial aquifer was irrigation water. Water level fluctuations in the study area discussed above, where water levels increase during irrigation season and decrease during the winter indicate that irrigation Rsample - Rstandard Rstandard *1000\u2030 \u03b4 = 47 G R O U N D W A T E R M O N I T O R I N G A L O N G T H E A N I M A S R I V E R , N M Figure 47. The average stable isotopic compositions of most ground\u00ad water plots along or near the river evaporation line. There may be mix\u00ad ing of evaporated river water and regional water from the Nacimiento Formation (AR-0213, AR-0214). is an important recharge source for the shallow allu\u00ad vial aquifer in New Mexico also. Average stable isotopic data for almost all groundwater samples plot on or near the evaporation line (Figure 47). As was seen with the water chem\u00ad istry, AR-0213 and AR-0214 also exhibit distinct stable isotopic compositions with much lighter or more negative values. These are old waters from the Nacimiento/Ojo Alamo aquifer which are described by Phillips et al. (1986). The anomalously light isotopic signature is indicative of a cooler wetter climate during the Pleistocene. As with the chemistry data, there is also some isotopic evidence of mixing of this regional groundwater and the shallow irriga\u00ad tion recharge (Figure 48). The trend is subtle due to the fact that an evaporation trend, which increases the isotopic ratio, dominantly controls the isotopic composition of the shallow groundwater. With the exception on one well (AR-0031), water with a relative sulfate concentrations greater than 0.6 (which is greater than 5% mixing of Na-SO4 water) (Figure 36), exhibit \u03b4D values less than -100\u2030 and as low as -104\u2030. For relative sulfate concentrations less than 0.6, while \u03b4D values exhibit a large range of values many samples have values greater than -100\u2030. Well AR-0031 shows the highest degree of enrichment due to evaporation. Groundwater age We collected nine water samples for tritium and carbon-14 analysis during the March 2017 sampling event. In addition to the 4 regional wells (Table 4), five other wells in the shallow alluvial aquifer were chosen mainly to get a fairly uniform coverage across the study area. Tritium and carbon-14 data is shown in Table 9 and Figure 49. Figure 48. Stable isotope \u03b4D values for groundwater as a function of relative sulfate con\u00ad centration.

Tritium concentration is measured in Tritium Units (TU), where one TU indicates a tritium-hydrogen atomic ratio of 10\u201318. The tritium content of precipitation varies spatially and tempo\u00ad rally, with average values in the Southwestern U.S. and Mexico ranging from 2 to 10 TU (Eastoe et al., 2012). Between 1991 and 2005, the tritium content of precipitation in Albuquerque, NM ranged from 4.5 to 19.1 TU, with an average of 8.8 TU (IAEA/ WMO, 2017). Newton et al. (2012) observed tritium concentrations in precipitation in the Sacramento Mountains in southern New Mexico to range from 3 to 10 TU. Assuming initial tritium concentrations in snow melt in the San Juan Mountains are similar to those discussed above, tritium in groundwater can be used to estimate a qualitative age with the general interpretation that groundwater with tritium concen\u00ad trations between 5 and 10 TU is modern water that is less than 10 years old. All water samples except AR-0213 and AR-0214 have tritium concentrations between 5 and 7 TU, indicative of modern water. AR-0213 and AR-0214 show tritium values of zero and 0.34 TU respectively, indicating that that water is older than 50 years. Carbon-14 ages shown in Figure 49B are appar\u00ad ent ages. We did not attempt to correct for hydro\u00ad geologic processes such as carbonate dissolution that usually results in apparent ages that are older than the actual age of the water. For the purpose of this study, apparent carbon-14 ages are sufficient to confirm the two mixing endmembers as identified by the major ion distribution and tritium ages. Wells AR-0213 and AR-0214 show apparent carbon-14 ages of 19,630 and 15,100 years before present (YBP), respectively. The older water collected from the Nacimiento/Ojo Alamo aquifer with anomalously light isotopic signatures by Phillips et al. (1989) exhibited corrected carbon-14 ages ranging from 7,000 to 35,000 YBP. Therefore, while the corrected ages for AR-0213 and AR-0214 may be significantly younger than apparent ages, they are obviously still much older than all other water samples, which have apparent carbon-14 ranging from 910 to 2,830 YBP. With the observed high tritium content and apparent carbon-14 dates for all shallow groundwater samples analyzed for carbon-14, mixing of modern fresh water with a small amount of high total dissolved sol\u00ad ids older water appears to be a very common process in this aquifer. This conceptual model of the hydrologic system in Animas Valley in Northern New Mexico identifies many of the different features, both on the sur\u00ad face and in the subsurface that affect the hydrologic cycle, where rain and snow, primarily in the San Juan Mountains moves through the streams and aquifers and eventually back to the atmosphere as water vapor. Snow in the mountains melts in the late spring, filling the mountains streams with fresh water that feeds the Animas River in Colorado and flows through northeastern New Mexico. Water in the river is used as drinking water for local communities for local industry, and farmers use it to irrigate their crops. Irrigation water that is not used by vegetation infiltrates into the subsurface to recharge the shallow aquifer that is made up of gravel, sand, silt, and clay sediments. Some snow and rain from the San Juan Mountains that is thousands of years old also contributes to the shallow groundwater by flowing upwards from the bedrock aquifer that lies below the alluvium. Other recharge sources to the shallow groundwater include local precipitation and water in ephemeral streams and tributaries to the Animas River, and in some areas, water from the Animas infiltrates into the aquifer directly from the river. Groundwater in the shallow aquifer flows southwest (down stream) and toward the river and ultimately discharges into the river. Along its flow path, groundwater is intercepted by wells that produce water for irrigation and domestic use and by riparian vegetation. Water in the Animas feeds the San Juan River near Farmington, New Mexico, which flows into Lake Powell in Utah. Figure 50. Piper diagram shows chemistry data for average groundwa\u00ad ter compositions along with Animas River samples collected by the U.S. Geological Survey in 2016 (Blake et al., 2017). 51 G R O U N D W A T E R M O N I T O R I N G A L O N G T H E A N I M A S R I V E R , N M Hydrogeologic Conceptual Model Recharge G roundwater recharge is the process by which water moves from the surface into an aquifer.

Continuous measurements of water levels and specific conductance in some wells (Figure 20) not only show an increase in the water level at the begin\u00ad ning of irrigation season, but a decrease in specific conductance, which indicates the input of river water which generally exhibits significantly lower specific conductance values than that of groundwater. As discussed above, observed increases in dissolved oxygen with coincident decreases in total dissolved solids indicate the input of river water in many wells. While there may be some river water moving directly from the river into the groundwater system, irrigation return flow is the dominant process by which river water recharges the shallow aquifer. Water chemistry supports the identification of the fresh water mixing endmember as ultimately being river water. Water chemistry for river water sampled by the U.S. Geological Survey in 2016 (Blake et al., 2017) is shown on a Piper diagram and the sulfate mixing curve in Figure 50 and Figure 51, respectively. On the anion ternary diagram, river water plots along the linear trend observed for groundwater towards the fresh calcium-bicarbonate endmember but does not exhibit the highest relative bicarbonate concentra\u00ad tions. Likewise, in Figure 51, river samples plot near the mixing line close to the fresh water endmember but some groundwater shows smaller relative sulfate concentrations. The general chemistry for river water likely shows significant variability seasonably and from year to year due to variations in the relative pro\u00ad portions of groundwater discharge, annual snowmelt, or monsoon rains that may contribute to the total river discharge. Irrigation practices all along the Animas River from Durango to Farmington likely account for most groundwater recharge to the shallow alluvial aquifer. Robson and Wright (1995) concluded that irrigation water is the largest source of recharge in La Plata County, Colorado, along the Animas and Florida Rivers, just south of Durango. As will be discussed I V . D I S C U S S I O N Figure 51.

N E W M E X I C O B U R E A U O F G E O L O G Y A N D M I N E R A L R E S O U R C E S 52 below, groundwater in the shallow aquifer flows mostly from northeast to southwest and toward the river. Groundwater that discharges to the river all along the Animas is a mixture of river water from the current or previous irrigation season and river water from past irrigation seasons. At any given time, river water therefore contains some proportion of irrigation return flow that includes irrigation water from past irrigation seasons. River water exhibits the freshest water with the smallest proportion of irriga\u00ad tion return flow during the spring runoff when the river stage is high due to snowmelt from the high San Juan Mountains making its way to the Animas River via mountain streams. This trend can be seen in the specific conductance measurements for river water shown in Table 5. Groundwater recharge of irrigation water likely occurs along many of the irrigation canals and ditches and in agricultural fields, where this water is applied to water crops. Irrigation water infiltrates through the soil and reaches the water table fairly quickly, increas\u00ad ing groundwater almost immediately after irrigation season begins. Regional groundwater recharge\u2014The mixing curve shown in Figure 51 includes data for over 100 groundwater samples collected by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and New Mexico Environment Department during August 2015 imme\u00ad diately after the Gold King Mine spill. This mixing model fits the data remarkably well and can explain the major ion distribution for almost all shallow groundwater in the entire study area. An increase in the relative sulfate concentration indicates an increase in the mixing proportion of older regional groundwa\u00ad ter from the Nacimiento/Ojo Alamo aquifer. Recharge to the Nacimiento/San Jose/Animas Formation aquifers primarily occurs at the edge of the San Juan Basin near Durango, CO (Figure 52). It takes groundwater thousands of years to flow along deep flow paths from this recharge area to where it was sampled near Farmington. Spatial trends observed for several con\u00ad stituents, including sulfate and total dissolved solids (Figure 25), suggest that the relative contribution of this regional groundwater increases to the southwest (downstream). Figure 52 shows that average relative sulfate concentrations are fairly constant between the state border and Aztec.

Local recharge includes the infiltration of precipita\u00ad tion through unconsolidated sediments in the Animas Valley and focused recharge through the bottoms of arroyos and ephemeral tributaries to the Animas dur\u00ad ing flash floods. Groundwater flow directions The general groundwater flow direction, as shown by the water table contour map (Figure 10), is toward the river. Groundwater flows down gradient, perpen\u00ad dicular to water table contours. The overall shape of the water table contours in the valley form a \u2018V\u2019 pointing upstream. This indicates groundwater from the surrounding alluvial aquifer flows toward the river, resulting in what appears to be a typical gain\u00ad ing stream. However, by looking at the water levels in close proximity to the river, we found that the water table gradient is nearly flat in close proximity to the river. We observed that the water levels in some wells near the river during the winter and spring are below river elevation (wells highlighted in red in Figure 10). This suggests that the river could add water to the groundwater (a losing river). By examining a losing reach and refining the water table contours, we can better understand the groundwater flow direction and magnitude during periods of the year where the river is losing water to the alluvial aquifer by preforming Darcy flow calculations. Darcy flow calculations\u2014To estimate the distance from the river that wells may be impacted directly by water infiltrating from the river, we focused on a small portion of the water table map that appears to exhibit losing conditions. For this analysis we zoom in on AR-0059 and AR-0060, located 1.5 miles northeast of Aztec, on the west side of the river. From this analysis we can calculate radius of impact that Figure 52. Schematic regional cross sections showing groundwater flowpaths in regional bedrock. Regional groundwater recharge to the Nacimiento/Ojo Alamo/San Jose aquifer occurs in the San Juan Mountains near Durango, at the northern edge of the San Juan Basin. Increased sulfate and total dissolved solids concentrations in shallow groundwater south of Aztec are due to the upwelling of old sodium-sulfate regional groundwater from the Nacimiento/Ojo Alamo aquifer as a result of the structure of the San Juan Basin. The thinning of this deeper aquifer forces regional groundwater into the shallow alluvial aquifer (which overlies the bedrock, but is not shown on this image). It should be noted that the horizontal distances shown on the NM cross-section (bottom) are river miles, resulting in a larger relative distance than is shown in the larger-scale cross-section (top). Red points refer to sulfate concentrations as a function, of the total anions, referring to the right axis on lower image.

Based on LiDAR model\u00ad ing of the river stage, combined with U.S. Geological Survey gauging stations, we modeled the river stage in the Animas River during the groundwater level mea\u00ad surement periods. Using the modeled river stage and the measured groundwater level elevations we were able draw fine scale water table contours and calcu\u00ad late the water table gradient. With this a gradient and an estimate of hydraulic conductivity we can perform Darcy flow calculations to estimate to what extent surface water could infiltrate into the alluvial aquifer (Figure 53). Darcy flow (equation 1) is an equation used to estimate groundwater flow rates: (1) where q is specific discharge (volumetric flow rate per unit cross-sectional area, ft/day), is the hydraulic gradient (change in water level between the river and the well, over the distance along the flow path, \u0394s), and k is the hydraulic conductivity. For this cal\u00ad culation, we assumed a hydraulic conductivity of 100 ft/day, which is a typical value for clean sand (Freeze and Cherry, 1979). We estimated that the specific dis\u00ad charge from the river in January was approximately 0.6 ft/day. To determine the velocity that water flows, the specific discharge (q) is divided by the porosity, which as assumed to be 0.3. In the given example, the groundwater velocity away from the river dur\u00ad ing the winter is roughly 2 feet per day. Water levels in wells near the river appear to be losing primarily during the non-irrigation season (~9 weeks). At most, the river water can flow roughly 130 feet along its flow path from the river before the gradient reverses, switching to a gaining river during the irrigation season, and groundwater begins to flow back toward the river.

Analysis of U.S. Geological Survey stream dis\u00ad charge data\u2014To estimate the degree to which the Animas River is a gaining river we used the U.S. Geological Survey flow gauges located in the study area to estimate the amount of water that diffusely discharges along the stream bed. There are three U.S. Geological Survey stream gauges along the Animas River in the study area. The Farmington gauge (09364500) is located roughly 1.5 miles upstream of the confluence with the San Juan River. The Aztec gauge (09364010) is located 1.8 miles downstream of the Highway 516 Bridge in Aztec, NM. The Cedar Hill gauge (09363500) is located in Colorado, 2.7 miles north of the state line. Using stream flow data recorded at these locations dating back over the past 27 years, we compared stream flow between the gauges. To best understand the degree to which the river is gaining we looked at the difference in flow between the gauges during the winter, when the irrigation ditches were dry. Using the irrigation ditch flow records reported by the NM Office of the State Engineer (meas.ose.state.nm.us), we found that all of the ditches along this reach are shut off by the second week of November, and are not flowing again until early March. The daily average flow differ\u00ad ence between each pair of gauges was found first. The average flow difference between gauges over the past 27 years was then averaged based on its given Figure 53. View of a losing reach in January 2016 located 1.5 miles northeast of Aztec. This map is used to determine the gradient and direction of groundwater flow for the calculation of the Darcy flow. \u0394h \u0394s \u00b7 k q = \u0394h \u0394h \u0394s 55 G R O U N D W A T E R M O N I T O R I N G A L O N G T H E A N I M A S R I V E R , N M week (1\u201352) to understand the annual fluctuations (Figure 54). In the north, between the Cedar Hill and Aztec gauges (during the winter/non-irrigation period) the river was gaining on average 0.85 cubic feet per second per mile. In the south, between the Aztec and Farmington gauges the river was gaining 0.99 cubic feet per second per mile. This supports the water table maps and the assumption that the Animas River between the Colorado boarder and Farmington is a gaining reach. Additionally, the northern reach, between Cedar Hill and Aztec, where we identified zones that were more susceptible to losing condi\u00ad tions, showed slightly less gaining conditions than the southern reach. In total, during winter months, the Animas River gains, on average, 27 cfs as it flows through the study area. This represents a 10% increase in flow to the river supported by groundwa\u00ad ter flow during winter months. Groundwater/surface water interactions While it is clear the majority of river water that recharges the shallow aquifer is irrigation water, there is evidence of river water infiltrating directly from the river to the aquifer. As discussed above, we have identified a few localized areas where hydraulic gradients between the water table and the river stage indicate losing conditions at some times (Figure 10 and Figure 11). Figure 19 shows continuous water level and specific conductance data for AR-0075, which is less than 10 feet from the river. This well exhibits a river-stage-controlled type hydrograph and shows a decrease in specific conductance that cor\u00ad relates with high river stages associated with spring runoff, beginning in March 2017. This indicates that this low specific conductance water is likely coming directly from the river. Water level fluctuations in river-stage-controlled type wells as determined by hydrograph characteris\u00ad tics (Figure 13) are highly correlated with river stage. However, this correlation does not conclusively indi\u00ad cate the actual input of river water into the aquifer in these areas, which occur all along the Animas River. The water level fluctuations that correlate to river stage may be due to a pressure response where the groundwater levels increase or decrease to maintain a relatively constant hydraulic gradient with respect to the river. We examined dissolved oxygen ranges for both river-stage-controlled and irrigation-controlled type wells to assess the mechanism that controlled ground\u00ad water level fluctuations (Figure 55). As discussed above, wells that exhibit a high range in dissolved oxygen concentrations over time represent a dynamic system and is the result of frequent events where oxygenated river water mixes with water in the aqui\u00ad fer in that area. For the river-stage-controlled type, and mixed dissolved oxygen wells, we observe a high dissolved oxygen range for wells within 300 feet of the river with the dissolved oxygen range decreasing with increased distance from the river. This trend suggests that for those wells, the observed water level increases were likely due to the actual input of river water and not a pressure response. For Figure 54.

For irrigation controlled type wells, which are observed to be at much farther distances from the river than river-stage- controlled type wells, mixed dissolved oxygen wells show relatively high dissolved oxygen ranges with no correlation with distance from the river. This is expected because irrigation is the active application of water to ditches and fields, and the distance from the river is not a controlling factor in this process. For the river-stage-controlled type wells, the movement of water from the river to the aquifer depends on the hydraulic gradient, which is a function of distance from the river, and the hydraulic conductivity. These observations suggest that although groundwater levels are usually higher than river stage, river water does infiltrate directly into the aquifer in some areas at some times. According to the Darcy flow calcu\u00ad lations discussed above and the data presented in Figure 55, wells in close proximity (< 300 feet) of the river are at risk of pumping water that has infiltrated into the aquifer directly from the river. Potential Groundwater Contamination L ong before mining occurred in the headwaters of the Animas River, fractures and faults, caused by a collapsed caldera, served as conduits for warm mineral rich waters. Mining in the headwaters of the Animas River began in the 1860s when prospectors found rich ore deposits in the mountains surrounding Silverton, CO. Even before mining began, the springs emerging from the upper reaches of the Animas exhibited signs of acid drainage, as observed by 9,000 year old radiocarbon dates on ferricrete deposits in the Cement Creek drainage (Yager et al., 2016). Mining in the mountains served to greatly enhance the exposed surface area of the rocks in the moun\u00ad tains, allowing for more rapid oxidation and release of the minerals. The mine-waste rock piles that were deposited at the mouth of the mines consist of crushed rock that also serves as a source from which minerals are leached. After mining in the area ended, steps were taken to reduce the concentrations of leachate that drains from the abandoned mines. Bulkheads were installed at the entrance to several of the larger mines and tun\u00ad nels, leading the mines to fill with groundwater. By Figure 55. Observed range in dissolved oxygen concentrations as a function of distance from the river for river-stage-controlled and irrigation- controlled wells as determined by hydrograph characteristics. 57 G R O U N D W A T E R M O N I T O R I N G A L O N G T H E A N I M A S R I V E R , N M flooding the mine works, the exposed rock surfaces of the mines are no longer able to oxidize as readily, reducing the acid concentration of the leachate. The spill that occurred in August 2015 resulted from an earthen barrier in the Level 7 adit of the Gold King Mine being inadvertently breached. The water in the mine rapidly drained. The torrent of water that escaped as a result of the breach quickly eroded the waste rock pile outside of the mine. As result, roughly 490,000 kg (540 tons) of sediment was released during the Gold King Mine spill (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2016). The sedi\u00ad ment associated with the spill was differentiated from the existing background contamination by the elevated lead to aluminum ratio (Pb:Al). This sig\u00ad nature is an indication of the spill, but not the Gold King Mine. Downstream, in New Mexico, irrigation ditch operators reacted quickly and, to the extent pos\u00ad sible, the irrigation network was closed during the spill, preventing the sediment and mine water from entering the ditches. As has been demonstrated, the irrigation network is responsible for a signifi\u00ad cant portion of the recharge that enters the alluvial aquifer. Following the initial plume from Gold King Mine, the irrigation ditches were reopened. During the initial spill, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency estimates that only 10% of the sediment load was transported past Farmington, depositing roughly 432,000 kg (476 tons) of sediment in the Animas River (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2016). The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency reports that the sediment deposited during the spill did not remain stationary. The first major transport of sediment occurred during a fall storm that resulted in sufficient discharge to mobilize some of the sedi\u00ad ments. The majority of the sediments, however, were transported the following year during the spring runoff floods due to the snow melting in the San Juan Mountains, which began in mid-May and contin\u00ad ued through June (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2016). As the irrigation ditches were open during both of these secondary transport events, it is possible that some Gold King Mine sediments were transported into the ditches. While the Gold King Mine spill constituted a significant ecological disaster, it was by no means the largest mine spill in the Animas River (Church et al., 2007). In fact, it is estimated that the 48 historic mines/ mine\u2013related sources in the headwaters of the Animas River discharge roughly 5.4 million gallons of acid mine drainage per day (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2016). Dissolved and colloidal metals\u2014Manganese and iron are the only two dissolved metals in the shal\u00ad low groundwater that we observed at concentrations that exceed U.S. Environmental Protection Agency secondary maximum contaminant levels.

Dissolved and colloidal metals\u2014Manganese and iron are the only two dissolved metals in the shal\u00ad low groundwater that we observed at concentrations that exceed U.S. Environmental Protection Agency secondary maximum contaminant levels. As discussed above, these high iron and manganese concentrations appear to be associated with low Eh values (Figure 41 and Figure 45). Although the primary recharge source, which is river water via irrigation, is well oxygenated, the measured Eh values and the presence of dissolved manganese in most wells indi\u00ad cates that the oxygen is consumed quickly, resulting in manganese oxides and iron hydroxides being the main redox buffers. It is difficult to determine the source of the iron and manganese. Water in the Animas River has been observed with high iron and manganese total concentrations (most is likely adsorbed onto col\u00ad loids and other particulates) (Blake et al., 2017), and these metals could originate from the headwaters and tributaries, such as Cement Creek and Mineral Creek (Church et al., 2007). However, they are also present in the aquifer sediments. The alluvial aqui\u00ad fer was derived from the erosion of Ojo Alamo and Nacimiento Formations that outcrop adjacent to the Animas Valley at higher elevations. These formations are made up of mostly fluvial sediments, and both iron and manganese are ubiquitous in these types of environments. Therefore, the spatial distribution of these high iron and manganese waters may be controlled by the location where these minerals were concentrated when deposited, both within the alluvial sediments and sediments deposited in the irrigation ditches and canals during irrigation season. We must also consider the spatial distribution of reductants, such as organic matter, septic tank con\u00ad tamination, and quite possibly hydrocarbons, such as gas and oil. Of all wells sampled in the shallow aqui\u00ad fer, AR-0075 exhibits some of the lowest Eh values, ranging from 86 to 136 millivolts and contains the highest concentrations of iron and manganese by far, averaging 2.3 and 4.5 mg/L, respectively. Relatively high barium and chloride concentrations (Figure 37 and Figure 39) were also observed in the water produced by this well. These characteristics may sug\u00ad gest that the hypothesized third mixing endmember discussed above is a brine that may be associated with oil or gas in underlying geologic units. The hypothesized third mixing endmember is likely characterized by high chloride and low sulfate concentrations so that small additions of this brine to the shallow aquifer will significantly increase chloride concentrations without affecting the sulfate N E W M E X I C O B U R E A U O F G E O L O G Y A N D M I N E R A L R E S O U R C E S 58 content, which is controlled by the addition high sulfate groundwater from the Nacimiento Formation. The mixing model described above predicts signifi\u00ad cantly lower barium and strontium concentrations than were observed, suggesting the third mixing component is relatively high in barium and stront- ium. Some brines associated with gas wells in Pennsylvania have been observed with high chloride, barium, and strontium and low sulfate concentra- tions (Dresel and Rose, 2010). Kelley et al. (2014) reviewed water chemistry data from the U.S. Geological Survey online produced waters database, and reported high total dissolved solids sodium-chlo\u00ad ride type produced water in Cretaceous rocks such as the Pictured Cliffs and Cliff House Sandstones in the San Juan Basin. Chafin (1994) found methane at concentrations that exceeded the reporting limit of 0.005 mg/L in 70 of 205 groundwater samples in the Animas River Valley in Colorado and New Mexico. Potential sources of dissolved methane included some biogenic gas from the Animas and Nacimiento Formations but mostly thermogenic gas from deep reservoirs such as the Dakota Sandstone and the Mesaverde Group. The upper Fruitland Formation and Kirtland Shale could also account for some of this observed methane in groundwater. Chafin (1994) concluded that natural leakage through fractures was possible, but manmade conduits probably account for most upward move\u00ad ment of gas to the shallow aquifer. It is likely that any hydrocarbons that may be leaking into the shallow system are accompanied by brines from the same geo\u00ad logic unit(s). The biodegradation of petroleum hydrocarbons in groundwater often results in reducing conditions that can cause manganese and iron to dissolve from aquifer sediments (Klinchuch and Delfino (2000). Therefore, in areas with groundwater containing high manganese and iron content, the biodegradation of hydrocarbons from gas and oil sources in the area may be driving Eh values down resulting in the increased dissolution of manganese and iron. Well AR-0075 may be an extreme example of mechanisms that possibly play a role in con\u00ad trolling the spatial variability of redox conditions in the shallow aquifer and should be studied in more detail. Dissolved aluminum was observed in several water samples. Excluding AR-0214, which had the highest concentration (0.161), aluminum concentra- tions ranged from 0.0005 to 0.0058 mg/L, and in 50% of water samples, concentrations were below the reporting limit of 0.0005 mg/L. Total dissolved alumi\u00ad num was observed in most water samples, indicating the presence of aluminum that is adsorbed on colloids or other particulates in the water sample. A likely source for this colloidal aluminum is sediments and colloids from the Animas river, which may have origi\u00ad nated from mines in the headwaters near Silverton, Colorado and possibly the Gold King Mine spill. Fortunately, aluminum is relatively insoluble in the alluvial aquifer due to pH values being near neutral. However, small changes in pH can result in higher dissolved aluminum concentrations in groundwater. 59 G R O U N D W A T E"

The pur\u00ad pose of this project was to evaluate possible effects from the mine release on the shallow groundwater near the Animas River in New Mexico. Analysis of water level and geochemical data collected between January 2016 and June 2017 have greatly improved our understanding of the hydrogeologic system in the Animas River Valley, including the identification of recharge sources, groundwater flow paths, groundwa\u00ad ter/surface water interactions, and mechanisms by which potential contaminants may be mobilized in the shallow aquifer system. The primary recharge source is river water via irrigation, where water infiltrates through the bot\u00ad toms of irrigation ditches and canals and through soils in agricultural fields to the water table, which is usually less than 20 feet below the surface. This is an important consideration with regard to the Gold King Mine spill and possible impacts to groundwater qual\u00ad ity. Contaminated sediment associated with the Gold King Mine spill that was possibly deposited in irrigation ditches and canals during or after the release, can possibly result in the contamination of the shallow aquifer. U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (2017) reported that much of the sediment deposited in the Animas River by the Gold King Mine spill was mobilized by large flow events that occurred after the spill, such as the spring snow melt flood in 2016. As irrigation water infiltrates through these sediments, metals such as iron, manganese and aluminum may be mobilized and transported to the shallow water table. So far, the groundwater qual\u00ad ity does not appear to have been impacted through this recharge mechanism. However, continued monitoring of groundwater quality is recommended. Groundwater in the alluvial aquifer is estimated to be, on average, less than 10 years old and is a mixture of very young water derived from recent spring runoff in the San Juan Mountains and older V . C O N C L U S I O N S irrigation recharge from past irrigation seasons. Therefore it may be several years before an impact to water quality in the shallow aquifer can be observed. An important process that affects groundwater quality in the shallow aquifer is the input of regional groundwater that flows upward from the Nacimiento and Ojo Alamo Formations that underlie the alluvium. Most recharge to these deeper bedrock aquifers occurs at the edge of the San Juan Basin in the San Juan Mountains around Durango. This water was deter\u00ad mined to be thousands of years old and is observed in small proportions in almost all of the groundwater that was sampled in the Animas River alluvial aquifer. Groundwater south of Aztec was observed to have a larger proportion of this regional component (up to 15% of the total water mixture) due to the thinning of the Nacimiento and Ojo Alamo Formations (Figure 52), which pinch out near Farmington due the struc\u00ad ture of the San Juan Basin. This mixing process sig\u00ad nificantly affects the sulfate and total dissolved solids concentrations, which are observed to be higher south of Aztec (Figure 25). While groundwater levels are usually above the river stage, wells that are in close proximity to the river (less than 300 feet) have a risk of pulling in river water into the aquifer, especially in areas where we occasionally observe a reversal of the hydraulic gradi\u00ad ent between the groundwater and river. These gradi\u00ad ent reversals were observed to occur north of Aztec around Cedar Hill and Inca, especially during the winter months. The implications related to the Gold King Mine spill, which occurred in August, is that these locations were likely still moving water toward the river, as gaining reaches, because the winter gradi\u00ad ent reversal had not begun. To avoid possible future contamination to groundwater, we recommend that residents with wells within 300 feet of the river should avoid pumping during turbid surface water condi\u00ad tions such as monsoon storm events, or in the event of another spill similar to the Gold King Mine spill. The input of irrigation water, which usually has high dissolved oxygen content, results in an observ\u00ad able increase in groundwater dissolved oxygen, which decreases fairly quickly due to mixing with ground\u00ad water that is depleted in dissolved oxygen and the N E W M E X I C O B U R E A U O F G E O L O G Y A N D M I N E R A L R E S O U R C E S 60 oxidation of organic matter by respiration.

Dissolved iron and manganese in groundwater is from the dissolution of manganese oxides and iron (hydr) oxides that occurs naturally in the sediments of the aquifer. Iron and manganese may also come from river sediments that are deposited in irrigation ditches and canals from irrigation diversions from the river. Irrigation managers may want to consider limiting diversions during high river flows that are likely mov\u00ad ing large amounts of sediments, such as storm events, and spring runoff floods. 61 G R O U N D W A T E R M O N I T O R I N G A L O N G T H E A N I M A S R I V E R , N M F uture work should include groundwater quality monitoring and sediment analysis in irrigation ditches. Continued monitoring of groundwater quality is necessary to assess possible impacts to groundwater quality from the Gold King Mine spill. Monitoring efforts should focus on shallow wells in close proximity and down gradient from irrigation ditches and canals and should include continuous measurements of water level, temperature, dissolved oxygen, and specific conductance and semi-annual sampling for general chemistry and trace metals. Results of this study provide information that can be used to help future monitoring efforts. For exam\u00ad ple, abrupt changes in continuous measurements of temperature, specific conductance, and water level associated with the commencement of flow in a nearby ditch would indicate that groundwater recharge is occurring near that location, likely as seepage through the bottom of the ditch. This infor\u00ad mation should be used to identify: 1) sampling wells that are most likely to provide pertinent informa\u00ad tion to help identify groundwater quality impacts from the Gold King Mine spill, and V I . F U T U R E W O R K 2) specific ditches and canals that should be stud\u00ad ied to assess the presence of contaminated sediment that may be associated with the Gold King Mine spill. Characterization of sediments associated with the Gold King Mine spill by U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (2017) should help to identify these sediments in irrigation waterways. Water chemistry data from semi-annual sampling of wells should be used to better understand redox chemistry in the shallow aquifer by identifying and confirming specific dominant redox pairs and reac\u00ad tions, such as MnO2/Mn2+ and Fe(OH)3/Fe2+. Future work should also focus on identifying manganese and iron sources in groundwater throughout the study area, with the specific goal of differentiating in-place sources in the aquifer sediments from sources origi\u00ad nating from river sediments that were mobilized and deposited in irrigation ditches. It is also recommended to assess the spatial distribution of reductants such as organic matter, septic waste, and hydrocarbons. Groundwater analyses for dissolved organic carbon, carbon isotopes, methane and other hydrocarbons would be useful for these purposes. Water is flowing out of the Red and Bonita Mine over orange stained waste rock piles. These waters contribute to Cement Creek, which flows into the Animas River near Silverton, Colorado.

As the authors, we thank our colleagues and collaborators at the New Mexico Environment Department including Dennis McQuillan and Diane Agnew for feedback and support on this project. We would like to thank Dr. Patrick Longmire at the New Mexico Environment Department for taking time to meet with us and helping review the geo\u00ad chemistry data. We also kindly thank the USGS New Mexico Water Science Center staff contributions for assistance in water level measurements in August 2015, including Jesse Driscoll, Lauren Sherson, Nicole Thomas, and Amy Gallanter. During the August 2015 water level measurements, we had cooperation and assistance also from the New Mexico Office of the State Engineer's Office staff, A C K N O W L E D G M E N T S particularly Doug Rappuhn, Rob Pine and Shawn Williams. We also thank Miriam Wamsley formerly with the New Mexico Department of Health for her help on water quality concerns related to private domestic wells.
