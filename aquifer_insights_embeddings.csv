{
  ""Query"": ""Did the study define subsurface structural controls on groundwater flow?"",
  ""Answer"": ""Yes, the study defined subsurface structural controls on groundwater flow. It mentioned enhanced recharge through sinkholes and solution-enlarged fractures associated with the Pecos Buckles, which are wrench fault zones extending southwest-northeast across the Pecos Slope. These structural features significantly influence the flow and recharge of groundwater in the area.""

}
```"
"```json
{
  ""Query"": ""Did the study define recharge and discharge zones?"",
  ""Answer"": ""Yes, the study defined recharge and discharge zones. The recharge zone is identified as the Principal Intake Area on the Pecos Slope where enhanced recharge occurs through sinkholes and solution-enlarged fractures. The discharge zones include areas where groundwater flows upward through leaky confining beds into the alluvial aquifer and ultimately to the Pecos River, as well as direct discharges into the river and adjacent wetlands through solution channels and sinkholes in the overlying gypsum confining beds.""

```"
"```json
{
  ""Query"": ""What data was used to define recharge and discharge zones?"",
  ""Answer"": ""The data used to define recharge and discharge zones included geological features such as sinkholes and solution-enlarged fractures, wrench fault zones, and karst features in the San Andres limestone. Additionally, tracer studies using environmental tracers like tritium, chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), and 14C were utilized to determine groundwater residence times and flow paths. Isotope investigations and measurements of tritium content in water samples from wells also contributed to defining these zones.""

"```json
{
  ""Query"": ""Did the study quantify recharge and discharge rates or amounts?"",

}
```"
"```json
{
  ""Query"": ""What data was used to quantify recharge and discharge rates or amounts?"",
